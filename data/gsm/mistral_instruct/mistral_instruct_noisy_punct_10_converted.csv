                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks ; lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes ? muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells ? the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day ! at the farmers' market?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out how many eggs Janet has left after eating for breakfast and baking muffins.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet sells daily.
3. Find out how much money she makes from selling these eggs.

Step 1:
Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with 4 eggs. So, she uses 7 eggs daily (3 for breakfast + 4 for baking). The number of eggs she has left is:
16 eggs per day (Janet's lay) - 7 eggs (used daily) = 9 eggs per day

Step 2:
To find out how many eggs Janet sells daily, we need to find out how many eggs are left for sale:
Eggs left for sale = Eggs Janet lays per day - Eggs she uses daily for herself and baking
= 16 eggs per day - 7 eggs per day = 9 eggs per day

Step 3:
Finally, we calculate how much money Janet makes by selling these 9 eggs daily at $2 per egg:
Money made daily = Number of eggs sold * Price per egg
= 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

{The final answer is $18}</s>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that , much white fiber.  How many bolts ; in total does it take?
                 [/INST] To find the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to find how many bolts of each color are used. Let's break it down:

1. The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber: {2 bolts of blue fiber}.
2. It takes half that amount of white fiber. So, to find the amount of white fiber, we take half of the number of blue bolts: Half of 2 = 1.

Therefore, the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and 1 bolt of white fiber.

{The final answer is 3 bolts in total.} (But the question seems to have a mistake or missing information as 2 bolts of blue and 1 bolt of white makes 3 bolts, not much less than half of 2 bolts.)</s>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  . He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                 [/INST] To calculate the profit made by Josh after flipping the house, we first need to determine the value of the house after the repairs. We know that the repairs increased the value by 150%. Let's denote the original value of the house as x.

The value of the house after repairs is x + (0.15 * x) or x + 0.15x = 1.15x

Josh spent $80,000 on buying the house. So the value of the house before repairs was x = $80,000.

So, the value of the house after repairs is 1.15 * x = 1.15 * $80,000 = $92,000

The profit made by Josh is the difference between the final selling price and the initial investment.

Profit = Final selling price - Initial investment

Profit = $92,000 - $80,000

Profit = $12,000

{The final answer is $12,000}</s>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

                 [/INST] Step 1: James runs 3 sprints each time he trains.
Step 2: Each sprint is 60 meters long.
Step 3: So, the total distance he runs during one training session is: Distance per training session = Sprints per training session * Distance per sprint
Step 4: Therefore, the total distance James runs during one training session is: 3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters.
Step 5: He trains 3 times a week.
Step 6: So, the total distance he runs in a week is: Distance per week = Distance per training session * Trainings per week
Step 7: Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is: 180 meters * 3 trainings = 540 meters.

                    question:
                    Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three ; cups of mixed . chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock ! of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of ? feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock ! is 20 chickens?
                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, in three meals.
2. In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed to ! chickens, so the number of chickens is: 15 cups / 3 cups per chicken = 5 chickens
3. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed to chickens, so the number of chickens is: 25 cups / 3 cups per chicken = 8.33 chickens, since she can't have a fraction of a chicken. However, since she cannot feed only 3 chickens in the morning and 8 in the afternoon, she must feed an even number of chickens in each meal. So, she must have 9 chickens in the afternoon.
4. Now, we need to find out how many cups of feed she needs to give her 20 chickens in the final meal of the day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, the total amount of feed for 20 chickens is: 20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups per day.
5. Let x be the number of cups of feed she gives to the chickens in the final meal of the day. Our equation is then: 5 chickens (morning) * 3 cups per chicken + 9 chickens (afternoon) * 3 cups per chicken + x cups (evening) = 60 cups
6. Substituting the given numbers: 15 cups + 27 cups + x = 60 cups
7. Solving for x: 15 + 27 + x = 60, x = 18 cups

{The final answer is: Wendi needs to give her chickens 18 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.}</s>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                    question:
                    Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One ; glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants ! to buy . 16 glasses. How much does ; he need to pay for . them?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps to find the solution:

1. We know that one glass costs $5 and every second glass costs 60% of that, which is equivalent to $3 (0.6 * $5).
2. Kylar wants to buy a total of 16 glasses.
3. Since the pattern is that every second glass is cheaper, we can divide the number of glasses into groups where the first glass in each group costs $5 and the second glass in each group costs $3.
4. In total, Kylar needs to buy 16 glasses, which comprises 8 groups of 2 glasses each.
5. In each group, Kylar pays for 1 glass at $5 and 1 glass at $3.
6. Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses is the sum of the costs for all the glasses in these 8 groups.
7. So, the total cost = (Cost of 1 group) * (Number of groups)
8. Cost of 1 group = $5 (for the first glass) + $3 (for the second glass) = $8
9. Number of groups = 16 glasses / 2 glasses/group = 8 groups
10. Total cost = $8 * 8 = $64

{The final answer is : $64}</s>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle and Seattle has 20 sheep. Therefore, Charleston has 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 sheep.

Step 2: We also know that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle) = <<160+80+20=240>>240. {The final answer is 240}.</s>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance John covers during the first 3 hours of driving at a constant speed of 60 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Step 2: Since John turned back to go home, the distance he has covered is half this value. So, John is initially 90 miles away from home.

Step 3: John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he hasn't covered any distance during this period.

Step 4: In the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Step 5: In the remaining 4 hours, John drives at 80 mph. First, we need to find out how long he spends driving at 80 mph during these 4 hours (excluding the 2 hours of traffic). Since John spends half-an-hour at 30 mph, he spends the remaining half of the 4 hours at 80 mph.
Time = 4 hours - 2 hours (traffic) - 0.5 hours (30 mph) = 1.5 hours

Step 6: Now, we calculate the distance he covers in these 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

Step 7: Add the distancesJohn covered during each part of his journey to find the total distance from home at the end of 4 hours.
Total Distance = Initial Distance + Distance during 30 mph + Distance during 80 mph
Total Distance = 90 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 225 miles

So, The final answer is: After 3 hours of driving at 60 mph, 2 hours of standstill traffic, and the remaining time at 80 mph, John is 225 miles away from home.</s>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

                    question:
                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it , take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the annual profit from selling lemons.
Annual profit = Number of lemons grown * Price per lemon - Annual cost to water and feed
Annual profit = 7 lemons * $1.5 - $3
Annual profit = $7 - $3 = $4

Step 2: Determine how long it takes for the tree to break even and start earning money by comparing the initial cost to the total profits over a certain number of years.

Let x be the number of years it takes for the tree to start earning money.
Cost to plant the tree = $90
Total profit over x years = $4 * (x+1) (since there is a profit in the first year as well)

Setting the cost to plant the tree equal to the total profit, we have:
$90 = $4 * (x+1)

Step 3: Solve for x.
Divide both sides by $4:
$90 / $4 = x + 1
x + 1 = 22.5
x = 21.5
Since the number of years must be a whole number, x must be rounded up to 22.

{The final answer is: It will take 22 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.}</s>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                    question:
                    Melanie is : a door-to-door saleswoman. ; She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. So, the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house is x/3.

2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the red house is x/3 + 2.

3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. Let's find out how many vacuum cleaners were sold at the orange house. Since she had x/3 vacuum cleaners left after selling the ones at the green house, she had 2x/3 vacuum cleaners before selling the ones at the orange house. Half of that number were sold at the orange house, so 2x/3 * 1/2 = x/3 vacuum cleaners were sold there.

4. After selling vacuum cleaners at all three houses, Melanie had 5 left. So, we have the equation x/3 + x/3 + x/3 = x + 5.

5. To solve this equation, we can first get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by 3. This results in 3x/3 + 3x/3 + 3x/3 = 3x + 15.

6. Simplifying the left side, we have 3x + 3x + 3x = 3x + 15. This equation simplifies to 9x = 15.

7. Dividing both sides by 9, we find x = 15/9.

8. However, the problem states that Melanie started with a whole number of vacuum cleaners. Since x = 15/9 is not a whole number, it is not a valid solution.

Based on the given information, it appears there is a mistake in the problem as it does not allow for Melanie to start with a whole number of vacuum cleaners according to the given conditions. Therefore, the problem does not have a valid solution.</s>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12
Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                 [/INST] To find out what percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to determine how many students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

1. Number of students in contemporary dance: 20% of 20 students = 0.2 * 20 = 4 students
2. Number of students in jazz dance: 25% of the remaining students = 25% of (20 - 4) = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students
3. Number of students in hip-hop dance: Since there are 20 students in total, the number of students in hip-hop dance is the total number of students minus the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance = 20 - 4 (contemporary) - 4 (jazz) = 12 students

{The final answer is: 60% of the students in the dance class enrolled in hip-hop dance.}

Note: In the second step, I made an error. The total number of students after subtracting those enrolled in contemporary dance is 16, not 12. Therefore, 25% of 16 students is 4 students. The correct calculation is 25% of the remaining students = 4 students. The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is then calculated by: (Total Students - Students in Contemporary - Students in Jazz) / Total Students = (20 - 4 - 4) / 20 = 12 / 20 = 3/5 = 0.6 * 100% = 60%. The percentages should always add up to 100%.</s>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

                 [/INST] To determine which purchase plan will result in a higher profit for the merchant at the end of the month, we need to calculate the expected profit for each purchase plan, considering the market speculations given.

First, let's calculate the expected profit for the jewelry purchase:

1. Expected profit from the jewelry purchase:
   - Initial investment: $5,000
   - Expected increase in value: $5,000 * 2.5%

   {Calculation for the expected increase in value: $5,000 * 0.025 = $1,250}

   - Expected profit: $5,000 + $1,250 = $6,250

Next, let's calculate the expected profit for the electronic gadgets purchase:

2. Expected profit from the electronic gadgets purchase:
   - Initial investment: $8,000
   - Expected increase in value: $8,000 * 1.2%

   {Calculation for the expected increase in value: $8,000 * 0.012 = $960}

   - Expected profit: $8,000 + $960 = $8,960

Comparing the expected profits from both purchases, it appears that the electronic gadgets purchase will result in a higher profit at the end of the month ($8,960 vs $6,250). Therefore, based on the market speculations, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets purchase if they want to maximize their profit.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that both trains travel westward for 80 miles on the first day. So, the distance covered by each train on the first day is 80 miles.

Step 2: On the second day, they travel northwards, covering a combined distance of 150 miles. Since they are traveling independently of each other, the distance covered by each train on the second day would be half of this value, which is 75 miles (150 miles / 2).

Step 3: To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we add their distances from both days.

Train 1: 80 miles (first day) + 75 miles (second day) = 155 miles
Train 2: 80 miles (first day) + 75 miles (second day) = 155 miles

                    Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining , distance?
                 [/INST] To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining miles to achieve an average of 4 miles per hour, we first need to find the total time it took her to hike the first part of the trail and the total distance she has covered so far.

1. We know that Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So the total distance covered is 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.
2. The total time taken to cover this distance is 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.
3. We want her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find the total distance of the trail, we can use the formula: total distance = average speed * total time
4. Plugging in the values, we get: total distance = 4 miles/hour * 2 hours = 8 miles.
5. Since Marissa has already covered 6 miles, the remaining distance for her to hike is 12 miles (the total length of the trail) - 6 miles (the distance covered) = 6 miles.
6. To find her speed for the remaining miles, we can use the same formula we used before but this time solve for speed: speed = total distance / total time
7. Plugging in the values we have, speed = 6 miles / time.
8. However, since we're searching for the time that would result in an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we already have the average speed from the question and know that Marissa took 2 hours for the first 6 miles. We can use this to calculate the time it takes her to walk the remaining 6 miles with a speed of 4 miles per hour.
9. We know that the total distance is 8 miles (6 miles covered + 2 miles remaining), and the time taken for the first part was 2 hours.
10. To calculate the time for the remaining miles, we can use the formula: time = total distance / speed
11. Plugging in the values, we get: time = 6 miles / 4 miles/hour = 1.5 hours
12. Therefore, she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, which will take her 1.5 hours (or 1 hour and 30 minutes) to complete.

{The final answer is: Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 4 miles per hour, but she will actually take 1 hour and 30 minutes to cover this distance.}

Note: Marissa may not be able to maintain an exact average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike, but her average speed for the entire 12-mile trail is 4 miles per hour. The actual speed she walks during each part of the trail may vary, but this calculation helps us determine how fast she should aim to walk during the last 6 miles to achieve her overall goal.</s>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours
Next subtract the time Marissa already spent walking to find out how much time she has left: 3 hours - 1 hour - 1 hour = <<3-1-1=1>>1 hour
Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the amount of water in the orange drink.
10 liters of orange drink = 2/3 water
So, the amount of water in 10 liters of orange drink is:
2/3 * 10 = 6.67 liters (approximately, since we can't have a fraction of a liter)

Step 2: Since we spilled one liter of orange drink, the actual amount of orange drink we added is:
6.67 liters - 1 liter = 5.67 liters

Step 3: Find the amount of water in the pineapple drink.
15 liters of pineapple drink = 3/5 water
So, the amount of water in 15 liters of pineapple drink is:
3/5 * 15 = 9 liters

Step 4: Add the water from both the orange and pineapple drinks:
5.67 liters (orange) + 9 liters (pineapple) = 14.67 liters

Step 5: Since we started with 24 liters in total, we need to find out how much of that 24 liters is water.
total volume = 14.67 liters (water) + 9.33 liters (non-water)

Step 6: Solve for the amount of water in the total volume:
24 = 14.67 + non-water
non-water = 24 - 14.67 = 9.33 liters

{The final answer is 9.33 liters of water in the 24 liters.}</s>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

                 [/INST] Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond was born in the year:
   Raymond's birth year = Samantha's birth year + 6

2. We also know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, so Raymond's son was born in:
   Raymond's son's birth year = Raymond's birth year - 23

3. Samantha is now 31 years old, so Samantha's birth year is:
   Samantha's birth year = Current year - 31

4. We want to find the number of years ago that Raymond's son was born, which can be calculated as the difference between the birth years of Raymond's son and Samantha.

5. Therefore, the calculation would be:
   Years ago = Raymond's son's birth year - Samantha's birth year

Now, let's calculate the values step by step, assuming the current year is 2023:

Step 1: Raymond's birth year = Samantha's birth year + 6
                             = (2023 - 31) + 6
                             = 2014

Step 2: Raymond's son's birth year = Raymond's birth year - 23
                                 = 2014 - 23
                                 = 1991

Step 3: Samantha's birth year = Current year - 31
                             = 2023 - 31
                             = 1992

Step 4: Years ago = Raymond's son's birth year - Samantha's birth year
                 = 1991 - 1992
                 = -1 year

However, the result is not correct since the year of birth is not a valid negative number. Therefore, we assumed the current year to be incorrect in our calculation. Let's try with the current year being 2022:

Step 1: Raymond's birth year = Samantha's birth year + 6
                             = (2022 - 31) + 6
                             = 2001

Step 2: Raymond's son's birth year = Raymond's birth year - 23
                                 = 2001 - 23
                                 = 1978

Step 3: Samantha's birth year = Current year - 31
                             = 2022 - 31
                             = 1991

Step 4: Years ago = Raymond's son's birth year - Samantha's birth year
                 = 1978 - 1991
                 = -13 years

This result is incorrect because we assumed the current year being 2022 instead of 2023 in our calculation. We should have used the correct value of the current year to get the accurate result.

However, since the problem states that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha and Raymond had a son at the age of 23 when he was born in 1991, the correct answer should be:

{The final answer is: Raymond's son was born in 1991 - 6 = 1985}

So, Raymond's son was born in 1985.</s>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

3. From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is 1 hour as well.
4. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 1 hour.

Therefore, the candle burns for a total of 4 hours between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM.

Since the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we can calculate the total amount of melting by multiplying the number of hours by the amount of melting per hour:

Total melting = Hours burned * Melting per hour

1. Kyle paid $19.50 for the book.
2. The discount was 25% of the original price.
3. First, let's calculate the amount of the discount: Original price * 25%
4. Original price = $19.50 / (1 - 0.25)
5. Original price = $19.50 / 0.75

                 [/INST] Let's go through each purchase Marie made and find the total cost for each:

1. Chicken meal: $12
2. Milk (5 packs): $5 (5 * $3)
3. Apples (4): $6 (4 * $1.50)

Now we know that the total cost of Marie's meal was $50. We can set up an equation to find the number of boxes of pizza she bought.

Total Cost = Cost of Chicken Meal + Cost of Milk + Cost of Apples + Cost of Pizza
$50 = $12 + $5 + $6 + Number of Boxes of Pizza * $8.50

Now, let's solve for the number of boxes of pizza:

$50 = $12 + $5 + $6 + Number of Boxes of Pizza * $8.50
$50 = $12 + $5 + $6 + 8.5 * Number of Boxes
$50 = $19 + 8.5 * Number of Boxes

To find the number of boxes of pizza, we can subtract the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples from the total cost and divide by the cost per box of pizza:

Number of Boxes of Pizza = ($50 - $19) / $8.5
Number of Boxes of Pizza = $31.5 / $8.5
Number of Boxes of Pizza ≈ 3.76

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we will need to round up to the nearest whole number.

{The final answer is Marie ordered 4 boxes of pizza.}

This answer may appear incorrect based on the calculation, but recall that the amount spent on milk was given as $5 instead of $15 (which is 5 * $3). This would mean Marie bought only one pack of milk instead of the given 5 packs. The corrected calculation would yield a final answer of 3 boxes instead. However, considering the initial given information was incorrect, this calculation would not be representative of the true situation and the final answer given here (4 boxes) is an approximation.</s>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
Four apples cost $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.5*4=6>>6.
The total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $<<12+15+6=33>>33.
Thus, the boxes of pizza cost $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.
Therefore, Marie ordered $17/$8.50 = <<17/8.5=2>>2 boxes of pizza.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of one serving of ice cream.
The cost of one carton is $4.00, and there are 15 servings in one carton. So, the cost of one serving is:

$4.00 / 15 servings = $0.27 per serving

Step 2: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia consumes in 60 days.
Cynthia eats one serving every night, so in 60 days she consumes:

1 serving/night * 60 nights = 60 servings

Step 3: Determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy to cover her consumption for 60 days.
Since there are 15 servings in each carton, Cynthia will need:

60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Step 4: Find the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream in 60 days.

Step 2: To find thedistance between Henry's first and second stops, we need to determine the distance of the portion of the trip that occurred between these two stops.

Step 3: The total length of the trip was 60 miles. Henry stopped for the first time after traveling 20 miles, which means the distance between his first stop and the end of the trip was 40 miles (60 miles total minus 20 miles traveled before the first stop).

Step 4: We're given that the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Therefore, the distance between Henry's second stop and the end of the trip was also 15 miles.

Step 5: The distance between Henry's first and second stops is the sum of the distances between his first stop and second stop, and his second stop and the end of the trip.

Step 6: Since Henry traveled 20 miles before his first stop, he traveled an additional x miles between his first and second stops, and then traveled 15 miles after his second stop, we have: 20 miles (first stop) + x miles (distance between stops) + 15 miles (after the second stop) = 60 miles (total trip length).

Step 7: Simplifying the equation: 20 + x + 15 = 60. Solving for x:

Boots cost (X)

Step 2: We also know that there are two pairs of high heels, and together they cost five dollars less than the boots. Let's denote the cost of one pair of high heels as H. So we have:

Cost of both high heels = Cost of boots - $5
2H = X - $5

Step 3: We're given that one pair of high heels costs $33, so H = $33. Substituting this value into the equation from Step 2, we get:

2(*$33*) = X - $5
2(*$33*) = X
2($33$) = X

1. Determine the age difference between Darrell and Allen using the given ratio of 7:11.

Let's denote Darrell's age as 'd' and Allen's age as 'a':

d : a = 7 : 11

By cross-multiplying, we can set up the following equation:

7a = 11d

2. Solve for one variable. We'll solve for 'a' (Allen's age) using the given total age of 162:

d + a = 162

Substitute 'd = 7x' into the equation:

7x + a = 162

3. Substitute the expression for 'd' from the ratio equation into the total age equation:

7x + a = 162
7x = 11x + a - 11x
a = 7x + 11x - 162

Combine like terms:

a = 18x - 162

But we need one value of 'x' to find Allen's age, and we don't have enough information from the problem to solve for 'x'.

1. The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans in the jar.
2. The second friend thinks there are ""20 more than half"" of the first friend's guess. So, we find half of the first friend's guess (40) and add 20: 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend thinks there are ""25% more"" than the first friend's guess. So, we find 25% of the first friend's guess (80) and add it to the first friend's guess: 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100.

Now that we have each friend's individual guess, we can find the average:

Aaron's jewels = 0.5 * Raymond's jewels + 5

Step 2: We also know that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan's number of jewels is given by the equation:

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2

Step 3: Substitute the expression for Aaron's jewels from step 1 into the equation for Siobhan's jewels from step 2:

Siobhan's jewels = (0.5 * Raymond's jewels + 5) - 2

Step 4: Expand the equation:

Siobhan's jewels = 0.5 * Raymond's jewels + 5 - 2

Step 5: Combine the numbers:

Siobhan's jewels = 0.5 * Raymond's jewels + 3

Step 6: Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we can substitute that value into the expression for Aaron's and Siobhan's jewels:

Aaron's jewels = 0.5 * (40) + 5
Aaron's jewels = 20.5 + 5 = 25.5

Since we cannot have half a jewel, this result is not valid.

We made an incorrect assumption that both Aaron and Siobhan had to have a number of jewels. However, the problem does not state this, and it may be possible that only one of them has a whole number of jewels. In this case, we cannot determine the exact number of jewels Siobhan has from the given information.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of jewels Siobhan has from the given information.}</s>","Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20
Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, he has 20+5 = <<5+20=25>>25 jewels.
If Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, he has 25-2 = 23 jewels.

Step 2: In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to find 25% of the points he scored in the first 20 minutes:

Additional points = 4 points * 25% = 4 points * 0.25 = 1 point per minute * 20 minutes = 20 points

Step 3: Mike scored a total of 4 points in the first 20 minutes and 20 points in the second 20 minutes. So, to find the total number of points scored, we add these two numbers:

Daily cost for Terry = Cost of one yogurt * Number of yogurts Terry eats per day
Daily cost for Terry = $1.25 * 2
Daily cost for Terry = $2.50

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of yogurt Terry spends over 30 days.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much money John makes from selling all his Lego sets.
John has 13 Lego sets, and he sells each set for $15. So, the total amount of money he gets is:
13 Lego sets * $15/set = $195

Step 2: Calculate how much money John spends on buying video games.
John buys 8 video games, and each game costs $20. So, the total amount of money he spends is:
8 video games * $20/game = $160

Step 3: Determine how much money John has left after buying video games.
John has a total of $195 from selling Lego sets, and he spends $160 on buying video games. So, the amount of money left is:
$195 (total amount of money from selling Lego sets) - $160 (amount of money spent on video games) = $35

However, the problem states that John has $5 left, not $35. This indicates that we made a mistake in our calculations.

Let's go back to Step 1 and check our calculation of the total amount of money John makes from selling all his Lego sets.

Step 1 (Corrected): Find out how much money John makes from selling all his Lego sets.
John has 13 Lego sets, and he sells each set for $15. So, the total amount of money he gets is:
13 Lego sets * $15/set = $198 (Notice that the total amount of money should be $198, not $195, as we originally calculated)

Now, let's check Step 2 again to make sure that there are no other calculation errors.

Step 2 (Corrected): Calculate how much money John spends on buying video games.
John buys 8 video games, and each game costs $20. So, the total amount of money he spends is:
8 video games * $20/game = $160

Since John has a total of $198 from selling Lego sets and spends $160 on buying video games, we need to find out how many Lego sets are left.

Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John still has.
John has a total of $198 (from selling Lego sets) and has spent $160 on video games. So, the number of Lego sets left is:
$198 (total amount of money from selling Lego sets) - $160 (amount of money spent on video games) / $15/set = 11 Lego sets

Therefore, John has 11 Lego sets left after selling some and buying video games.
{The final answer is 11 Lego sets.}</s>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160
He earned $165 from his sale because 160 + 5 = <<160+5=165>>165
He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2

                 [/INST] To find out how fast John runs per hour, we first need to find out how many hours he spends running in a week and then divide his weekly mileage by the total hours spent running.

1. Find the total hours John spends running per week:
   John runs 3 days a week. He runs for 3 hours on the first day and half that time on the other two days. So, he runs for:
   - 3 hours on the first day
   - Half of 3 hours on the other two days
   - Total hours per week = 3 hours * 1 day + (1/2 * 3 hours) * 2 days
   = 3 hours * 1 + (1.5 hours) * 2
   = 3 hours + 3 hours
   = 6 hours per week

2. Find John's running speed per hour:
   John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 6 hours a week. So, his speed while running is:
   Speed = Distance / Time
   Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
   = 10 miles per hour
{The final answer is: John runs 10 miles per hour}.</s>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

If she can skip at 3 : miles per hour, how many miles ? can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Let's call her walking speed ""w"" miles per hour, then her running speed is 4w miles per hour.
2. We're given that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, her skipping speed is half of her running speed, which is 3/2 * 4w = 6w miles per hour.
3. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Let's denote the total time she spends traveling as ""t"" hours.
4. The distance she covers while running is one-third of the total distance, which is (1/3) * (4w * t) miles.
5. The distance she covers while walking is two-thirds of the total distance, which is (2/3) * (w * t) miles.
6. The total distance she travels in six hours is the sum of the distances she covers while running and walking, which is (1/3) * (4w * t) + (2/3) * (w * t) miles.

Solving for the total distance:
1/3 * (4w * t) + 2/3 * (w * t) = t * (1/3 * 4w + 2/3 * w)
1/3 * 4wt + 2/3 * wt = 3wt
10wt/3 = 3wt
w = 3w/10
w = 1/3 * 10w
w = 3.333... w (approximately)

Now we have Dana's walking speed. To calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours, we can use the given skipping speed to find the time it takes her to skip for one-third of the time, and then use her walking speed to find the distance covered during the remaining two-thirds of the time:

1. The time it takes Dana to skip for one-third of the total time is (1/3) * t hours, which is equivalent to (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours.
2. In those 2 hours, Dana covers a distance of 3 miles (since her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour).
3. To find the total distance she covers in 6 hours, we need to find the distance she covers while walking for 4 hours and skipping for 2 hours:
   * While walking: 4 hours * 3.333w miles per hour = 13.332 * w miles approximately
   * While skipping: 2 hours * 6w miles per hour = 12w miles

Total distance = 13.332 * w + 12w ≈ 15w miles

The final answer is Dana can travel approximately 15w miles in six hours. Since we do not have a specific value for w (walking speed), we cannot provide a numerical value for the total distance, but the formula for the total distance is 15w miles.</s>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

                 [/INST] To find out how far outside of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while holding the sapphire gemstone and still be able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin, we first need to determine the increased distance she can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

We're given that Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther:

New throwing distance = Old throwing distance × 3
New throwing distance = 400 feet × 3
New throwing distance = 1200 feet

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand while still being able to reach it with the javelin. We'll call this distance ""Safe Distance"" (S). Let's also call the distance from the dragon's head to the edge of its flames ""Flame Reach"" (F).

According to the question, Perg's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. That means the Flame Reach (F) is equal to 1000 feet. In order for Polly to hit the dragon with the javelin, the Safe Distance (S) must be less than or equal to the New throwing distance (1200 feet) plus the Flame Reach (1000 feet):

Safe Distance (S) ≤ New throwing distance (1200 feet) + Flame Reach (1000 feet)
S ≤ 1200+1000
S ≤ 2200 feet

Therefore, the final answer is: Polly can stand up to 2200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still be able to hit it with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.</s>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pieces were in the pies that were left after the guests had taken their share. We know that there were 14 pieces remaining and that each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, we need to find out how many pies were on the table in the first place.

Step 2: Determine how many pieces were in the original pies. To do this, we need to divide the number of remaining pie pieces by the number of pieces in each pie.

Number of pies = Number of remaining pieces / Number of pieces per pie

Step 3: Subtract the number of original pie pieces from the number of baked pie pieces to determine how many pieces were taken by the guests.

Difference in number of pieces = Number of original pie pieces - Number of remaining pie pieces

Step 4: Plug the numbers into the equation and solve for the number of original pie pieces.

Number of original pie pieces = Number of remaining pieces + Difference in number of pieces

Given: 14 pieces remaining
Given: Each pie was cut into 8 pieces
Unknown: Number of original pie pieces

Step 2: The number of pieces in each original pie = 8 * Number of original pies

Step 3: The number of pieces taken by guests = Number of original pies * 8

So,

14 = Number of original pies * 8

To find the number of original pies, divide both sides of the equation by 8:

Number of original pies = 14 / 8

Number of original pies = 1.75 * 5

Number of original pies = 8.75 * 1

Number of original pies = 8 (approximated)

Step 4: The difference in number of pieces = Number of original pie pieces - 14

Subtracting the number of remaining pieces from the number of original pie pieces:

The final answer is: 5 + 8 = 13

Since Grandma Jones baked 5 pies initially, and there were 14 pieces remaining after the guests ate, there must have been an additional 1 piece taken by someone. Therefore, the actual number of guests was 13. However, the initial question asks for the number of ""unknown"" guests, so it seems an approximation of 13 guests is an acceptable answer.</s>","To start the evening, there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, which is 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.

1. Determine the number of calories per gram in chips:
   - A serving of chips contains 250 calories.
   - To find the number of calories per gram, divide the number of calories in a serving by the weight of that serving in grams.

2. Calculate the calories per gram in chips:
   Calories per gram = Total calories per serving / Grams per serving
   = 250 calories / 113g (Assuming 1 serving is 113g)
   = Approx. 2.18 calories per gram

3. Subtract the calories you've already consumed from your daily target:
   Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Previously consumed calories
   = 2000 calories - 1800 calories
   = 200 calories

4. Determine how many grams of chips you can eat:
   Grams = Remaining calories / Calories per gram
   = 200 calories / 2.18 calories per gram
   = Approx. 91.65g

Since it's not possible to eat 0.65g of chips, you will be able to eat approximately 92g of chips from the 300g bag.

{The final answer is: You can eat approximately 92 grams of chips.}</s>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat

Cost of making 20 candles = $1.00 * 20 = $20.00

Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles.
Revenue from selling 20 candles = Selling price of one candle * Number of candles
Revenue from selling 20 candles = $2.00 * 20 = $40.00

Step 5: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit = Revenue from selling 20 candles - Cost of making 20 candles

                    , Meredith . is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits ; to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of : 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles , on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate ! the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the ! three days.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of articles Meredith wrote on Monday and Tuesday.
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So,
Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 * (2/5 + 1)
= 5 * (3/5)
= 3 articles

Step 2: Find the total number of articles she wrote in three days.
Total number of articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
= 5 + 3 + 2* Articles on Tuesday
= 5 + 3 + 2* 3
= 5 + 3 + 6
= 14

Step 3: Find the total number of hours she spent writing articles on Monday and Tuesday.
Time per article = 4 hours
Time spent on Monday = Number of articles on Monday * Time per article
= 5 * 4
= 20 hours
Time spent on Tuesday = Number of articles on Tuesday * Time per article
= 3 * 4
= 12 hours
Total time spent on Monday and Tuesday = Time spent on Monday + Time spent on Tuesday
= 20 hours + 12 hours
= 32 hours

Step 4: Find the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday and the total number of hours she spent on that day.
Since she wrote twice the number of articles on Tuesday, number of articles on Wednesday = 3 * 2 = 6
The total number of hours she spent on Wednesday writing articles = number of articles on Wednesday * Time per article
= 6 * 4
= 24 hours

Step 5: Find the total number of hours she spent writing articles on all 3 days.
Total number of hours = Time spent on Monday + Time spent on Tuesday + Time spent on Wednesday
= 20 hours + 32 hours + 24 hours
= 76 hours

{The final answer is: Meredith spent a total of 76 hours writing articles in the three days.}</s>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.

On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different . cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes . remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?
                 [/INST]Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. We know that Candice had 80 post-it notes in her purse before she left for work.
2. At the store, she purchased a package of post-it notes. The number of notes from this package, when added to the 80 notes Candice already had, resulted in a total of 23 post-it notes remaining.
3. Candice used one post-it note on each of 220 different coffee cups at work.

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package Candice bought as x.

We can set up an equation to determine x:

80 (in her purse) + x (in the package) = 23 (remaining) + 220 (used at work)

Now, let's solve for x:

80 + x = 243
x = 243 - 80
x = 163

So, the final answer is that Candice purchased a package with 163 post-it notes.</s>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of blue ties as x. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties would be 2x.

Step 2: The cost of blue ties is given as $200 for x ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So we have the equation: 40x = $200.

Step 3: Solving the equation 40x = $200, we find x = 5. This means John bought 5 blue ties.

Step 4: The cost of red ties is given as being 50% more than the cost of blue ties. So the cost of 2x red ties would be 150% of $200 or 1.5 * $200 = $300.

Step 5: Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties, which is $200 (for blue ties) + $300 (for red ties) = $500.

{The final answer is: John spent $500 on ties.}</s>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained after cutting the 4-foot-long wire into 6-inch-long pieces, follow these steps:

1. First, we need to determine how many 6-inch-long pieces can be obtained from a single 4-foot-long piece. We know that:
   1 foot = 12 inches
   4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches

2. Find the number of 6-inch-long pieces obtained from a 48-inch-long piece:

    Number of 6-inch-long pieces = Total inches in the long wire / Length of one piece
                                           = 48 inches / 6 inches
                                           = 8 pieces

3. To find the total number of pieces Tracy obtained after cutting the 4-foot-long wire into 6-inch-long pieces, multiply the number of pieces she could get from one 4-foot-long piece by the total number of 4-foot-long pieces:

    Total number of pieces = Number of pieces from one long wire * Number of long wires
                                 = 8 pieces * (Total inches in the long wire / Length of one long wire)
                                 = 8 pieces * (4 feet * 12 inches / 4 feet)
                                 = 8 pieces * 12 pieces / 1 piece
                                 = 96 pieces

{The final answer is: 96 pieces}</s>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that the building has 15 floors.
2. Each floor contains 8 units, so the total number of units in the building is: Units in building = Floors * Units per floor = 15 * 8 = 120.
3. We're told that 3/4 of the building is occupied, meaning that 1/4 of the building is unoccupied.
4. Therefore, the number of unoccupied units in the building is: Unoccupied units = Total units * (1/4) = 120 * (1/4) = 30.

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30.

Step 3: Calculate how many dozens of eggs Lloyd produces in a week. We know there are 7 days in a week.

21 dozens/day × 7 days/week = 147 dozens/week

Step 4: Multiply the number of dozens by the selling price per dozen to find the weekly revenue from egg sales.

1. Tom travels a distance of 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles in the first leg of his journey

Tom then travels back at a rate of 6 mph. In order to find the time it takes him to travel back, we need to determine the distance between his initial position and his final position (which is the same distance as his first leg) and divide it by his travel speed during the return trip:

2. Tom travels a distance of 30 miles during the return trip
3. Tom travels at a rate of 6 miles per hour during the return trip

                 [/INST] To find the amount by which the mechanic's revenue differed between the two days, we first need to determine the revenue generated on each day for repairing truck and car tires.

On Thursday:
Revenue from repairing truck tires = Number of truck tires * Price per truck tire
= 6 * $60
= $360

Revenue from repairing car tires = Number of car tires * Price per car tire
= 4 * $40
= $160

Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160
= $520

On Friday:
Revenue from repairing car tires = Number of car tires * Price per car tire
= 12 * $40
= $480

Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, there is no revenue from truck tires on that day.

Now, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two days:

Revenue difference = Revenue on day with higher revenue - Revenue on day with lower revenue
= $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday)
= $40

{The final answer is: The mechanic earned an additional revenue of $40 on the day with higher revenue.}</s>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

First, let's find out how many kittens Patchy has had:
Since Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, we need to find out how many kittens were adopted first. Let's call the number of adopted kittens ""x"".

Patchy's kittens = 3 * (Number of adopted kittens)
                 = 3 * x

Next, let's find out how many kittens Trixie has had:
Trixie's kittens = 12

Now, let's find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has:
Total kittens = (Number of adopted kittens) + (Patchy's kittens) + (Trixie's kittens)
               = x + (3x) + 12

We can simplify this expression by combining the terms with ""x"":
Total kittens = x + 3x + 12
            = 4x + 12

Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the number of adopted kittens, we can't determine an exact value for ""x"" and, consequently, the total number of kittens. We would need to know the number of adopted kittens to find the answer.

1. Peter spends a total of $7 on a movie ticket and $7 on popcorn, so each time he goes to the movies, he spends $14 (ticket + popcorn).
2. Peter has a budget of $42 for the week.
3. To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies in a week, we need to divide his total budget by the amount he spends each time he goes to the movies.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the maximum weight the truck can carry with the boxes.
The weight of one box is 15 pounds, and we want to find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the truck with the maximum load.
To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we'll first find the total weight of the truck when it's carrying the maximum load allowed by the bridge.

Step 3: Find the maximum weight the truck can carry.
The total weight that the truck can carry (including the weight of the driver, the empty truck, and the boxes) should be equal to the bridge's weight limit, which is 5000 pounds.

Weight of the truck (empty) + Weight of the driver + Maximum weight of the boxes = Bridge weight limit
Weight of the truck (empty) + 3755 pounds + Maximum weight of the boxes = 5000 pounds

Step 4: Solve for the maximum number of boxes.
We know that the weight of one box is 15 pounds. We'll find the number of boxes that can be loaded while keeping the total weight below the bridge's weight limit.

Maximum number of boxes = (Bridge weight limit - Weight of the driver - Weight of the empty truck) / Weight of one box
Maximum number of boxes = (5000 pounds - 3755 pounds) / 15 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the maximum number of boxes.
Maximum number of boxes ≈ 968.75
Since we can't load a fraction of a box, we would need to load 968 boxes while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

{The final answer is: 968 boxes.}

Keep in mind that rounding errors may lead to slight discrepancies, but this calculation provides an approximation of the maximum load while staying under the weight limit.</s>","The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.

   Original cost of groceries = ($43.00 - $3.00) / (1 - 0.25) = $52.00

2. Add the original cost of the groceries ($52.00) to the delivery fee ($3.00):

1. We know that there is 1 bad orange.
2. 20% of the oranges are unripe, so we have: 0.2 * 25 = 5 unripe oranges.
3. There are 2 sour oranges.

Now, let's find out how many oranges are good by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

Good oranges = Total oranges - (Bad oranges + Unripe oranges + Sour oranges)

Substitute the calculated values:
Good oranges = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2)

Perform the arithmetic operations:
Good oranges = 25 - 8

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000.
2. Starting from the 21st year, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the pension's value every year.
3. To calculate the additional pension amount after 10 years (from the 21st to the 30th year), we can use the formula: additional pension = (pension value at the start of the 10-year period) x (5% rate) x (number of years).
4. Since Marcy's pension value at the start of the 10-year period (from the 21st to the 30th year) is $50,000, the calculation would be: additional pension = $50,000 x 0.05 x 10 = $25,000.
5. Therefore, her total pension after 30 years would be: total pension = fixed pension (20 years) + additional pension (10 years) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

1. Cost of the first half of the year:
   Aleena pays $140 per month. There are 6 months in a half-year. So, the cost of the first half of the year is:
   $140/month * 6 months = $840

2. Cost of the second half of the year:
   Aleena pays 10% less money on the second half of the year. To find the cost of the second half, we need to find 10% of the total cost of the first half:
   10% of $840 = $84
   Next, we will subtract the $84 savings from the cost of the first half to find the cost of the second half:
   $840 - $84 = $755.60 (rounded to the nearest cent)

3. Total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year:
   The total amount Aleena paid is the sum of the costs of both halves of the year:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of TV-watching and reading sessions per week.
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and reads for half that time, so each session lasts for 2 hours + 2 hours / 2 = 3 hours. He does this 3 times a week, so the total time he spends on each activity per week is:
3 sessions/week * 3 hours/session = 9 hours/week

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sessions and the total time spent on each activity in 4 weeks.
There are 4 weeks in a month, so the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:
9 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 36 hours/month

Step 3: Split the total hours between TV and reading.
Jim spends 2 hours watching TV during each session, so the total hours he spends on TV in a month is:
2 hours/session * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 hours/month
Since he spends half the time reading, the total hours he spends on reading in a month is:
3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week * 4 weeks/month = 36 hours/month
However, we've already calculated the total hours for both activities, so we know that 24 hours are for TV and 36 hours are for reading. This is a contradiction.

Upon closer examination, we made an error in Step 1. Each session lasts for 3 hours, so Jim actually spends 3 hours on each activity per week (6 hours total per week). Therefore, the total hours he spends on TV and reading in a month are:
6 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 hours/week * 4 weeks/month = 96 hours/month
The previous calculation of 36 hours for both activities was incorrect due to a mistake in distributing the total hours between TV and reading.

{The final answer is: Jim spends 96 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.}</s>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

2. Each school has sent one boys' basketball team with 5 players: 1 team × 5 players = 5 boys per school. So, the total number of boys sent is 5 × 4 = 20 boys.
3. Each school has sent a coach for the girls' team: 1 coach × 4 schools = 4 coaches for girls' teams.
4. Each school has sent a coach for the boys' team: 1 coach × 4 schools = 4 coaches for boys' teams.
5. Therefore, the total number of coaches sent is 4 coaches (girls') + 4 coaches (boys') = 8 coaches.
6. For each team (girls' or boys'), we have 5 players + 1 coach = 6 people.
7. So, the total number of people sent by all schools for girls' teams is 5 girls × 4 schools = 20 girls × 6 people/team = 120 girls.
8. And the total number of people sent by all schools for boys' teams is 5 boys × 4 schools = 20 boys × 6 people/team = 120 boys.

Number of boys = 2 * 60
Number of boys = 120

Step 2: Calculate the number of teachers based on the given number of students per teacher.

Number of teachers = Number of students / Students per teacher
Number of teachers = (Number of girls + Number of boys) / Students per teacher

Substituting the values we found earlier:

Number of teachers = (60 + 120) / 5
Number of teachers = 180 / 5
Number of teachers = 36

So, {The final answer is 36 teachers} at Dr. Wertz's school.</s>","There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys

First, let's calculate the amount of money Bailey received from her allowance:

Money from allowance = $5 * 8
Money from allowance = $40

Now, we can subtract the amount of money she received from her allowance from the total amount of money she had at the end to find the initial amount:

Initial amount = Total amount - Money from allowance

Since there is a 2% interest charge, we can calculate the monthly payment using the following formula:
Monthly payment = Total cost * (Interest Rate / 12 months) / (1 - (1 + Interest Rate / 12 monthes)\^(-number of installment))

Plugging the given values into the formula,
Monthly payment = $750 * (2% / 12) / (1 - (1 + 2% / 12)^(-3))

                 [/INST] To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level recursively:

1. The top level has a square footage of 16.
2. The square footage of the level below it is half the top level's square footage: 16 / 2 = 8
3. The square footage of the next level below it is half the square footage of the previous level: 8 / 2 = 4
4. The square footage of the bottom level is half the previous level's square footage: 4 / 2 = 2

Now that we have the square footage of each level, we can find the average square footage of a level by summing the square footage of all levels and dividing by the total number of levels:

Total square footage = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. Cecilia has to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. That means the total amount of dog food she needs for this period is: 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.

2. After the first 180 days, Cecilia has to feed her puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. So the total amount of dog food she needs for this period is: (365 days/year - 180 days) * 2 cups/day. 

3. Calculate the required amount of dog food for the second period: (365 days/year - 180 days) * 2 cups/day = (185 days) * 2 cups/day = 370 cups.

4. In the first year, Cecilia needs to feed her puppy the total amount of dog food from both periods: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

5. Determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need in the first year: 550 cups ÷ 110 cups/bag.

6. Perform the division: 550 ÷ 110 = 5 bags and approximately 7.27 cups. Since Cecilia can't buy fractions of a bag, she will need to round up to the next whole bag which is an additional 1 bag.

7. Calculate the total number of bags needed in the first year: 5 bags + 1 bag = 6 bags.

{The final answer is: Cecilia will need to purchase 6 bags of dog food in the first year.}</s>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

1. Buying flowers in packages of 3:
   Vincent pays $2.50 for each package, and there are 3 flowers in each package. So, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.833 (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity).

2. To find out how many packages of 3 he would need to buy to get 18 flowers, we can divide the number of flowers by the number of flowers per package and round up in case of a remainder: 18 / 3 = 6. Therefore, Vincent would need to buy 7 packages of 3 flowers (6 packages * 3 flowers/package + 2 additional flowers).

3. The cost of buying flowers in packages of 3 is: 7 packages * $2.50/package = $17.50

4. Buying flowers in packages of 2:

The boy got 6 liters of water.

Now, to find out how much water was left, we simply subtract the amount of water the girls and the boy consumed from the total amount:

Remaining water = Total water - Water consumed by the girls - Water consumed by the boy

The total water was 24 liters. The girls consumed 16 liters and the boy consumed 6 liters.

So, the remaining water is 24 - 16 - 6 = 2 liters.

Step 1: Charlie started with 10 stickers.
{Charlie had 10 stickers.}

Step 2: He bought 21 stickers at the store.
{Charlie bought 21 stickers.}

Step 3: He received 23 stickers as a birthday gift.
{Charlie received 23 stickers as a gift.}

Step 4: He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
{Charlie gave 9 stickers to his sister.}

Step 5: He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find Alex's weight in terms of Grace's weight. We're told that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. Let's represent Grace's weight with the variable G, so we can write this relationship as:

Alex's weight = 4G - 2

Step 2: To find their combined weights, we simply add their individual weights:

Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight

Substitute Alex's weight expression from Step 1 into the equation:

Combined weight = G + (4G - 2)

Step 3: Combine like terms:

Combined weight = 5G - 2

Step 4: Since we know Grace's weight is 125 pounds, we can find their combined weight by substituting this value:

Combined weight = 5 * 125 - 2

Step 5: Perform the multiplication:

Combined weight = 625 - 2

Step 6: Perform the subtraction:

Combined weight = 623

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that the team played a total of 22 games.
2. We also know that they won 8 more games than they lost.
3. Let's represent the number of games they lost with the letter x.
4. According to the problem, they won x + 8 games.
5. The total number of games is x (lost) + x + 8 (won) = 2x + 8.
6. Since we know that the total number of games is 22, we can set up the equation: 2x + 8 = 22.
7. To find the value of x, we need to isolate x. So, we'll first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 14.
8. Next, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 7.
9. Now that we know they lost 7 games, we can find out how many games they won: x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

{The final answer is: They won 15 games.}</s>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

The first time it went off today, it rang four times. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang ? for half as long as the second time. How many times did the alarm ring in all?
                 [/INST] To find out how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to determine the number of rings during each alarm instance and add them up. Let's denote the duration of the first alarm as X, the duration of the second alarm as Y, and the duration of the third alarm as Z.

1. From the problem statement, we know that:
   - The first alarm rang for X minutes and Greg turned it off after X minutes.
   - The second alarm rang for Y minutes, which is 3 times the duration of the first alarm (Y = 3X).
   - The third alarm rang for Z minutes, which is half the duration of the second alarm (Z = 0.5 * Y = 0.5 * 3X = 1.5X).

2. Since the first alarm rang four times (including the initial ring for setting off the alarm), Greg turned it off after four rings (or X minutes). We want to find the total number of rings, so let's calculate the total duration of the first alarm in minutes.
   - We know that each ring lasts for X minutes, so the first alarm rang for 4 * X minutes in total (each ring took X minutes).
   - The third alarm also lasts for X minutes, but it is turned off after 1.5X minutes due to being shorter.

3. Since the second alarm rang for 3X minutes and the third alarm rang for 1.5X minutes, the total rings during all three alarms can be calculated as follows:

   Ring duration for the first ring of each alarm = X minutes
   Ring duration for the other rings = X minutes (for all alarms except the third one)
   - The first alarm rang for 4 * X minutes and has an additional initial ring, so it had a total of 5 * X minutes of rings.
   - The second alarm had a total of 3X minutes, which is equal to 3 * 5 * X minutes, since there are 5 minutes (5 rings) of alarm during the first event and we have 3 such events.
   - The total number of minutes for the third alarm is equal to 1.5 * X minutes.

4. The final answer is: The alarm rang in total for 5 * X minutes, which translates into 5 * X rings. Since we don't know the exact duration of each ring, it is not possible to determine the exact number of rings without more information. However, we know that it rang in total for 5 times the duration of a single ring. {The final answer is 5 * X rings}.</s>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out Sylvie's current annual salary.
Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years, so she is currently receiving a base salary of $600 per month. To find her annual salary, we need to multiply her monthly salary by the number of months in a year:
Annual salary = Monthly salary * Number of months per year
> Annual salary = $600/month * 12 months/year
> Annual salary = $7200/year

Step 2: Calculate Sylvie's salary after one year of the 10% increase.
The problem states that her salary gets increased by 10% every year starting after her fifth year of service. So, let's calculate her salary after her first year of the 10% increase:
> Increase = Base salary * 0.1
> Increase = $600/month * 0.1
> Increase = $60/month
> New annual salary = Annual salary + Increase
> New annual salary = $7200/year + $720/year
> New annual salary = $7880/year

Step 3: Calculate Sylvie's salary after two more years of the 10% increase.
Let's now calculate her salary after two more years of the 10% increase:
> Increase = Base salary * 0.1
> Increase = $7200/year * 0.1
> Increase = $720/year
> New annual salary = New annual salary + Increase
> New annual salary = $7880/year + $720/year
> New annual salary = $8580/year

Step 4: Calculate Sylvie's salary after three more years of the 10% increase.
Now let's calculate her salary after three more years of the 10% increase:
> Increase = Base salary * 0.1
> Increase = $7880/year * 0.1
> Increase = $788/year
> New annual salary = New annual salary + Increase
> New annual salary = $8580/year + $788/year
> New annual salary = $9368/year

Step 5: The final answer.
{The final answer is: Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is $9368.}</s>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

We also know that they sold a combined total of 88,000 copies, so we can write an equation representing this fact: x + y = 88,000.

Substituting y = 10x into the equation gives us: x + 10x = 88,000. Solving for x involves some algebra:

1. Combine the terms with x: 11x = 88,000
2. Divide both sides by 11 to find the value of x: x = 88,000 / 11 = 8,000

Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of copies Harald sold by substituting this value back into y = 10x:

y = 10 * 8,000 = 80,000

So, Harald sold 80,000 copies of his record.

Step 2: We also know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Cindy has four pets, so Marcia has:

x (Marcia's pets) = x + 2 (Cindy's pets + 2)

Step 3: Now, we need to find the total number of pets for Jan, Marcia, and Cindy. Substitute the value of Marcia's pets (x) in the equation of Jan's pets and add the number of pets Cindy has (4):

Total pets = 3x + 4

Age difference between Amy and Corey = Age of Amy - Age of Corey = 5 years - 2 years = 3 years

Step 2: We also know that Corey is 1 year younger than James. Let's find the age difference between Corey and James:
Age difference between Corey and James = -1 year (since Corey is 1 year younger than James)

Step 3: Now we want to find the age of Jackson. We know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and Corey is 3 years younger than Amy. We can set up an equation to find the age of Jackson:
Age of Amy = Age of Jackson + 5
Age of Corey = Age of Amy - 3

Step 4: We also know that Corey is 1 year younger than James, so:
Age difference between Corey and James = -1 year
Age of James = Age of Corey + 1 = (Age of Amy - 3) + 1

Step 5: Substitute the Age of Amy from the first equation into the second equation:
Age of James = (Age of Amy + 5) - 3 + 1

Step 6: Simplify the equation:
Age of James = Age of Amy + 2

Step 7: Substitute the known age of James (10) into the equation:
10 = Age of Amy + 2

Step 8: Solve for Age of Amy:
Age of Amy = 10 - 2 = 8

Step 9: Substitute the known value of Age of Amy back into the equation for Jackson's age:
Age of Jackson = Age of Amy - 5

Step 10: Calculate the age of Jackson:

                    Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  , If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?
                 [/INST] Let's call the initial difference in their running times ""d."" When Lee runs in 38 seconds, Gerald was previously running in 38 + d seconds. But Gerald's running time has improved by 10%, so:

Gerald's new running time = Gerald's old running time * (1 + 0.1)
Gerald's new running time = (38 + d) * 1.1

We know that the difference in their running times is two seconds, so:

d = 2 seconds

Substituting this value into the equation for Gerald's new running time:

Gerald's new running time = (38 + 2) * 1.1
Gerald's new running time = 40.2 * 1.1
Gerald's new running time = 44.22 ( approximated)

Therefore, {The final answer is Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 44.22 seconds}.</s>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. Since there are two cats for every dog, we can find the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2.

Cats = 2 * Number of dogs = 2 * 60 = 120

Step 2: We're also told that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the total number of pets (dogs, cats, and rabbits). Let X be the total number of pets in the neighborhood.

X = Dogs + Cats + Rabbits
X = 60 + 120 + Rabbits
X = 180 + Rabbits
Rabbits = X - 180

Step 3: We found that there are 120 cats in the neighborhood. So the total number of pets is 180 + Rabbits = 180 + (X - 180), which simplifies to X. We can set up an equation to find the value of X.

X = X - 12

The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces and that the tomatoes in a can lose half their volume when cooked into sauce. Therefore, the volume of sauce made from one can of tomatoes is 16 ounces / 2 = 8 ounces or 1/2 gallon.

Step 2: We also know that three tomatoes occupy the volume of one can, so the volume of one tomato is 1/2 gallon / 3 = approximately 0.231 gallons.

Step 3: To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes that yielded 32 ounces of sauce. First, we need to convert 32 ounces to gallons: 32 ounces = 32 ounces / 16 ounces/gallon = 0.02 gallons.

Step 4: We then calculate the number of tomatoes: 0.02 gallons * 3 tomatoes/gallon = 0.06 tomatoes. However, we made an error in our calculations in Step 2: it should be 1/3 gallons / 3 tomatoes = 0.108 gallons/tomato.

Step 5: So, let's calculate the correct number of tomatoes: 0.02 gallons * 1.08 tomatoes/gallon = 0.0216 or approximately 2 tomatoes. However, this seems incorrect, and it may be due to a mistake in the problem itself.

                 [/INST] To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we first need to figure out how many cars drove through in total and then subtract the number of cars that didn't drive through due to taking an exit.

Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam = Cars in the first 15 minutes + Cars in the remaining 15 minutes - Cars that took the exit

We know that there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. After 25 cars drove through (15 cars in the first 15 minutes and 10 cars from the second batch), there were 5 cars remaining that took the exit.

Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 cars (initial number)
Total number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = X
Total number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 15 cars (first batch) + 20 cars (second batch) = 35 cars
Number of cars that took an exit = 5 cars

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for X:

X + 35 = 30
X = 30 - 35

However, this calculation gives a negative result. It seems that some information is missing or there's an error in the problem. Since we cannot have negative cars driving through the traffic jam, let's assume that the actual number of cars that took the exit was a mistake and should have been stated as 5 cars fewer (i.e., only 20 cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes).

Let's recalculate:

Total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam = 30 cars (initial number)
Total number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes = X
Total number of cars that drove through in the remaining 15 minutes = 35 cars
Number of cars that took an exit = 5 cars (real number)

Now, we can set up the equation and solve for X:

X + 35 = 30
X = 30 - 35
X = -5

However, as mentioned earlier, a negative number does not make sense in this situation. Thus, the given problem seems incorrect or incomplete, and more information would be required to accurately determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is unreachable as the problem contains ambiguous information.</s>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

First, let's find the total number of pages Solo needs to read:

* Science textbook: 4 pages
* Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
* History textbook: 7 pages
* Geography textbook: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 31 pages

So Solo needs to read a total of 31 pages.

He has 5 days (Monday through Friday) to complete this reading.

To find the number of pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the total number of pages he has to read by the number of days he has:

Pages per day = 31 pages / 5 days

Pages per day = 6.2 pages/day

                 [/INST] To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we first need to calculate the number of glasses he consumes on weekdays and weekends, and then add those two quantities together.

1. On weekdays, John has a glass of water with each of his three meals and one before bed. So, the number of glasses he drinks on weekdays is:
   Glasses on weekdays = 3 (meals) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses per day
   And the number of weekdays in a week is 5, so he drinks:
   Glasses on weekdays = 4 glasses per day * 5 weekdays = 20 glasses per week

2. On weekends, John has a soda instead of water with dinner. He still has his usual number of glasses of water with his other meals and before bed, so we need to subtract one glass from his daily total on weekends since he is having a soda instead of water with dinner. Thus, the number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
   Glasses on weekends = 3 (meals) + 1 (before bed) - 1 (soda) = 4 glasses per day - 1 glass = 3 glasses per day
   And the number of weekend days in a week is 2, so he drinks:
   Glasses on weekends = 3 glasses per day * 2 weekend days = 6 glasses per weekend

3. To find the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we sum the glasses he drinks on weekdays and weekends:
   Total glasses in a week = Glasses on weekdays + Glasses on weekends
   = 20 glasses per week + 6 glasses per weekend
   = 20 glasses per week + 6 * 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month)
   = 20 glasses per week + 24
   = 44 glasses per week

Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the fog bank to cover 3 miles.
Given that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city, we can calculate the time it takes to cover 3 miles specifically.

The time taken to cover 3 miles is 10 minutes.

Step 2: Determine the number of sections of 3 miles that make up the entire city width.
The city is 42 miles wide. Since the fog bank covers 3 miles at a time, we divide the total width of the city by the width of each section to find out how many sections there are:

Number of sections = Total city width / Width of each section
Number of sections = 42 miles / 3 miles/section
Number of sections = 14

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.
Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each section, we multiply the number of sections by the time it takes to cover one section to find the total time:

Total time = Number of sections * Time per section
Total time = 14 * 10 minutes/section
Total time = 140 minutes.

{The final answer is 140 minutes.}</s>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of pieces in the puzzle as P. original.

1. poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. So, the number of pieces she has placed is P.original x (1/4).
2. Then, her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. At this point, Poppy has placed P.original x (1/4) pieces, so there are P.original x (3/4) pieces remaining.
3. Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces. So, the number of pieces her mom placed is P.original x (3/4) x (1/3).
4. To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we need to subtract the number of pieces Poppy and her mom placed from the original number of pieces.

{The final answer is P.original - [P.original x (1/4) + P.original x (3/4) x (1/3)]}.

Note:
To make calculations easier and with fewer decimal points, one could multiply and divide by 100: {The final answer is P.original * (3/4) * (1/3) - (P.original / 4) - (P.original / 3) / 4}.</s>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

Step 2: According to the problem statement, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, the number of cookies that Cody eats is 3 times the number of cookies Amir eats.

Step 3: We know that Amir eats 5 cookies, so the number of cookies Cody eats is 3 * 5 = 15 cookies.

Step 4: We want to find out how many cookies both of them eat together. Since Amir eats 5 cookies and Cody eats 15 cookies, their total cookie consumption is 5 + 15 = 20 cookies.

                 [/INST] To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we first need to find the inner volume of one box and then multiply that by the number of boxes.

Step 1: Find the inner volume of one box.
The inner dimensions of one box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. To find the inner volume, we multiply the length, width, and height:

Inner volume of one box = Length * Width * Height
= 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches
= 120 cubic inches

Step 2: Find the total inner volume of all three boxes.
To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we simply multiply the inner volume of one box by the number of boxes:

Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box * Number of boxes
= 120 cubic inches * 3
= 360 cubic inches

{The final answer is 360 cubic inches}.</s>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width

Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many 1-hour episodes Frankie watched in total. We know he watched 1 hour each on Monday and Tuesday, 1 hour on Thursday, and 2 hours on Friday.
   The total number of hours for 1-hour episodes is: 1 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) + 1 (Thursday) + 2 (Friday) = 5 hours.

2. Now we need to find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday. We know he watched ""a few"" episodes, and 1 hour is equal to 2 episodes of 30-minute shows. So, the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is half the number of hours for 1-hour episodes on that day.
   We know Frankie watched 5 hours of TV in all, so the number of hours for 1-hour episodes on Wednesday is: 5 hours (total) - 1 hour (Thursday) = 4 hours.
   Thus, the number of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday is: 4 hours (Wednesday) / 2 hours per episode = 2 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 2 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

{The final answer is 2 episodes.}</s>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.

                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We know that Henry baked twice as many cookies as he did last year, and he now has a total of 110 cookies. Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. Then, he baked 2x cookies this year.

2. From the problem, we know that Henry actually baked 15 cookies more than he intended, so the number of cookies he baked this year is 2x + 15.

3. We also know that Henry dropped 5 cookies, so the actual number of cookies he has is 2x + 15 - 5.

4. This number is equal to 110, so we have the equation: 2x +15-5 = 110.

5. Solving the equation: 2x+10 = 110, 2x = 100, x = 50.

{The final answer is: Henry baked 50 cookies last year.}</s>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                 [/INST] To find out how much a person pays for 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards, we need to calculate the cost of gas first and then apply the cashback offer.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of gas for 10 gallons.
Cost of gas = Price per gallon * Number of gallons
Cost of gas = $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons
Cost of gas = $30.00

Step 2: Apply the cashback offer.
Cashback amount = Cashback per gallon * Number of gallons
Cashback amount = $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons
Cashback amount = $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the cashback amount from the cost of gas to find the final amount.
Final amount = Cost of gas - Cashback amount
Final amount = $30.00 - $2.00
Final amount = $28.00

The final answer is that the person pays $28.00 for 10 gallons of gas after the cashback rewards.</s>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

If they both ate their entire amount, how many did they eat on average?
                 [/INST] To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice eaten on average, we first need to find out how many roll-ups they each had.

For Beatrice:
1. The width of her fruit roll-ups is 2 roll-ups.
2. The length of her fruit roll-ups is 24 rolls.
3. So, the number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice had is: Width * Length = 2 * 24 = <<2*24=48>>48 roll-ups.

For Marcell:
1. The width of his fruit roll-ups is 3 roll-ups.
2. The length of his fruit roll-ups is 14 rolls.
3. So, the number of fruit roll-ups Marcell had is: Width * Length = 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 roll-ups.

Now, to find out the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate:
1. Add the number of fruit roll-ups both ate: 48 (for Beatrice) + 42 (for Marcell) = 90 roll-ups
2. Divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of contestants (2) to find the average number of roll-ups each ate: 90 / 2 = 45 roll-ups

                    Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she : was out on the lake. The boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back towards shore. It took her sixteen seconds , to row twenty : feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?
                 [/INST] To find out how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to first determine how many ten-foot intervals it takes for her to row to shore, and then use that information to calculate how much water was taken on in each interval.

1. We know that it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so her rowing speed is 20 feet per 16 seconds, or 1.25 feet per second.

2. The problem states that ""it took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet,"" which is redundant information since we already used it to determine her rowing speed. We can use this information to find out how long it takes for her to row one ten-foot interval. Since there are 10 feet in a ten-foot interval, we can find the time it takes to row one ten-foot interval by dividing the given time (16 seconds) by the number of ten-foot intervals in 20 feet (2).

3. Time per ten-foot interval = Total time / Number of ten-foot intervals
= 16 seconds / 2
= 8 seconds

4. Now we can use the given information that the boat is taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet, to calculate how much water is taken on in one ten-foot interval. We know that 1 liter equals 1000 cubic centimeters and 1 gallon equals 3785.41 cubic centimeters, so 1 liter equals 3.785 liters. Since there are 1000 cubic centimeters in a liter, 2 liters is equal to 2000 cubic centimeters.

5. To find the volume of water taken on in one ten-foot interval, we can multiply the volume of water taken on per ten feet by the length of a ten-foot interval:
Water volume per ten feet = 2 L / 10 ft = 0.2 L/ft
Water volume in one ten-foot interval = 0.2 L/ft * 10 ft = 2 L

6. Since 2 L = 2000 cubic centimeters, the amount of water taken on in one ten-foot interval in cubic centimeters is 2000 cubic centimeters.

7. We also know that the length of the shore is away from her, so to reach the shore she will row x ten-foot intervals. In terms of time, it takes 8 seconds to row each ten-foot interval, so the total time taken to reach shore will be 8s * x.

8. We're given that it took 64 seconds for Julia to reach shore, so we can find the number of ten-foot intervals she rowed by dividing the total time to reach shore by the time it takes to row one ten-foot interval: x = 64s / 8s = 8 ten-foot intervals

9. To calculate the total amount of water taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we can multiply the volume of water taken on in one ten-foot interval by the number of ten-foot intervals: Final answer = 2 L/ft * 8 ten-foot intervals = 16 L.

{The final answer is: Julia's boat took on 16 liters of water by the time she reached shore.}</s>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

Let's denote the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as B and the number of photographs in Jamal's photograph of ducks as D.

From the problem, we have:

B = D * 50 / 6

Step 2: We are also given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. So, we can set up an equation using Jamal's phone capacity:

Jamal's phone = D

Step 3: Now, we need to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. According to the problem, each photograph on Jamal's phone represents a single duck. So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is equal to the number of photographs on Jamal's phone:

D = 1800

Step 4: We now have the value of D (number of ducks). Let's find the value of B (number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold). We can substitute D into the equation from Step 1:

B = D * 50 / 6
B = 1800 * 50 / 6
B = 1800 * 8.3333 (rounded up to find the nearest whole number)
B ≈ 15066.67
B ≈ 15067 (rounding up)

So, Brittany's phone can hold approximately 15,067 photographs.

{The final answer is: There are 1800 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, and Brittany's phone can hold approximately 15,067 photographs.}</s>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio : of 7:13. If . she used a total of 120 teaspoons of . sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of ! teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.
                 [/INST] To find the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, we first need to determine how many teaspoons of sugar are in the ratio of 7:13.

Let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as S and the number of cups of water as W. According to the problem, the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which can also be written as 7S = 13W.

We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar, so S = 120. We can now solve for W by using the ratio:

7S = 7(120) = 840
W = 13W/7 = 13(840)/7 ≈ 1158.21

However, since we're dealing with the amount of water in cups, the value of 1158.21 is not practical. It's likely that there was a mistake in the problem statement, and water should have been given in teaspoons as well. Therefore, the given ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water is not valid in this context.

{The final answer cannot be determined from the given problem statement due to an incomplete or erroneous ratio.}

To illustrate this problem more clearly, the following table shows the relationship between teaspoons and cups for different liquid volumes:

| Volume in Teaspoons  | Volume in Cups         |
|:------------------:|:--------------------:|
|            1        |           0.125        |
|            3        |           0.25         |
|            6        |           0.5          |
|           12        |            1          |

Using these conversions, we can re-analyze the problem by determining how much water (in teaspoons) Katy used for a given amount of sugar (120 teaspoons).

Using a 7:13 ratio (7 parts sugar to 13 parts water) for 120 teaspoons of sugar:

120 parts sugar = (120 parts sugar) × (7 parts water/13 parts total) = 66.67 parts water

To find the actual number of teaspoons, we need to convert this water volume back to teaspoons:

66.67 parts water = 66.67 × (1 part water/0.125 parts water in a cup) ≈ 525.27 cups water

Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a cup, we'll round to the nearest whole number:

Rounded water volume = 525 cups

To find the total number of teaspoons, multiply this value by the number of teaspoons in a cup:

Total number of teaspoons = 525 cups × 8 teaspoons per cup = 4192 teaspoons

But Katy used only 120 teaspoons of sugar. Since the above calculation seems incorrect, the given ratio of 7:13 for sugar to water is not consistent in this problem.

{The final answer cannot be determined from the given problem statement due to an incomplete or erroneous ratio.}</s>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

Calculate the number of containers that were . imported on the second day, assuming all the containers contain 5 vehicles.
                 [/INST] Let's call the number of containers imported on the first day x. According to the problem, x containers contain 5 vehicles each, so the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is 5x.

On the second day, an additional number of containers y is imported, and since each container holds 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 5x + 5y.

We're told that the total number of vehicles is 30, so we can write an equation:

5x + 5y = 30

Now, to find the number of containers y that were imported on the second day, we need to solve this equation. Let's start by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x + y = 6

This equation alone cannot yield a unique solution since x and y are both unknowns. However, we can use some reasoning to determine if the number of containers imported on the second day is reasonable or not based on the information given.

For example, let's try to find possible integer values for x and y that would satisfy the condition. Since all containers hold at least 5 vehicles, it is unlikely that only one container was imported on the second day. This would mean x = 2 and y = 3. However, there could be other possibilities such as x = 1 and y = 6.

Inspecting the provided information, it seems more likely that there were at least a few containers imported on the second day since a large number of vehicles was added to the port. Given our initial assumption that all containers had 5 vehicles inside, the smallest possible number of containers that could have been imported on the second day to have a total of 30 vehicles is 6 containers (assuming x = 2 and y = 6).

Based on the problem description and the suggested calculation, this value seems the most probable solution. However, it's important to note that the provided information might not be sufficient to determine the exact number of containers imported on the second day. Further investigation or additional context might be needed to arrive at a definitive answer.

Given the problem description and the limited information provided, the most reasonable assumption is:

The final answer is {6 containers were imported on the second day}.

However, it's important to acknowledge that this answer may not be definitively correct, as further investigation or additional context may yield different results.</s>","On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,

                    question:
                    Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two ! were receiving four years later?
                 [/INST] To find the total salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we need to find the increase in Adrien's salary first and then use that information to find Lylah's salary since we know that their salaries increased simultaneously.

Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as X.

According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so:

Adrien's salary = X + 0.3 * X = 1.3 * X

Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40%, so:

Adrien's salary four years later = 1.4 * Adrien's salary (four years ago)

Substituting Adrien's salary from the first equation into the second equation:

1.4 * (1.3 * X) = Adrien's salary four years later

To find Lylah's salary four years later, since their salaries increased simultaneously, we know that:

Lylah's salary four years later = X + 4 * 0.04 * X = X + 0.16X = 1.16X

Now we have two equations:

1.4 * (1.3 * X) = Adrien's salary four years later
1.16X = Lylah's salary four years later

To find the relationship between Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later, we can set the two equations equal:

1.4 * (1.3 * X) = 1.16X

Dividing both sides by X:

1.4 * 1.3 = 1.16
1.712 = 1.16

Now we can find the ratio between their salaries:

Adrien's salary four years later : Lylah's salary four years later = 1.712 : 1

To find the actual values:

Let's assume that Adrien's salary four years ago was $30,000 (three times Lylah's, as mentioned in the problem that Adrien's was 30% higher than Lylah's). Then:

Adrien's salary four years ago = $30,000
Lylah's salary four years ago = $10,000 (since Adrien's was three times Lylah's)

Using the ratio from above:

Adrien's salary four years later : Lylah's salary four years later = 1.712 : 1
Adrien's salary four years later = 1.712 * $30,000 = $51,360
Lylah's salary four years later = $10,000

So, the final answer is that Adrien was earning $51,360, and Lylah was earning $10,000 four years later.</s>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.
The total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200

Step 2: Each pad has 30 sheets of paper.

Step 3: To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses per week, we multiply the number of pads he uses per week by the number of sheets on each pad:

Sheets per week = Pads per week * Sheets per pad

Step 4: To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses per month, we need to multiply the number of sheets he uses per week by the number of weeks in a month. We know there are 4 weeks in a month on average, but to be more precise, there are 4.33 weeks in a month (assuming every month has 30 or 31 days).

Sheets per month = Sheets per week * Weeks per month

2. Kael brought twice the amount of apples Morisette brought but half the number of oranges. So, the number of apples Kael brought is: 5 apples * 2 = 10 apples. The number of oranges Kael brought is: 8 oranges * 0.5 = 4 oranges. So, the number of fruits Kael brought is: 10 apples * 1 unit/apple + 4 oranges * 1 unit/orange = 14 fruits.
3. The total number of fruits they brought is: 13 fruits (Morisette) + 14 fruits (Kael) = <|13+14|>27 fruits.

An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. Dillon ! is sent to the store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 , peppers, and 10 oranges. What's the total amount of money he will spend if each pepper costs 15$?
                 [/INST] To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend at the store, we first need to find the cost of each watermelon, pepper, and orange.

1. We know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs: Let's represent the cost of a pepper as 'p'. So, the cost of a watermelon is 3p.
2. An orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs: So, the cost of an orange is 3p - 5.

Now let's find out how much Dillon will spend on each type of item:

1. Watermelons: He buys 4 watermelons. So, the cost of watermelons = 4 * (3p) = 12p
2. Peppers: He buys 20 peppers. So, the cost of peppers = 20 * p
3. Oranges: He buys 10 oranges. So, the cost of oranges = 10 * (3p - 5)

To find the total amount of money, we add the costs of watermelons, peppers, and oranges:

Total amount of money = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges
= 12p + 20p + 10(3p - 5)

Simplifying the expression:

Total amount of money = 12p + 20p + 10(3p - 5)
= 12p + 20p + 10 * 3p - 10 * 5
= 12p + 20p + 3p*10 - 5 * 10
= 32p - 10

Substituting p = $15 (given), we get:

The total amount of money = 32 * $15 - 10
= $520

{The final answer is $520.}</s>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

500 patients * 24 minutes per patient = 12000 minutes of patient time per day

Step 2: Convert the minutes to hours, since the hospital charges and doctors are paid by the hour.
12000 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 200 hours per day

Step 3: Calculate the revenue generated from the hospital's hourly rate.
200 hours per day * $150 per hour (doctors' rate) = $30,000 per day

Step 4: Calculate the revenue generated from patients' hourly rate.
200 hours per day * $200 per hour (patients' rate) = $40,000 per day

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the revenues to find the profit.

Step 2: A third of the elves quit after being vomited on by children. To find out how many elves this represents, we need to calculate one third of 60.

Step 3: One third of 60 is 20. So, 20 elves quit after being vomited on.

Step 4: After this, 10 elves quit after being kicked in the shins by kids.

Step 5: To find out the number of elves left, we need to subtract the number of elves that quit due to vomit and shin kicks from the initial number.

Step 6: Subtracting from the initial number of 60 seasonal elves, we have:

Final calculation: 60 - 20 (vomit) - 10 (shins) = 40

{The final answer is:} 40 seasonal elves are left.</s>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of tickets used for the roller coaster rides.
Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and each ride cost 6 tickets. So, the number of tickets used by Pam for roller coaster rides is 2 × 6 = 12 tickets.
Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times and each ride cost 6 tickets. So, the number of tickets used by Fred for roller coaster rides is 4 × 6 = 24 tickets.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets used for the luge rides.
Both Pam and Fred rode the luge 2 times each, and each ride cost 6 tickets. So, the number of tickets used by Pam for luge rides is 2 × 6 = 12 tickets.
The number of tickets used by Fred for luge rides is also 2 × 6 = 12 tickets.

Step 3: Find the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred.
The number of tickets used by Pam is the number of tickets used for roller coaster rides + number of tickets used for luge rides = 12 + 12 = 24 tickets.
The number of tickets used by Fred is 24 tickets as well (since he used 2 more tickets for roller coaster rides than Pam).

The final answer is: Pam and Fred used 24×2 = 48 tickets that day.</s>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.

The total mileage from Monday through Wednesday is given as 41 miles. So, we have the equation:

Total Miles = Miles on Monday + Miles on Tuesday + Miles on Wednesday
41 = 4 + 24 + Miles on Wednesday
41 = 28 + Miles on Wednesday
Miles on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Miles on Wednesday = 13

Therefore, the final answer is that Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.</s>","Walt’s Tuesday walk was 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles.

The problem states that Tom gets 4 cars and washes one of them every month. Each car wash costs $15. We need to find out how much Tom pays in a year.

Step 2: Determine the number of car washes in a year
Since Tom washes one car every month, he washes each car 12 times in a year (1 car * 12 months). But since Tom has 4 cars, the total number of car washes in a year is:

Total car washes in a year = Number of cars * Car washes per car in a year
Total car washes in a year = 4 * 12
Total car washes in a year = 48

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of car washes in a year
We know that each car wash costs $15. So, the total cost of car washes in a year is:

Total cost = Number of car washes in a year * Cost per car wash
Total cost = 48 * $15
Total cost = $720

{The final answer is: Tom pays $720 in a year for washing all his cars.}</s>","He gets 4*12=<<4*12=48>>48 car washes a year

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Bobby has 5 fewer video games than 3 times the number of video games Brian has. Mathematically, we can express this as:

Bobby's number of video games = 3 * Brian's number of video games - 5

Step 2: We're given that Brian has 20 video games, but the information about the missing games is incorrect. So, let's assume the correct initial number of video games Brian had before the comparison was made. That's what we need to find.

Let's denote that initial number as X. So, Brian's number of video games after losing 5 is 20.

Step 3: Since Brian had X video games, we can find Bobby's video games count using the given formula:

Bobby's number of video games = 3 * Brian's number of video games (which is X) - 5

Step 4: Substitute X in place of Brian's number of video games:

Bobby's number of video games = 3 * X - 5

Step 5: We need to find a value of X that satisfies the given condition (Brian had 20 after losing 5). We know that initially, Brian had X. After losing 5, he had 15 (20-5). So, X should be equal to 20 + 5 = 25.

Step 6: Now that we've determined that X is 25, we can calculate Bobby's number of video games:

Bobby's number of video games = 3 * 25 - 5
Bobby's number of video games = 75 - 5
Bobby's number of video games = 70

So the final answer is: Bobby has 70 video games.</s>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

Time = Number of questions / Questions per hour
Time for first test = 75 questions / 5 questions per hour = 15 hours

Step 2: Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, we need to find out how many questions he could have completed within that time.
Questions for first test = Hours for first test * Questions per hour
Questions for first test = 8 hours * 5 questions per hour = 40 questions

                 [/INST] To find the number of semi-automatic cars, we first need to determine how many cars are of each type (automatic and manual) and then subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars to get the number of semi-automatic cars.

1. We are given that there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars, making a total of 12 + 4 = <ins>16</ins> cars of known types.
2. The total number of cars is 20, so the number of cars that are semi-automatic is 20 - 16 = <ins>4</ins>.
3. To find the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply the result by 100%, i.e., (4 / 20) * 100%.
4. Performing the division yields 0.2 * 100 = <ins>20%</ins>.

{The final answer is: 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.}</s>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.
Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 x 100% = 20%.

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day.
2. If he worked instead, he would spend those 2 hours working.
3. So, in one week, which has 7 days, Jordan would work for: 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week
4. He earns $10 an hour, so his weekly earnings would be: 14 hours/week * $10/hour = $140/week.

He calculates that his total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit, in dollars, will Lucas make each week?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of clients, both current and potential, that Kim expects to have each week.
Total number of clients = Current clients + Potential clients
Total number of clients = 3 + 5
Total number of clients = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles of bleach and packs of cloths that will be needed each week.
Since each client’s home requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths, the weekly requirement for each client is 2 bottles + 1 pack = 3 items.

Total number of items required per week = Total number of clients * Items required per client
Total number of items required per week = 8 * 3
Total number of items required per week = 24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of bleach and cloths required each week.
Cost of bleach = Number of bottles of bleach required * Cost per bottle
Cost of bleach = 24 * $2
Cost of bleach = $48

Cost of cloths = Number of packs of cloths required * Cost per pack
Cost of cloths = 24 * $5
Cost of cloths = $120

Step 4: Calculate the total expenses each week.
Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths
Total expenses = $48 + $120
Total expenses = $168

Step 5: Calculate the total income each week.
Total income = $92 (as mentioned in the question)

Step 6: Calculate the weekly profit.
Profit = Total income - Total expenses
Profit = $92 - $168
Profit = -$76

However, a negative profit indicates a loss, which doesn't make sense given that Kim is running a business. There seems to be a mistake in the given information, as $92 is not enough to cover the expenses. We can't determine the exact profit with the information provided. {The final answer is, we cannot determine the weekly profit from the given information.}</s>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

Step 2: Determine how many times John can harvest pineapples in a year.
Since he harvests every 3 months:
Number of harvests per year = Years per harvest cycle * Number of harvests per year
= 1 year * 4 quarters (since there are 4 quarters in a year) * 3 monthly harvests
= 12 harvests

Step 3: Calculate how many pineapples John can harvest in a year.
Number of pineapples harvested per year = Number of pineapples on the field * Number of harvests per year

1. Johnny dumped a Lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor. So, he has 500 pieces from this set.
2. The next box had 3 times more pieces than the first one, which means it had 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
3. The third box had 1/4 the number of pieces compared to the second box. So, it had 1/4 * 1500 = 375 pieces.

Therefore, the total number of blocks Johnny has to pick up is:
500 (from the first box) + 1500 (from the second box) + 375 (from the third box) = 2375 blocks

4. Every bee that left before the last 6 hours and hadn't already returned came back in the final 6 hours. Since 30 bees left in the first 6 hours, and 15 had already returned, that means 15 bees returned in the final 6 hours to make up for the ones that left and hadn't yet returned.

So, the total number of bees Debra saw return in the last 6 hours of the day is the number that had left before that and hadn't already returned, which is 15 bees.

First, solve for x in terms of b:

3x + 12 = 3x + 3b
12 = 3b
b = 12/3 = 4

Now substitute the value of b back into the equation for x:

3x + 12 = 3x + 12 \* 3

For Steve, the distance is 3 miles, and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. We need to convert miles to feet for a consistent unit: 1 mile = 5280 feet. So:

Time (Steve) = Distance / Speed
Time (Steve) = 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute

Calculating this, we get:

Time (Steve) = 11.8 minutes

Similarly, for Tim:

Distance (Tim) = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet
Time (Tim) = Distance / Speed
Time (Tim) = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute

Calculating this, we get:

Time (Tim) = 39.5 minutes

The winner is Steve, who takes 11.8 minutes to get home, so the loser Tim would take 11.8 minutes more to finish:

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Cost of one cookie = $0.10
Total cost = Number of cookies * Cost of one cookie
= 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie
= $6

Step 3: Since Carl paid with a $10 bill, we need to find out how much change he received.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Dave ate fourteen french fries.
2. A seagull stole some fries, leaving behind half of what Dave ate. So, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 x 2 = 14 fries. Thus, Dave had 14 + 14 = 28 fries left.
3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries. So, they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries in total, leaving Dave with 28 - 9 = 19 fries.
4. A raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, leaving Dave with 19 / 3 = 6 2/3 fries.
5. Ants carried off one fry, leaving Dave with 6 2/3 - 1 = 5 1/3 fries.

To find the original number of fries, we need to figure out how many fries Dave had after the seagull stole the pack. Since he ate fourteen and the seagull also ate fourteen, he had 14 * 2 = 28 fries after the seagull.

The problem then describes several events that decreased the number of fries, but without stating the initial number of fries, it's impossible to find an exact number.

Therefore, {The final answer is not provided in the given problem}.</s>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Total cost = €1323

Now we need to subtract this amount from Elvira's budget of €1500 to find out how much money she has left for her clothing:

Remaining budget for clothing = Budget (€1500) - Total cost (€1323)

1. To make one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs.

2. Each time Sandra babysits, her neighbor gives her a basket with 9 eggs.

3. To determine how many babysitting sessions Sandra needs to have in order to make 15 Spanish flans, we need to figure out how many flans she can make with the eggs her neighbor gives her each time.

4. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one flan.

5. Therefore, her neighbor gives her enough eggs for 3 flans each time (9 eggs = 3 flans * 3 eggs/flan).

6. To find out how many babysitting sessions she needs to have to make 15 Spanish flans, we divide the total number of Spanish flans she needs to make by the number of flans she can make with the eggs given to her during one babysitting session:

                 [/INST] Let's denote Brooke's current age as X. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, his current age is 2X.

In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 2X (Seth's age) + X (Brooke's age) + 2 (for 2 years) = 2X + X + 2.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years is 28, so we have the equation 2X + X + 2 = 28.

Combining like terms, we get 3X + 2 = 28.

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have 3X = 26.

Finally, to find Brooke's age (X), we divide both sides by 3: X = 26/3 = 8.67, but since ages are in whole numbers, we round up and consider Brooke's age to be 9.

Now, let's find Seth's age: Seth's age = 2(Brooke's age) = 2(9) = 18.

{The final answer is Seth is 18 years old}.</s>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.

1) Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so her age is x + 3.
2) Sally Four is two times as old as Granny Red, so her age is 2x.
3) Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old. So we have 2x = 8.

Now we will find the value of x by solving the third equation:

Student loans: $300
Credit card: $200
Mortgage: $500

Step 2: Find the total minimum monthly payments.
Total minimum payments = Student loans + Credit card + Mortgage
Total minimum payments = $300 + $200 + $500
Total minimum payments = $1000

Step 3: Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find how much she pays in a month, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payments.
50% of total minimum payments = $1000 * 0.5
50% of total minimum payments = $500
So, she pays an additional $500 per month.

Let's find out the time it takes to peel and cut one potato first. It takes about 1 minute and 15 seconds (1 minute and a half) to peel a potato, and it only takes 5 seconds to cut it up. So, the time it takes to peel and cut one potato is 1 minute and 15 seconds + 5 seconds = <<1.5*60+5=121>>121 seconds.

Since all the potatoes take the same amount of time to peel and cut, we can use the time it takes to peel and cut one potato to find out how long it will take for all 60 potatoes. We know that it takes 121 seconds to peel and cut one potato, so to peel and cut 60 potatoes, it will take 121 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = <<121*60=7260>>7,260 seconds.

Now let's convert seconds to minutes: 7,260 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = <<7260/60=121>>121 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Billy about 121 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes for the family reunion and barbecue. {The final answer is: It will take Billy approximately 121 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.}</s>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.

To keep Sandra's business, ? how many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 pm?
                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many red roses Sandra originally ordered. We know that she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's denote the number of white carnations as WC.

Red roses = 4 * WC

Also, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Pink calla lilies = 5 * WC

Now, let's find the relationship between the number of white carnations and red roses.

1 carnation = x number of red roses

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can write:

1 carnation = \frac{1}{4} * Red roses

Solving for Red roses, we get:

Red roses = 4 * Carnations

Now, using the given information that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, we can write:

200 = 5 * WC

WC = 40

Now, we know that Sandra ordered 4 * WC red roses, so:

Red roses = 4 * 40
Red roses = 160

However, the problem states that Sandra has threatened to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 pm, implying that some red roses have already been delivered by Fred. To find out how many red roses still need to be delivered, we need more information.

Without this information, it's not possible to determine the exact number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm.

{The final answer is: We cannot determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm without more information.}</s>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

                 [/INST] Let's denote Mark's age as M and Jan's age as J. According to the problem, we have:

1. J = 30
2. M = J - 2
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.

So, let's calculate the age of Mark two years ago:

Mark's age two years ago = M - 2
Mark's age two years ago = (J - 2) - 2
Mark's age two years ago = J - 4

Now we know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so we can write an equation as:

(J - 4) = 5 + (J/2)

To solve this equation, first, let's get all the 'J' on one side:

J - 4 = 5 + J/2

Now, subtract J from both sides:

-J + 4 = 5 + J/2

Next, subtract 5 from both sides:

-J + 4 - 5 = J/2

Now, let's isolate J:

-J = 4 - J/2

Multiply both sides by -1:

J = 4 + J/2

Subtract J from both sides:

-J = 4 - J/2

Multiply both sides by -2:

2J = -8 + 2J/2

Divide both sides by 1:

2J = -8 + J

Subtract J from both sides:

J = -8

Now, we have a negative value for J, which doesn't make sense, since ages cannot be negative. This means there's an inconsistency or a mistake in the given information, and we cannot find a valid answer for Jean's age.

{The final answer is: There's an inconsistency or a mistake in the problem information and no valid answer for Jean's age.}</s>","2 years ago Jan was 30-2=<<30-2=28>>28 years old

                    Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track.

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?
                 [/INST] To determine how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time it takes each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.

First, let's find the time it takes for each runner on the well-rounded team to complete their leg:
 Each runner runs in 55 seconds.

Since there are 4 runners in a relay team, the total time for the well-rounded team to complete one lap is:
 Total time for well-rounded team = 4 runners * 55 seconds/runner
 Total time for well-rounded team = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds

Now, let's find the time it takes for each runner on the less well-rounded team to complete their leg. We know the first runner takes 60 seconds, and subsequent runners run 3 seconds faster than the previous runner:

First runner: 60 seconds
Second runner: 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
Third runner: 63 + 3 = 66 seconds
Fourth runner: 66 + 3 = 69 seconds

The total time for the less well-rounded team to complete one lap is:
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 runners * time for one runner
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 * (60 + (3 * (3 + 1)))
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 * (60 + 3 * 4)
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 * (60 + 12)
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 4 * 72
 Total time for less well-rounded team = 288 seconds

Finally, to find the difference in the time the teams take to complete the relay, subtract the total time for the less well-rounded team from the total time for the well-rounded team:

Time difference = Total time for well-rounded team - Total time for less well-rounded team
 Time difference = 220 seconds - 288 seconds
 Time difference = -68 seconds

However, since a negative time difference means that the less well-rounded team actually finishes before the well-rounded team, we made an error in our calculations. To correct this, we should find the absolute value of the time difference:

|Time difference| = |220 seconds - 288 seconds| = |-(288-220)| = |-(-168)| = 168 seconds

{The final answer is that the well-rounded team wins by 168 seconds.}</s>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                 [/INST] To find the answer to this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row, and then find the difference between these probabilities as a percentage.

First, let's find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 in a single roll. There are 3 even numbers (1, 2, 3) and 3 odd numbers (4, 5, 6) on a six-sided die, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

P(number greater than 3) = Number of outcomes greater than 3 / Total number of outcomes
= 3 (odd numbers) / 6 (total outcomes)
= 1/2

Next, let's find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The probability of rolling an even number in a single roll is 1/2, so the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

P(two even numbers) = P(even number) * P(even number)
= 1/2 * 1/2
= 1/4

Now, we can find the difference between these probabilities as a percentage:

Difference = |P(number greater than 3) - P(two even numbers) | * 100%
= |(1/2) - (1/4) | * 100%
= |(2 - 1) / 2 | * 100%
= |1/2 | * 100%
= 50%

So, Jerry is 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. {The final answer is: Jerry is 50% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.}</s>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

                    Russell works at a pet store and is distributing straw among the rodents. The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw. : There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.

If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many pieces of straw have been given to the rats and hamsters. let's calculate that:

1. For the rats: 3 cages * number of rats per cage * pieces of straw per rat = 3X * X * 6
2. For the hamsters: 10 cages * number of hamsters per cage * pieces of straw per hamster = 10Y * Y * 5

Now we know that the total amount of straw given is 160:

3. 3X * X * 6 + 10Y * Y * 5 = 160

We don't have enough information to exactly determine X and Y (the number of rats or hamsters in a cage), but we can determine if the numbers are integers that would satisfy the equation.

Let's try some trial and error:

First, let's assume that both X and Y are equal to 5 (for simplicity).
3*5*6 + 10*5*5 = 220+125 = 345. This is not equal to 160.

Let's try X = 5 and Y = 4:
3*5*6 + 10*4*5 = 150+100 = 250. This is still not equal to 160.

Since the difference between the first calculation (345) and the given amount of straw (160) is relatively large, it's unlikely that the numbers of rats or hamsters are so close to each other in terms of the number of animals in their cages.

However, since the question asks for the number of rats in each cage, we should focus on the rats' part of the calculation:

3X*6
The largest multiple of 5 less than 160 that can be formed is obtained when X=11.
3*11*6=201. That's not the exact answer, but the difference between 201 and 160 is smaller than the difference we found before: 201-160=41.

So, the numbers of rats in each cage must be close to 11 for the total straw amount to be close to 160 pieces. One possible solution could be:

X = 11
Y = 6

3*11*6 + 10*6*5 = 1212 + 1080 = 2292

The difference between this number and the given amount of straw is still larger than before (2292-160=2226), meaning that X=11 and Y=6 isn't the exact answer. But this calculation gives us a clue: The number of rats per cage should be close to 11.

Answer: Unfortunately, the problem doesn't have a definitive answer, but based on the available information, the number of rats in each cage must be close to 11. {The final answer is a number close to 11}.</s>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Mandy should pay after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest that accumulates on the initial $100 debt over those three months.

First, let's find the monthly interest. Since the interest rate is 2% per month:

Monthly interest = Initial debt * Monthly interest rate

Monthly interest = $100 * 0.02
Monthly interest = $2

Now that we know the monthly interest, we can find how much the debt grows after 3 months.

Debt after 3 months = Initial debt + (Monthly interest * Number of months)

Debt after 3 months = $100 + ($2 * 3)
Debt after 3 months = $100 + $6
Debt after 3 months = $106

{The final answer is: Mandy should pay $106 to Benedict after 3 months.}</s>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.

                 [/INST] To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the cost of each bag for the trader after buying it from the farmer. We know the trader bought the bags at $20 per bag, and it costs $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost per bag for the trader is:

Cost per bag = Buying price + Transportation cost
= $20 + $2
= $22

2. Find the selling price per bag. We know the trader made a profit of $400 by selling all the bags. Let's call the number of bags sold 'x'. The total selling price for all the bags is $400 plus the total cost of buying and transporting all the bags. That is:

Total selling price = Total cost of bags + Profit
= ($22 * x) + $400

3. Since we want to find the number of bags 'x' that the trader sold, we can set up an equation and solve for x. Let's equate the total selling price to the total cost of buying and transporting all the bags. That is:

($22 * x) + $400 = $400 + ($22 * x)

Subtracting $22 * x from both sides, we get:

$22 * x = $200

Dividing both sides by $22, we find:

x = $200 / $22
= 9.09...

Since the number of bags must be a whole number, we rounded up to 10 as the trader bought an integral number of bags from the farmer.

Therefore, the trader sold 10 bags.

{The final answer is the trader sold 10 bags.}</s>","Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)
Each bag of wheat was sold for $30 each giving a profit of $30-$22=$<<30-22=8>>8 on each bag
Since a total of $400 profit was made, the total number of bags sold is $400/$8=<<400/8=50>>50 bags

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how much the friends spent on tickets and food in total. We know they spent $20.25 on tickets, so the cost of food would be $20.25 - $20 (ticket cost for 3 friends) = $2.25.

Step 2: The problem states they spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. But if we just found out they spent $2.25 on food, we need to adjust that. $2.25 is actually $4.25 less than they spent on tickets. So their total spending is $20.25 (tickets) + $4.25 (food) = $24.50.

Step 3: They also paid $33 for 2 rides. That's a total of $66 for all 3 friends. However, we need to find out how much each person paid. Since there are 3 friends and they split all the costs evenly, each friend paid a fraction of the total cost equal to 1/3.

Step 4: To find out how much each friend paid, we divide the total cost ($24.50 + $66) by the number of friends (3). We first add the total cost ($24.50 + $66) which equals $80.50. Then, we divide by 3: $80.50 ÷ 3 = $26.83. This is not an answer we can accept, since it's not equal to the given costs for tickets and rides.

There seems to be a mistake in the problem. The costs for tickets are stated multiple times, and the cost for two rides is included in the spending on tickets ($20.25 + $33 = $53.50) which contradicts the information given that they paid $4.50 less for food than for tickets. If the problem is meant to be solved, the information about the food costs needs to be checked and corrected.

{The final answer cannot be determined with the given information, as there seems to be a mistake or inconsistency in the problem.}</s>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

Step 3: So, 3 hours = 3 * 60 = 180 minutes

Step 4: Since John collects 2 peaches per minute, the total number of peaches he collects is:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of trees Tom plants and chop down each year.
Tom plants 10 trees a year and chops down 2 trees a year. So the net growth is 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.

Step 2: Find out how many trees Tom will have after 10 years of planting and chopping down trees.
Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years of planting 8 trees and losing 2 trees (chopping down), we have:
50 trees (initial) + 8 trees/year * 10 years - 2 trees/year * 10 years = 62 trees

Step 3: Calculate the number of trees that die due to natural causes after 10 years.
30% of the 62 trees die. So,
0.3 * 62 = 18.6 ≈ 19 trees die.

Step 4: Subtract the number of died trees from the number of trees Tom has.
Therefore, the total number of trees Tom has left = 62 trees (remaining after 10 years of planting and chopping down) - 19 trees (died due to natural causes) = 43 trees.

1. On Friday morning, 18 pink plastic flamingos were placed in Sue's front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, one-third of the flamingos were taken away, painted white, and put back out. So, 1/3 of 18 = 6 pink flamingos were taken away and replaced with white ones. This leaves us with 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remaining.
3. On Sunday morning, an additional 18 pink plastic flamingos were added to the collection.
4. Therefore, at noon on Sunday, the number of pink plastic flamingos is 12 (remaining from Saturday) + 18 (added on Sunday) = 30.
5. The number of white plastic flamingos is the same as the number of pink flamingos on Saturday, which was 12.
6. To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white ones, we need to subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 (pink flamingos) - 12 (white flamingos) = 18.

Step 2: In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards, so she collected 20 - 20 = 0 cards less than in the first month. However, since she collected fewer cards, we need to subtract the difference from the total number of cards she had to find the number of cards she collected in the second month. So, the number of cards she collected in the second month is 20 - (20 - x), where x is the number of cards she collected in excess in the first month and thus also in the third month.

Step 3: In the third month, she collected twice the number of cards she collected in the first two months. So, she collected 2 * (20 + x).

Step 4: The total number of cards Elaine has now is the sum of the number of cards she collected in each month: 20 (first month) + (20 - x) (second month) + 2 * (20 + x) (third month).

Step 5: Rearranging the equation from step 4, we get x = (20 + 2 * (20 + x) - 20) / 2. Solving this equation gives us x = 60.

Step 6: Substituting x = 60 back into the equation from step 4, we get the final answer: 20 + (20 - 60) + 2 * (20 + 60) = -10 + 120 = 110.

                    ; Mark is a copy-editor. He edits an equal number , of sentences each week for two different publishers, who each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A : pays him : 5 cents per sentence. ; How ? much does Mark make in a week, in cents?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of sentences Mark edits for Publisher A as ""x,"" and the number of sentences he edits for Publisher B as ""y.""

According to the problem, Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, so:

x + y = 1000 (1)

Also, the problem states that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays per sentence, so:

5c × y = 2 × 5c × x (2)

Now, we can solve for one variable in equation (1), and then use that value to find the other variable in equation (2). Let's solve for x:

x = 1000 - y

Now we can substitute ""1000 - y"" for x in equation (2):

5c × y = 2 × 5c × (1000 - y)

To simplify the equation, let's factor out ""5c×y"":

5c×y = 5c×2 × 1000 - 5c×2 × y

Distribute the ""2"" term on the right side of the equation:

5c×y = 10×5c×1000 - 5c×2 × y

Split the right side into two terms:

5c×y = 10×5c×1000 - 5c×2 × y
5c×y = 50000c - 10c×y

To solve for y, we can set the equation equal to zero and use the quadratic formula or other methods, but since the coefficients are all integers, we can use trial and error to find integer solutions. One possible value for y is 400, as 1000 - 400 = 600, and 2 × 600 = 1200, which is an even number of sentences that Mark could edit for Publisher B while still meeting the condition of having an equal number of sentences edited for each publisher.

Checking our value of y by substituting it back into equation (1):

x + y = 1000
x + 400 = 1000
x = 600

Now we have x = 600 and y = 400. We can use these values to find Mark's total earnings for the week:

Total earnings = 5c × x + 5c × y
Total earnings = 5c × 600 + 5c × 400
Total earnings = 3000c + 2000c
Total earnings = 5000c

{The final answer is: Mark makes 5000 cents (or 50 dollars) in a week.}</s>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Baldur gets in the afternoon.
Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
So, Baldur gets 6 pails × 5 liters/pail = 30 liters of water in the afternoon.

1. First, let's calculate the one-time bonus: $5000

2. Next, let's calculate the new weekly salary with the 5% raise. A 5% raise on a weekly salary of $2000 is a $100 increase per week: $2000 + $100 = $2100/week

3. Now, to find out how much John made in a year, we need to multiply his new weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year: $2100/week * 52 weeks = $1,104,000

                 [/INST] To find out how many barrels of wine Josie's 10-acre farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many tons of grapes are produced each year on one acre. We know that each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.
2. Find out how many tons of grapes are produced annually on 10 acres.
3. Multiply the number of tons of grapes produced in one year by the number of barrels of wine one ton can make.

Let's work through the steps:

Step 1: For each acre, 5 tons of grapes are produced, and each ton produces 2 barrels of wine. So, one acre produces 5 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 10 barrels (5 tons * 2 barrels) of wine per year.

Step 2: On 10 acres, the total amount of grapes produced is 10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons.

Step 3: To find the number of barrels of wine produced in a year from 50 tons of grapes, we multiply the number of tons by the number of barrels produced per ton: 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels.

{The final answer is: Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.}</s>","If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for sandwiches.
Since Carl used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich and he had a sandwich every day for lunch this week, we need to find out how many days there are in a week to calculate the total number of slices he used for sandwiches.

We know that there are 7 days in a week, so:

Slices of cheese for sandwiches = Number of sandwiches * Slices of cheese per sandwich
= 7 sandwiches * 2 slices of cheese
= 14 slices of cheese

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for omelets.
Carl had an omelette for breakfast 3 days in a week, and he used one more slice of cheese per omelette than he did per sandwich. So, he used 3 slices of cheese for each omelette.

Slices of cheese for omelettes = Number of omelettes * Slices of cheese per omelette
= 3 omelettes * 3 slices of cheese
= 9 slices of cheese

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices of cheese Carl used for macaroni and cheese.
Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners for the week, and he used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese = Slices of cheese per dish
= 8 slices of cheese

Step 4: Calculate the total number of slices of cheese Carl used during the week.
Total slices of cheese = Slices of cheese for sandwiches + Slices of cheese for omelettes + Slices of cheese for macaroni and cheese
= 14 slices + 9 slices + 8 slices

{The final answer is: Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese during the week.}</s>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.

                    question:
                    Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests , each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?
                 [/INST] To find the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first need to calculate her current semester average without removing the lowest score, then determine her current total average with the lowest score removed, and finally find the difference between the two and add that to her current total score to find the score she needs on the sixth test.

Step 1: Calculate her current semester average without removing the lowest score:
Sum of scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
Average = Total Sum / Number of Tests = 448 / 5 = 89.6

Step 2: Find her current total average with the lowest score removed:
Since we don't know the lowest score yet, we cannot directly calculate her average with one score removed. However, since her current semester average is 89.6, and she wants a new average of 93, she needs to increase her current average by 3.4 points.

Step 3: Determine the difference between her current average and the desired average:
Difference = Desired average - Current average = 93 - 89.6 = 3.4

Step 4: Find the score she needs on the sixth test to achieve the new average:
We know she has scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first 5 tests, so:
Total Sum = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
Current average = 89.6
To have a new average of 93, she needs to add 3.4 points to her total sum:
Total Sum with new average = 448 + 3.4 = 451.4

The number of tests Brinley will have after taking the sixth test is 6, so:
New semester average = Total Sum with new average / Tests taken = 451.4 / 6 ≈ 75.2

Since the average has to be a number rather than an approximation, Brinley would need to earn a score closer to 75 on the sixth test. Let's assume the minimum possible difference between her new average and the previous average, which is 0.1, and add that to her current average:
New semester average ≈ 75.3

Now, we calculate how close Brinley should be to this new average:
Total Sum with new average = 75.3 * 6 = 451.8
Score difference = Total Sum with new average - Current total sum = 451.8 - 448 = 3.8

The difference between the current average and the new semester average is 3.7 (93 - 89.6), so we need to find how close Brinley should be to a new semester average of approximately 75.3 to make the total sum difference 3.8. To do this calculation, we assume the new semester average will be exactly 75.3:

Scores for tests 1 - 5 = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448
New semester sum = 75.3 * 6 = 451.8

To find the required difference between Brinley's fifth test score (86) and the score needed on the sixth test, we can use the following calculation:
Difference = New semester sum - scores for tests 1 - 5 = 451.8 - 448 = 3.8

Since Brinley scored 86 on the fifth test, which is 3.8 less than she needs to score on the sixth test to achieve a semester average of 93. To make up for that lack of difference, she would need a score on the sixth test that is 3.8 more than her fifth test score:

Required score on test 6 = 86 + 3.8 ≈ 89.8

However, this would not be a reasonable solution, as the answer should be a whole number. Therefore, it's essential to note that based on the information provided, Brinley might not be able to achieve a semester average of 93 after taking six tests. In this situation, if the lowest test score doesn't significantly","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

Weekly distance (5 rides/week * 25 km/ride) = 125 km/week

Step 2: Next, let's find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total during the first 4 weeks.

Total distance in first 4 weeks = Weekly distance * Number of weeks

Total distance in first 4 weeks = 125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km

Step 3: Now, let's find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in one week when he was riding his bike only 2 times a week and making 60 kilometers each time.

Weekly distance (2 rides/week * 60 km/ride) = 120 km/week

Step 4: Finally, let's find out how many kilometers Micheal rode in total during the last 3 weeks.

Total distance in last 3 weeks = Weekly distance * Number of weeks

Total distance in last 3 weeks = 120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km

Step 5: To find the total distance Micheal rode in all 7 weeks, we have to sum the distances he rode during the first 4 weeks and the last 3 weeks.

Step 2: Determine the weight of each chocolate bar. We're told that each chocolate bar weighs 40g and that each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, a candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g.

Step 3: Find the weight of all the chocolate bars. There are 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40g = 1000g or 1kg.

Step 4: Find the weight of all the candied apples. There are 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20g = 1600g or 1.6kg.

Step 5: Find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. The total weight of the candy is the weight of the chocolate bars plus the weight of the candied apples, so the total weight is 1kg (chocolate) + 1.6kg (apples) = 2.6kg.

                 [/INST] Let's first determine the total cost of half a dozen plates: half a dozen = 6, so the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000.

Next, we're told that 20 dozens (20 x 12 = 240) of cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of 240 cups is $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

To find the cost of one cup, we divide the total cost of all the cups by the number of cups:

{The final answer is $20. Therefore, each cup costs $20}.</s>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

                 [/INST] To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first need to determine how much money she makes from babysitting and mowing the lawn, and how much she needs in total.

1. Sara earns $5 each time she babysits, so she earns a total of $5 x number of times she babysits.
2. Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns a total of $4 x number of times she mows the lawn.
3. Sara already had $10 saved before she started earning money, so the total amount of money Sara has is: $10 + ($5 x number of times she babysits) + ($4 x number of times she mows the lawn).
4. The cost of the jacket is $30, and the cost of each pair of shoes is $20, so the total cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes is: $30 + ($20 x 2) = $70.
5. Therefore, Sara must save up a total of $70 in order to buy the jacket and two pairs of shoes.
6. We need to find the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes. So we set up an equation:
   $10 + ($5 x number of times she babysits) + ($4 x number of times she mows the lawn) = $70
7. Solving for the number of times Sara needs to mow the lawn:
   $4 x number of times she mows the lawn = $60 (the difference between the amount of money she needs and the amount she already has)
   number of times she mows the lawn = $60 / $4 = 15

{The final answer is, Sara needs to mow the lawn 15 times to be able to afford the jacket and shoes.}</s>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

                    question:
                    Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens ! than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?
                 [/INST] To find the number of red chickens in Jerry's flock, we first need to determine how many red chickens produce 42 eggs a day. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs produced by one red chicken.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red chickens based on the total eggs collected.
- Total eggs per day = 42
- Eggs produced by one red chicken = 3

Red chickens = Total eggs per day / Eggs produced by one red chicken
- = 42 / 3
- = 14 red chickens

However, we know that he has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's call the number of white chickens ""x"".

Step 2: Use the information given that there are two more white chickens than red chickens, to find the number of white chickens.

Since there are 14 red chickens, there are 14 + 2 = 16 red chickens minus 2 red chickens = 14 red chickens in the original statement.

We also know that each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, so to find the number of white chickens ""x"" we use the following equation:

Eggs produced by red chickens + Eggs produced by white chickens = Total eggs per day
3 * number of red chickens + 5 * x = 42

Step 3: Solve the equation to find the number of white chickens ""x"".

Substituting the number of red chickens (14) into the equation:
3 * 14 + 5 * x = 42
42 + 5 * x = 42 + 42
5 * x = 0
x = 0

This result is not valid since there should be white chickens in the flock. This may indicate a mistake in the problem statement, as having an equal or fewer number of white chickens than red chickens contradicts the information given.

{An error in the problem statement prevents us from finding the final answer.}</s>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

1. Find the perimeter of the rectangle:
Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
Since the park measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles:
Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * (1.5 miles + 6 miles)
Perimeter = 2 * (7.5 miles)
Perimeter = 15 miles

2. Calculate the time it takes Gary to walk the entire perimeter:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
Time = 5 hours

{The final answer is: Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park.}</s>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

                 [/INST] To find the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to find out how many customers she counted on the second day and then add that number to the number of customers she counted on the first day.

First, let's find out how many customers Sloane counted on the second day. We know that she counted 50 more customers than on the first day, and on the first day she counted 100 customers.

So, the number of customers Sloan counted on the second day = Customers on the first day + 50
= 100 + 50
= 150

Now, we know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500. Since we already know the number of customers on the first and second days, we can find the number of customers she counted on the third day by subtracting the number of customers she counted on the first and second days from the total number of customers.

So, the number of customers Sloan counted on the third day = Total Customers - Customers on the first day - Customers on the second day
= 500 - 100 - 150
= 350

Therefore, {The final answer is: Sloan counted 350 customers on the third day.}</s>","On the second day, she counted 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 customers.

                    question:
                    Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them ? out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water ! as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the volume of water in the small pool as x. Since 4 minutes ago, the small pool had half the volume of the big pool, we have:

x_initial = 0.5 * volume_big_pool

Now, let the current volume of the small pool be x_final, and the current volume of the big pool be 4x_final (given in the problem that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool). We know that both pools leak at the same rate, so the change in volume in each pool is the same: -4 gallons/minute.

Since 4 minutes have passed since we last checked the water levels in the pools, we can write an equation for the amount of water each pool now has:

x_initial + (x_initial - 4 * 4) = x_final + (x_final - 4 * 4)
=> x_initial + x_initial - 4 * 4 = x_final + x_final - 4 * 4
=> 2 * x_initial = 3 * x_final

Since we know x_initial = 0.5 * volume_big_pool, we can substitute this value back into the equation:

2 * (0.5 * volume_big_pool) = 3 * x_final
=> x_final = \frac{2}{3} * volume_big_pool

Now we need to find the volume of the small pool in terms of the volume of the big pool. Since the problem doesn't directly provide a value for the big pool, we cannot calculate an exact numerical answer for the small pool's volume. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer cannot be determined without a known value for the volume of the big pool.}</s>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

                 [/INST] To find the remaining balance Janeth will owe after making 12 monthly payments of $165 each, we need to first determine her monthly payment amount that covers both the principal and the added 10% portion of the loan.

Step 1: Define monthly payment amount, P, in terms of the annual interest rate r and the loan amount, A:
P = A * r / (1 - (1 + r)^(-12))

Step 2: Replace the variables with their given values:
A = $2000, r = 10% = 0.1

P = $2000 * 0.1 / (1 - (1 + 0.1)^(-12))
P = $2000 * 0.1 / (1 - 0.81)
P = $2000 * 0.1 / 0.19

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment amount:
P ≈ $1121.11

Since the monthly payment amount given in the question is $165, this means there is a mistake or omission in the given information. The monthly payment amount does not align with the loan amount and the 10% added to be paid back, so it's impossible to find the remaining balance based on the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is: There is not enough information to determine the remaining balance after 12 months.</s>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote Harriet's age as H, Adrian's age as A, and Zack's age as Z. Given that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age (A = 3H) and Harriet's age is half of Zack's age (H = Z/2), we have a system of equations:

A = 3H
H = Z/2

Step 2: Since Harriet is currently 21 years old, we can substitute H in terms of Z into the first equation:

A = 3(Z/2)

Step 3: Solve for Z:

Z = 2A/3

Step 4: Now that we have Z in terms of A, we can substitute Z into the second equation to find H:

H = Z/2
H = (2A/3)/2

Step 5: Simplify H:

H = A/3

Step 6: Now that we know H and A, we can find their ages three years from now:

In three years, Adrian's age will beA + 3
Harriet's age will beH + 3 = (A + 3)/3

Step 7: We can now calculate their ages three years from now and find their average age:

Average age of Adrian and Harriet in three years = (A + 3 + (A + 3)/3)/2

Step 8: Substitute A = 3H:
A + 3 = 3(H + 1)

Step 9: Solve for H:

H + 1 = A/3 + 1
H = (A-2)/3

Step 10: Substitute H = (A + 3)/3 into the equation for H and simplify:

(A + 3)/3 = A/3
4A + 9 = 3A
A = 3

Step 11: Substitute A = 3 into the equation for H:

H = (A-2)/3 = (3-2)/3 = 1

Harriet's age is 1 year.

Step 12: Find Adrian's age:

Adrian's age = 3H = 3(1) = 3

In three years, Adrian's age will beA + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6

Step 13: Average age of Adrian and Harriet in three years:

We know that:
1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, so Yuri scored 68 + 10 = 78 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.
4. The total number of points scored by all four students is 251.

Using this information, we can set up the following system of equations:

 Naomi   = 68
 Yuri   = 78
 Brianna = 85
 Jojo + Naomi + Yuri + Brianna = 251

Next, we can solve this system of equations. Substituting the values of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the first three equations into the fourth equation, we get:

So the amount of water in the tank after Celine took out water for her garden is:
120 (initial amount of water) - 90 (water taken out) = 30 liters

Step 2: The remaining water in the tank was later increased by rainwater. The rainwater collected was twice the amount of the remaining water.
So the amount of rainwater collected is: 30 liters * 2 = 60 liters

Step 2: The number of petunias he plants is 40 fewer than the number of geraniums, so we need to find the difference between the number of geraniums and the number of petunias.

Step 3: To find the number of petunias, subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

Petunias = Geraniums - 40

Step 4: Substitute the value of geraniums (90) into the equation from step 3.

Petunias = 90 - 40

Step 5: Solve for the number of petunias.

Petunias = 50

Step 6: To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, add the number of geraniums and the number of petunias.

Total Flowers = Geraniums + Petunias

Step 7: Substitute the values of geraniums (90) and petunias (50) into the equation from step 6.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the initial number of watermelons.
Given that 120 baby watermelons were produced, so {The initial number of watermelons is 120}.

Step 2: Find out how many melons were harvested after two months.
30% of 120 watermelons were ready for harvest, so {Number of watermelons harvested after 2 months = 0.3 * 120 = 36}.

Step 3: Determine how many melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
Given that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest, we first need to find out how many melons were left after the first harvest.
Initial number of melons = 120
Number of melons harvested = 36

So, the number of melons left after the first harvest = 120 - 36 = 84.

3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest, so {Number of watermelons harvested after 2 weeks = 84 * (3/4) = 62.4. Since we cannot harvest a fraction of a watermelon, we'll round this down to 62}.

Step 4: Find out how many melons were not harvested after 2 weeks.
{Number of melons not harvested after 2 weeks = Initial number of melons - Number of melons harvested after 2 months - Number of melons harvested after 2 weeks}}
= 120 - 36 - 62
= <<120-36-62=16>>16.

However, since we cannot have fewer than zero watermelons, there must have been an error in the calculation. Let's go back to step 3.

Step 3 (fix): Find out how many melons were left after the first harvest.
Initial number of melons = 120
Number of melons harvested = 36

So, the number of melons left after the first harvest = 120 - 36 = 84.

Step 3 (fix): Determine how many melons were ready for harvest after two weeks.
Given that 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvest, {Number of melons harvested after 2 weeks = 84 * (3/4) = 62.4. Since we cannot harvest a fraction of a watermelon, we'll round this up to 63}.

Step 4: Find out how many melons were not harvested after 2 weeks.
{Number of melons not harvested after 2 weeks = Initial number of melons - Number of melons harvested after 2 months - Number of melons harvested after 2 weeks}}
= 120 - 36 - 63
= <<120-36-63=-1>>-1.

Since we cannot have a negative number of watermelons, there must have been an error in the calculation as well. One possible explanation is that after the first harvest, some melons might have been damaged or spoiled, reducing the total number of melons available for harvest. In this case, the actual number of melons not harvested after 2 weeks would depend on the number of damaged or spoiled watermelons, which was not provided in the problem statement.</s>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,

3. Registration fee for each car = $1,000

So, the total cost of each car = $20,000 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $23,000

Now, we calculate Mark's total expenditure on all 12 cars:

- He eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- Therefore, he eats 6 x 7 = 42 tomatoes per week.

Step 2: Determine the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day and per week.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- He eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- Therefore, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.
- She eats 3 x 7 = 21 tomatoes per week.

Step 3: Determine how many tomatoes one vine produces per week.
- Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 4: Determine how many vines are needed to produce the number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat per week.
- Steve eats 42 tomatoes per week.
- His girlfriend eats 21 tomatoes per week.

Total slices required = 20 friends * 4 slices
Total slices required = 80 slices

Step 2: Determine how many slices come with one pizza:
Each pizza comes sliced into 8 portions.

Step 3: Calculate how many pizzas John needs to order to provide enough slices for all friends:
Number of pizzas = Total slices required / Slices per pizza
Number of pizzas = 80 slices / 8 slices

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he bought, based on his ability to make a new pen from five empty pens.

Since Ram can make one new pen from five empty pens, he can make:

New pens = original pens used to make the new pen / number of empty pens used
New pens = 5 empty pens / 5
New pens = 1 pen

So, one original pen produces one new pen. Hence, Ram can make 25 new pens from the 25 original pens he bought.

Step 2: However, Ram still has the original 25 pens. So the total number of pens Ram has after making new pens from the ones he bought is:

Total pens = originally bought pens + pens made from them
Total pens = 25 + 25
Total pens = 50

{The final answer is: Ram ends up having a total of 50 pens.}</s>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how many students went out through exits A and B.

1. Students going out through exit A: 30% of 1000 = (0.3) * 1000 = 300
2. Students going out through exit B: 3/5 of the remaining students after exit A, so first we need to find out how many students were left after exit A, which is 1000 - 300 = 700. Now, 3/5 of 700 is: (3/5) * 700 = 420

Now, let's find out how many students went out through exit C:

Total number of students going out = Students going out through A + Students going out through B + Students remaining inside
Total number of students going out = 300 + 420 + Students remaining inside

We know that the total number of students was initially 1000, so we can find the number of students remaining inside:
1000 - Total number of students going out = Students remaining inside
1000 - (300 + 420) = 1000 - 720 = 280

So there were 280 students remaining inside the building after everyone went out through exits A and B, and no students went out through exit C, as stated in the problem. However, it's clear there was an error in the problem, as the number of students going out should total 1000, while in our solution it is 300 + 420 = 720. Thus, the problem includes incorrect data.

{The final answer, based on the given incorrect problem input, is: Students going out through exit C: 0}</s>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.

3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.

3. According to the problem, John has 54 candies.

Let's set up an equation to solve for X:

X + 6 = James' candies
2X = John's candies

Now, we can use the given information that John has 54 candies to find the value of X:

2X = 54
X = 27

Since Robert has X candies, Robert has 27 candies as well. Now that we know how many candies Robert and James have, we can find out how many more candies John has:

John's candies = 54
James' candies = X + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

1. Mike is a pen pal with 5 people. He stopped being penpals with 2 of them, so he currently corresponds with 3 people.

2. Each person sends him 2 letters a week, so Mike receives a total of 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 letters a week. Since each letter is 5 pages long, Mike receives a total of 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 pages a week.

3. Mike writes back in the same length and frequency. So, he sends out 6 letters a week, which amounts to 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 pages a week.

4. It takes Mike 1 page every 6 minutes to write a letter. So, it takes him 1 page * 6 minutes = <<1*6=6>>6 minutes to write one letter. Consequently, it takes him 6 minutes per page.

5. To find out how long it takes him to write all the letters in a week, we calculate the total number of minutes it takes to write all the pages: 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = <<30*6=180>>180 minutes.

To convert minutes into hours, we divide the total number of minutes by 60; thus, 180 minutes / 60 minutes = 3 hours.

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So we can write:

(number of snails in larger aquarium) - (number of snails in smaller aquarium) = 2 * (number of fish in both aquariums)

Let's assume the number of snails in the smaller aquarium is S (given as 4), so the number of snails in the larger aquarium is S + 32.

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

(S + 32) - 4 = 2 * x

First, let's solve for x:

x = (S + 32 - 4) / 2
x = (S + 30) / 2
x = (S + 15)

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can now find the value of x (and thus the number of fish in each aquarium) by setting the difference between the number of snails in each aquarium to zero:

S - (S + 15) = 0
S = 15

So, there are 15 snails in the smaller aquarium. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the number of fish in the larger aquarium is also x:

x = S + 30
x = 15 + 30
x = 45

The final answer is: There are 45 fish in each aquarium.</s>","The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of makeup per day without discount.
Cost of makeup per day = Charge per hour * Hours per day
Cost of makeup per day = $250/hour * 6 hours
Cost of makeup per day = $1500

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of makeup for the movie without discount.
Total cost of makeup for the movie = Cost of makeup per day * Number of days in a week * Number of weeks in the movie
Total cost of makeup for the movie = $1500/day * 7 days/week * 5 weeks
Total cost of makeup for the movie = $15,750

Step 3: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = Total cost of makeup for the movie * Discount percentage
Discount amount = $15,750 * 10%
Discount amount = $1,575

Step 4: Calculate the final cost of makeup for Jean.
Final cost of makeup for Jean = Total cost of makeup for the movie - Discount amount
Final cost of makeup for Jean = $15,750 - $1,575
Final cost of makeup for Jean = $14,175

She ; split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. How many dollars did each person pay?
                 [/INST] To find out how much each person paid, we first need to find the total amount spent by Isabelle on the party supplies. We can do this by adding up the costs of the cake, birthday presents, decorations, invitations, and goodie bags.

Total amount spent by Isabelle = $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags)

Total amount spent by Isabelle = $82

Now, Isabelle plans to split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents. So, we need to divide the total amount spent by Isabelle by the number of people paying for the party.

Cost per person = Total amount spent by Isabelle / Number of people paying
Cost per person = $82 / 3

Let's calculate the amount each person paid:

Cost per person = $82 ÷ 3
Cost per person = $27.33 (approximately)

However, since the problem states that Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, it means that each parent paid half of Isabelle's share. Therefore, each parent paid $27.33 x 0.5 = $13.67 (approximately) for the party.

{The final answer is that each parent paid approximately $13.67 for the party}.</s>","Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.

Since the chef bought 4 bags and each bag weighs 50 pounds, the total weight of the onions is:
Weight = Number of bags * Weight per bag
Weight = 4 bags * 50 pounds
Weight = 200 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the number of pounds of onions the chef bought.
From the problem, we are given that a pound of onions costs $1.50. So, the chef bought 200 pounds of onions:

Step 3: Find the total cost of the onions.
Since 1 pound costs $1.50, the cost of 200 pounds of onions is:
Cost = Weight in pounds * Cost per pound
Cost = 200 pounds * $1.50 per pound
Cost = $300

On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

On Monday, Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister, so she ate 5 cookies as well.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, Sue ate 13 cookies + 13 cookies = 26 cookies.

To find out how many calories Sue consumed and how many calories her sister consumed, we need to find the total number of calories for each person and then subtract the sister's calories from Sue's calories.

The sister's calories on Monday = 5 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories

The sister's calories on Tuesday = 13 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 2600 calories

The sister's total calories = 1000 calories + 2600 calories = 3600 calories

Sue's calories on Monday = 5 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 1000 calories

Sue's calories on Tuesday = 26 cookies × 200 calories/cookie = 5200 calories

Sue's total calories = 1000 calories + 5200 calories = 6200 calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the sister's total calories from Sue's total calories.

The difference in calories = Sue's total calories − Sister's total calories = 6200 calories − 3600 calories = 2600 calories

                 [/INST] To find out how many boys are in the third class, we first need to determine the number of students in the third class, and then subtract the number of girls in that class.

1. First, we know that there are 3 classes with 20 students each. So, the total number of students in the school is: 3 classes * 20 students/class = <<3*20=60>>60 students.

2. We also know that 50% of the students are boys and 50% are girls. So, there are: 60 students * 0.5 = <<60*0.5=30>>30 boys in the school.

3. We are told that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is: 15 girls (Class 1) + 12 girls (Class 2) = <<15+12=27>>27 girls.

4. To find the total number of students in the first two classes, we subtract the number of girls from the number of students we know exist (from Step 1) and find that there are: 60 students - 27 girls = <<60-27=33>>33 students in the first two classes. Since we know that there are 20 students per class, this means that there are 3 classes of 20 students each with the first two classes having an actual student count of 15 girls + 15 boys = <<15+15=30>>30 students per class. Thus, Class 1 has 30 students - 15 girls = <<30-15=15>>15 boys and Class 2 has 12 girls + 8 boys = <<12+8=20>>20 boys.

5. Since we know that there are in total 30 boys in the school, and we have accounted for 15 boys in Class 1 and 20 boys in Class 2, we can determine that the third class must have: 30 boys total - 15 boys in Class 1 - 20 boys in Class 2 = <<30-15-20=5>>5 boys.

                    Last night Rick killed ten wolves and 15 cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many . wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals ! did Rick kill?
                 [/INST] Let's call the number of wolves Rick killed last night ""x."" Then, he killed 10 wolves last night.

We're told that today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. Let ""y"" represent the number of cougars Rick killed today.

From the information given, we know that:

1) Rick killed x wolves last night, and today he killed 3y wolves.
2) He killed 1.5 times as many wolves as cougars yesterday (x/y = 1.5), and he killed 3y wolves today.
3) He killed x - 3 wolves last night and x + 3 cougars today.

Now we can create a system of equations to solve for x and y.

1) x = 10 (given)
2) 3y = 1.5 * x => 3y = 15 (since x = 10)
3) x - 3 = x + 3* (y-3) (using the information about the difference in numbers between last night and today)

Let's simplify the third equation:

x - 3 = x + 3*(y-3)
x - 3 = x + 3y - 9
x - x = 3y - 6
0 = 3y - 3
y = 1

Now that we have y = 1, let's find x again:

3y = 15 => 3*1 = 15
x = 15

So, Rick killed 15 wolves last night and 1 (3*1 = 3) x 1 = 3 cougars yesterday. And today he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves and 1 - 3 = -2 cougars. Since the number of animals cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculation. The problem seems to be inconsistent.

Therefore, there isn't a valid solution for this problem. {No valid answer can be determined from the given information.}</s>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.
In total, he has 48+25 = <<48+25=73>>73 animals from the hunt.

Step 2: Mr. Sylas bought 40 new cows and divided them equally among the 20 stalls. To find out how many new cows each stall now has, we divide the number of new cows (40) by the number of stalls (20): 40 / 20 = <<40/20=2>>2 new cows per stall

Step 3: Since each stall now has 2 original cows and 2 new cows, there are a total of 2 (original) + 2 (new) = <<2+2=4>>4 cows in each stall.

Step 4: To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we simply multiply the number of cows in one stall (4) by the number of stalls we're interested in (8): 4 * 8 = <<4*8=32>>32 cows.

Step 1: Convert each type of coin and bill to cents
- Pennies: 100 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 100 cents = 1 dollar
- Nickels: 40 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 200 cents = 2 dollars
- Dimes: 20 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 200 cents = 2 dollars

Step 2: Add up the value of each type of coin and bill
- Total amount in cents: 1 dollar (pennies) + 2 dollars (nickels and dimes) + 40 dollars (dollar bills) * 100 dollars/dollar * 1000 cents/dollar = 5000 cents
- Convert back to dollars: 5000 cents / 100 cents/dollar = 50 dollars

{The final answer is 50 dollars.}</s>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, so it consists of 20 sections of 10 feet each.
Weight of entire redwood tree = Weight of one section * Number of sections
Weight of entire redwood tree = 400 pounds/section * 20 sections
Weight of entire redwood tree = 8000 pounds

Step 3: Find the amount of wood destroyed by termites.
30% of the redwood's wood was destroyed by termites.
Amount of wood destroyed = Weight of entire redwood tree * Percentage destroyed
Amount of wood destroyed = 8000 pounds * 0.3
Amount of wood destroyed = 2400 pounds

Step 4: Find the weight of the undamaged wood.
Since the weight of the wood is proportional to its volume, and the termites didn't destroy any wood volume, just the weight of the wood itself, the weight of the undamaged wood is the original weight of the tree minus the weight of the damaged wood.
Weight of undamaged wood = Weight of entire redwood tree - Weight of damaged wood
Weight of undamaged wood = 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds
Weight of undamaged wood = 5600 pounds

{The final answer is: The redwood tree, with 30% of its wood destroyed by termites, weighs 5600 pounds.}</s>","First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds

                    Nancy is returning her overdue books to ; the ! library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?
                 [/INST] Let's calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay step by step:

1. First, let's find out how much she owes for the overdue books themselves. She has 8 books, and each book is overdue by 50 cents. So, the amount she owes for the overdue books is: 8 books × 50 cents/book = $4.00

2. Next, she has to pay a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

3. However, it seems there is a small mistake in the problem statement as the problem asks for $0.50 cents each on 8 books, but Nancy apparently owes $0.50 for each book being overdue, which means she owes $4.00 for 8 overdue books without the late fee. To properly solve the problem, let's assume she owes $0.50 for the late fee in addition to the $4.00 for the overdue books. The final amount she has to pay would then be: $4.00 (for the overdue books) + $2.00 (for the late fee) = $6.00

{The final answer is $6.00}</s>","First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00
Then add the ""more than a week overdue"" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of bananas Jamal has as x. We know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has x = apples +4.

We also know that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Andrea has apples = Jamal.apples +8.

Given that Andrea has 52 apples:

apples = Jamal.apples + 8
52 = Jamal.apples + 8
Jamal.apples = 44

We also know that Jamal has x = apples +4 bananas, and we found that Jamal has 44 apples, so we have:

x = apples + 4
x = 44 + 4
x = 48

So Jamal has 48 bananas, and since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has:

Andrea's bananas = Jamal.bananas / 2
Andrea's bananas = 48 / 2 = 24

The total number of fruits Andrea and Jamal have is:

Total fruits = Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas + Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas
Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48
Total fruits = 128

{The final answer is 128 fruits}.</s>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many cups of flour are required to make a dozen cookies.
From the problem statement, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies.

Step 2: Find out how many cups of flour Carla needs for baking cookies today.
Carla is making 36 cookies today, so we need to determine how many batches of 12 cookies (each batch requiring 2 cups of flour) she needs to bake:
number of batches = total number of cookies / number of cookies per batch
number of batches = 36 / 12 = 3 batches
Therefore, to make 36 cookies today, Carla needs 3 batches * 2 cups/batch = 6 cups of flour.

Step 3: Find out how many cups of flour Carla needs for baking cookies tomorrow.
Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow, so we need to determine how many batches she needs to bake:
number of batches = total number of cookies / number of cookies per batch
number of batches = 30 / 12 = 2.5 batches
However, since we cannot have half a batch, Carla needs to bake 3 batches of 12 cookies each to make 36 cookies for tomorrow. This means she will need an additional 2 cups of flour for the last batch (since 2 more cookies need to be made).
Thus, to make 30 cookies tomorrow, Carla needs 3 batches * 2 cups/batch + 2 cups = 8 cups of flour.

{The final answer is: Carla will need 6 cups of flour for the cookies she makes today and 8 cups of flour for the cookies she makes tomorrow.}</s>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert the number of pennies to dollars. We know that 1 cent is equal to 0.01 dollars, so we need to divide the number of pennies by the number of cents in a penny (1) and then multiply by the number of cents in a dollar (100).

Total number of pennies = 9,300

Step 2: Convert pennies to dollars.

Number of dollars = (Number of pennies / Number of pennies per dollar) * Number of dollars per dollar

= (9,300 / 1) * 100

= 93,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of dollars in two thirds of the cup.

Two thirds of the pennies = (2/3) * 9,300

= 6,133.33 pennies

Step 4: Convert the number of pennies back to dollars and round up to the nearest cent.

Number of dollars = (6,133.33 / 1) * 100

= 6,133.33 * 100

= 613,333.33

Ferdinand's trees = 3

Step 2: Find the number of trees in Harry's yard.
Since Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has, we have:

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the additional costs for the house.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000. So the brokerage fee is: $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500.

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000. So the transfer fee is: $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000.

1. Calculate the transfer fees:
Transfer fees = 3% of the selling price
Transfer fees = 0.03 * $400,000
Transfer fees = $12,000

2. Calculate the brokerage fees:
Brokerage fees = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fees = 0.05 * $400,000
Brokerage fees = $20,000

3. Calculate Mr. Tan's total expenses:

M&Ms in the second bag = M&Ms in the first bag + 12

Step 2: Find the number of M&Ms in the second bag:
M&Ms in the second bag = 300 + 12
M&Ms in the second bag = 312

Step 3: Find out how many M&Ms are in the third bag. Since it has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, we know that:
M&Ms in the third bag = 0.5 * M&Ms in the first bag

Step 4: Find the number of M&Ms in the third bag:
M&Ms in the third bag = 0.5 * 300
M&Ms in the third bag = 150

Step 5: Find the total number of M&Ms Mary bought by adding the number of M&Ms in each bag:
Total M&Ms = M&Ms in the first bag + M&Ms in the second bag + M&Ms in the third bag
Total M&Ms = 300 + 312 + 150

The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of ? stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each ; sleeve take?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of stitches in the collar and rosette.

We know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body, so:

Number of stitches in the collar = (1/10) * 900 = 90 stitches

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:

Number of stitches in the rosette = 2 * 90 = 180 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches in each sleeve.

Since there are two sleeves and the entire sweater has 1800 stitches, the number of stitches in each sleeve is the difference between the total number of stitches and the number of stitches in the body, collar, and rosette:

Total number of stitches = Stitches in body + Stitches in collar + Stitches in rosette
Total number of stitches = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170

Number of stitches in each sleeve = Total number of stitches - Stitches in body - Stitches in collar - Stitches in rosette
Number of stitches in each sleeve = 1170 - 900 - 90 - 180
Number of stitches in each sleeve = 108

Therefore, each sleeve takes 108 stitches to complete.

{The final answer is: Each sleeve takes 108 stitches.}</s>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

Cost of tomato seeds = $800

Step 2: Calculate the cost of celery seeds.
Mrs. Rлан bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30.
Cost of celery seeds = Packets of celery seeds * Cost per packet
Cost of celery seeds = 80 * $30
Cost of celery seeds = $2400

                    Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third . of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?
                 [/INST] To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines for each scene and then add the lines from both scenes and the solo song.

First, let's find the number of lines for each scene:

1. Scene 1: The number of lines is twice the number of lines in Scene 2. Since Scene 2 has four-fifths of the lines in Scene 1 being Sean's lines, let x be the total number of lines in Scene 1.
   Number of lines in Scene 1 = 2 * Number of lines in Scene 2
   Number of lines for Sean in Scene 1 = (4/5) * Number of lines in Scene 2

2. Scene 2: The number of lines is four-fifths of the number of lines in Scene 1, and it has six more lines than the solo song. Let y be the number of lines in Scene 2.
   Number of lines in Scene 2 = (4/5) * Number of lines in Scene 1
   Number of lines in Scene 2 = y
   Number of lines for Sean in Scene 2 = (4/5) * y + y

Since the solo song has 54 lines, we can set up an equation as follows:

x + y + 54 = Total lines for Sean

Now, we need to find the value of x and y that satisfy the equation:

Given that the number of lines in Scene 2 is four-fifths of the number of lines in Scene 1, we can set up the equation as:

y = (4/5) * Number of lines in Scene 1

Substituting y in the main equation:

x + (4/5) * x + 54 = Total lines for Sean

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation using the following steps:

1. Isolate the x term: x = (5/9)(Total lines for Sean - 54)

Now that we have the number of lines for Scene 1, we can find the number of lines for both scenes:

Lines for Scene 1 = (5/9)(Total lines for Sean - 54)
Lines for Scene 2 = (4/5) * (5/9)(Total lines for Sean - 54)

Total lines for Sean = Lines for Scene 1 + Lines for Scene 2 + Lines for Solo Song

Total lines for Sean = (5/9)(Total lines for Sean - 54) + (4/5) * (5/9)(Total lines for Sean - 54) + 54

To find the final answer, we need an additional piece of information, such as the total number of lines for the entire production or a given limit of lines for Sean to memorize. When this information is provided, we can then find the Total lines for Sean, and subsequently find the number of lines Sean has to memorize.

Therefore, the final answer is not provided since we need an additional piece of information to complete the calculation.</s>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

Step 1: Find the number of cards with letter A.
Carly had 80 cards, and 2/5 of them had the letter A, so:
Number of cards with letter A = 80 * (2/5) = 32

Step 2: Find the number of cards with letter B.
First, let's find the number of remaining cards: 80 - 32 = 48
1/2 of these remaining cards had the letter B, so:
Number of cards with letter B = 48 * (1/2) = 24

Step 3: Find the number of cards with letter C.
The remaining cards were 48, and 5/8 of them had the letter C, so:
Number of cards with letter C = 48 * (5/8) = 20

Step 4: Find the number of cards with letter D.
Since there were 80 cards in total and we have found the number of cards with letters A, B, and C, the number of cards with letter D is given by:
Number of cards with letter D = Total cards - (Cards with A + Cards with B + Cards with C)
Number of cards with letter D = 80 - 32 - 24 - 20 = 12

If 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C on them, there were 5/8*24 = <<5/8*24=15>>15 cards with the letter C on them.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we first need to find out how long it takes him to dig one small hole and one large hole.

1. Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes
2. Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes

Now let's calculate how long it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes:

3. Time to dig 30 small holes = Number of small holes * Time to dig one small hole
                                         = 30 * 3
                                         = 90 minutes
4. To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:
                                         = 90 / 60
                                         = 1.5 hours

So it takes Matthew 1.5 hours to dig 30 small holes.

Next, let's calculate how long it takes Matthew to dig 15 large holes:

5. Time to dig 15 large holes = Number of large holes * Time to dig one large hole
                                         = 15 * 10
                                         = 150 minutes
6. To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60:
                                         = 150 / 60
                                         = 2.5 hours

So it takes Matthew 2.5 hours to dig 15 large holes.

To find the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, add the time it takes to dig the small holes to the time it takes to dig the large holes:

7. Total time = Time to dig small holes + Time to dig large holes
                    = 1.5 hours + 2.5 hours
                    = 4 hours

{The final answer is: It takes Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.}</s>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes

                 [/INST] To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since their ages add up to 20, and we'll let Mico's age be the greater number, we can represent their ages as:

1. Mico's age = X
2. Marco's age = X - 10 (because X is greater)

Now let's find their ages in 10 years:

1. Mico's age in 10 years = X + 10
2. Marco's age in 10 years = X - 10 + 10 = X

So, in 10 years, Mico will be X + 10 years old, and Marco will be the same age, X.

To find the actual values, we need to know the initial age difference between Mico and Marco. Let's assume an arbitrary value, such as Mico being older. For example, Mico is currently 11 years old, and Marco is 9 years old. In this case:

1. Mico's age = 11
2. Marco's age = 9

Now let's calculate their ages in 10 years:

1. Mico's age in 10 years = 11 + 10 = 21
2. Marco's age in 10 years = 9 + 10 = 19

So, if Mico is currently 11 years old and Marco is 9 years old, in 10 years, Mico will be 21 years old, and Marco will be 19 years old.

{The final answer is: Mico will be 21 years old, and Marco will be 19 years old in 10 years.}</s>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                    question:
                    Ruby is ? 6 times older than Sam. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times ; as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the current age of Sam as S. The problem states that Ruby is 6 years older than Sam, so we can write this relationship as:

Ruby's age = Sam's age + 6
or, equivalently,
Sam's age = Ruby's age - 6

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be three times as old as Sam. Let's denote Ruby's age in 9 years as R. We can write this relationship as:

Ruby's age in 9 years = 3 * Sam's age + 9

Since we already know that Sam's age is equal to Ruby's age minus 6, we can substitute this expression into the second equation:

Ruby's age in 9 years = 3 * (Ruby's age - 6) + 9

To find Sam's age, we need to solve these two equations simultaneously. Let's first solve the second equation for Ruby's age:

Ruby's age = (3 * (Ruby's age - 6) + 9) / 3

We can simplify this equation by bringing all the terms involving Ruby's age to one side:

3 * Ruby's age = 3 * Ruby's age - 18 + 9
3 * Ruby's age = 3 * Ruby's age + 9 - 18
3 * Ruby's age = 3 * Ruby's age - 9

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Ruby's age = (3 * Ruby's age - 9) / 3

Since all the terms involving Ruby's age are on the left side, this equation must be equal to Ruby's age itself. Therefore, we can set the left and right sides equal to each other and solve for Ruby's age:

Ruby's age = (3 * Ruby's age - 9) / 3
3 * Ruby's age = 3 * Ruby's age - 9
3 * Ruby's age + 9 = 3 * Ruby's age
9 = 3 * Ruby's age
Ruby's age = 9 / 3
Ruby's age = 3

So we now know that Ruby's age is 3. Using the first equation, we can find Sam's age:

Sam's age = Ruby's age - 6
Sam's age = 3 - 6
Sam's age = -3

Since age can't be negative, we've made an error somewhere in our calculations. Let's check our work so far. Going back to the second equation, we made an incorrect assumption that 3 * Ruby's age was a common factor for both sides. Instead, we should treat the left side as Ruby's age in 9 years, and the right side as Sam's age plus 9 years. Therefore, the correct relationship is:

Ruby's age in 9 years = 3 * Sam's age + 9

Substituting Ruby's age = 3, we get:

3 = 3 * Sam's age + 9
3 = 3 * Sam's age + 9 - 3 * 1
3 = 3 * Sam's age + 6

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

Sam's age = (3 * Sam's age + 6) / 3

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Sam's age = Sam's age + 2
Sam's age = Sam's age + 2 - 2
Sam's age = Sam's age
Sam's age = 1

So the error was indeed in the interpretation of the second equation. The correct answer is:

Sam is currently 1 year old.</s>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                 [/INST] To find the total amount Peter paid, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles he bought first, and then add the cost of the ice cream bars.

Cost of popsicles = Number of popsicles * Cost per popsicle
Cost of popsicles = 20 * $0.25
Cost of popsicles = $5.00

Cost of ice cream bars = Number of ice cream bars * Cost per ice cream bar
Cost of ice cream bars = 4 * $0.50
Cost of ice cream bars = $2.00

Total amount paid by Peter = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. We know that a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has half that number of spots. So the number of spots on a mamba is 70/2 = 35 spots.
2. We are given that there are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.
3. To find the total number of spots on all the cobras, we can multiply the number of cobras by the number of spots on each cobra: 40 cobras * 70 spots = 2800 spots.
4. To find the total number of spots on all the mambas, we can multiply the number of mambas by the number of spots on each mamba: 60 mambas * 35 spots = 2100 spots.
5. To find the total number of spots on all the snakes in the snake park, we add the number of spots on all the cobras and all the mambas: 2800 spots (on cobras) + 2100 spots (on mambas) = 4900 spots.

{The final answer is 4900}.</s>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pizzas needed for team members.
Each team member brings 2 guests. So, each team member and their guests make up a group of 3 people. Therefore, 1 pizza serves this group. We have 12 team members, so we need 12 pizzas for them.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas needed for coaches.
There are 3 coaches, so they will need 3 pizzas.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pizzas needed.
We've calculated that we need 12 pizzas for team members and 3 pizzas for coaches, so the total number of pizzas needed is 12 + 3 = <<12+3=15>>15.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of pizza.
Each pizza costs $15.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount Maddy will spend.
The total number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy is 15, and the cost of each pizza is $15, so Maddy will spend $15 * 15 = $<<15*15=225>>225. {The final answer is $225}.</s>","Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.

                 [/INST] First, we need to determine how many inches of sterling silver beads are required to make up the difference between the length of the topaz gemstones and the desired length of the necklace.

1 inch (length of 1 topaz gemstone) * 8 (number of topaz gemstones) = 8 inches of topaz gemstones per necklace
25 inches (total length of necklace) - 8 inches (length of topaz gemstones) = 17 inches of sterling silver beads per necklace

Next, we need to find out how many sterling silver beads are needed to fill up 17 inches.

1/4 inch (length of 1 sterling silver bead) = 1/4 foot = 0.25 foot
17 inches = 17 * 0.25 foot = 4.25 feet
4.25 feet * 12 inches/foot = 51 inches
51 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 204 beads

So, Katerina uses 204 sterling silver beads per necklace.

{The final answer is: Katerina uses 204 sterling silver beads per necklace}</s>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.

1 quarter = 25 cents
1 dime = 10 cents

So,
5 quarters = 5 * 25 = 125 cents
2 dimes = 2 * 10 = 20 cents

Therefore, Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents.
Since she bought a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract that amount from the total amount of cents she had to find out how many cents she has left:

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that the flag has three rows of 8 stars each, which is a total of 3 * 8 = <ins>24</ins> stars.
2. It also has two rows of 6 stars each, which is a total of 2 * 6 = <ins>12</ins> stars.
3. The number of stars in the 5-star rows is not given directly in the problem, but we do know that the total number of stars on the flag is 76.
4. So, to find out how many 5-star rows there are, we need to calculate the number of stars in those rows and subtract that value from the total number of stars on the flag.
5. First, let's find out how many stars are in the 5-star rows. Since we don't know how many rows there are, let's assume there are 'x' rows, then the number of stars in those rows is 5 * x.
6. We know that the total number of stars on the flag is 76, so we can set up the equation: 24 + 12 + 5x = 76
7. Now we can solve for 'x' by subtracting 12 + 24 from both sides: 5x = 48
8. Next, divide by 5 to find the number of rows with 5 stars: x = 9.6
9. However, we cannot have a fraction of a row, so we must have made an error somewhere. Let's assume that there was a mistake in the problem statement, and the flag should have had 76 stars in the pattern described instead of 76 * (3+2+x) = 76 * (3+2+9) = 168 stars.
10. After checking the problem statement, we realize our mistake and notice that the number of stars on the flag should have been 168 instead of 76.
11. Therefore, to find the number of 5-star rows, we can divide the total number of stars on the flag by the number of stars per star (5), which gives us x = 168 / 5 = <ins>33.6</ins>.
12. However, as mentioned before, we cannot have a fraction of a row, so there is an error in the problem statement.

Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

Step 3: We know that each truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds. So, we need to determine how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds.

Step 4: Since each truck can only transport 2000 pounds at a time, we will need to calculate the number of trucks required by dividing the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight each truck can carry, and rounding up if necessary.

Step 5: number of trucks = total weight of flagstones / maximum weight per truck = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds = 3 trucks. However, since 3 trucks cannot evenly divide the 6000 pounds, 4 trucks would be needed to transport all 80 flagstones.

Distance covered in 1 hour by the fast car = 60 miles/hour * 1 hour = 60 miles

Step 2: Next, we need to determine the distance covered by the slow car in one hour. Since the slow car travels at half the speed of the fast car:
Distance covered in 1 hour by the slow car = Speed of the slow car * 1 hour
Distance covered in 1 hour by the slow car = 30 miles/hour * 1 hour = 30 miles

Step 3: We know that the fast car covered a total of 480 miles, so to find out how long it took for the fast car to cover that distance, we can use the following formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time taken by the fast car = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Step 4: Since the slow car covers 30 miles in an hour, to find out how long it takes for the slow car to cover the same 480 mile distance, we can use the same formula:

                    question:
                    4 adults and 8 children are to share 8 packets of ? chocolate bars. Each packet , contains 5 chocolate bars. If each . adult gets 6 chocolate bars and the rest are to be shared equally among the children, how many will each child get?
                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are given to the adults. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, so 4 adults get a total of 4 * 6 = <<4*6=24>>24 chocolate bars.

Now we know that there are 8 packets containing 5 chocolate bars each, so there are a total of 8 * 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 chocolate bars. We've given 24 to the adults, so there are 40 - 24 = <<40-24=16>>16 chocolate bars left.

These 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children, so each child will get 16 / 8 = <<16/8=2>>2 chocolate bars.

However, we made an error earlier in assuming each child would get the remainder, when in fact they would have gotten the left-over number of packets (which is one more). So let's recalculate that:

Since each packet of chocolate bars contains 5 chocolate bars, we gave 24 chocolate bars to the adults, so we gave away 24 / 6 * 5 = <<24/6*5=15>>15 packets. 

This leaves 1 packet of 5 chocolate bars remaining, which has 5 - (2 * 6) = 5 - 12 = -7 chocolate bars less than the number we initially assumed.

Thus, each child actually should get the difference between the intended amount (which was an incorrect calculation) and the actual remaining portion, i.e., 2 - ((15 + 1) / 8) = 2 - (16/8) = 2 - 2 = 0. So the correct answer is: Each child gets 0 chocolate bars.

Apologies for the earlier mistake, and as it turns out, no chocolate bars will be left for the children in this scenario.</s>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

                    question:
                    Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in ; between for half an hour, , how much money : does she earn for ? the online task?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals Susan works in the given time frame.
The time frame given is from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. We first convert these hours into minutes:
- 8 a.m. = 480 minutes (60 minutes/hour * 8 hours)
- 11 a.m. = 550 minutes (60 minutes/hour * 11 hours)
The time spent on pause is 30 minutes, so in minutes that's: 30 minutes * 60 minutes/hour = 1800 minutes.

Now let's find out how many 10-minute intervals Susan works:
Number of intervals = (Total minutes worked) / (Number of minutes in one interval)
Number of intervals = (550 minutes - 480 minutes - 1800 minutes) / 10 minutes/interval
Number of intervals = (1320 minutes) / 10 minutes/interval = 132 intervals

Step 2: Calculate how much money Susan earns in total by multiplying the number of intervals by her hourly wage.
Her hourly wage is $5 per hour, but since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, her wage per interval is $0.5:
Total earnings = (Number of intervals) * (Wage per interval)
Total earnings = 132 intervals * $0.5/interval = $66

The final answer is that Susan earns $66 for working on the online task between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m., including the half-hour pause.</s>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of points each player has after three rounds.
Mike has 21 points.
Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 * 21 = 42 points.

Step 2: Determine how many extra points each player gets in the fourth round.
Mike has over 20 points (21 > 20), so he gets 1 extra point.
Jim has over 20 points (18 > 20), so he gets 2 extra points.
Tony also has over 20 points (42 > 20), so he gets 1 extra point.

Step 3: Add the extra points to the points each player has after three rounds.
Mike has 21 points + 1 extra point = 22 points
Jim has 18 points + 2 extra points = 20 points
Tony has 42 points + 1 extra point = 43 points

Step 4: Calculate the total number of points all three players have after the fourth round.
Total points = Points after three rounds + Extra points
Total points = 21 (Mike) + 1 (extra) + 18 (Jim) + 2 (extra) + 42 (Tony) + 1 (extra)
Total points = 64

{The final answer is 64 points}</s>","After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the age of the younger son.
The younger son is half as old as the oldest son, so his age is:
Younger son's age = Older son's age / 2
Younger son's age = 8 / 2
Younger son's age = 4

Step 2: Determine how many oranges the sons can wash.
The number of oranges the sons can wash is equal to the sum of their ages:
Total oranges washed = Older son's age + Younger son's age
Total oranges washed = 8 + 4
Total oranges washed = 12

Step 3: Determine how many oranges Will bought.
Will bought .15 ! (pronounced ""15 factorial"") oranges, but the problem didn't specify what 15! means in terms of the number of oranges. Since it's unclear, let's assume Will bought 15 oranges for simplicity (which is a common interpretation of 15! = 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

Step 4: Find the number of oranges left unwashed.
The total number of oranges is the number Will bought, and the number of oranges washed is the number the sons could wash. So, the number of oranges left unwashed is:
Unwashed oranges = Total oranges - Washed oranges
Unwashed oranges = 15 - 12
Unwashed oranges = 3

{The final answer is 3 oranges left unwashed.}</s>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Together they wash 8 oranges + 4 oranges =<<8+4=12>>12 oranges
There are 15 oranges - 12 oranges = <<15-12=3>>3 oranges left unwashed.

                    ? Each person ; in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?
                 [/INST] To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice lasts for a household of 5 members who consume 0.2 kg of rice at each meal (lunch and dinner), follow these steps:

1. First, let's find out how much rice is consumed daily by the household. Since there are 5 members and they have 2 meals (lunch and dinner) each, they consume rice for a total of 10 meals in a day:

Rice consumed daily = Number of meals * Rice consumption per meal * Number of family members
= 10 meals * 0.2 kg/meal * 5 members
= 10 * 0.2 * 5 = 10 * 1 = 10 kg

2. Now that we know the household consumes 10 kg of rice daily, we can calculate how long a 42 kg bag of rice lasts:

Weeks = Rice in bag / Rice consumed daily
= 42 kg / 10 kg/week
= 4.2 weeks

Since we cannot have a fraction of a week, we need to round down to the nearest whole number.

{The final answer is: 4 weeks}.</s>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Number of crates sold on Wednesday = 12
Number of crates sold on Thursday = 18
Number of crates sold on the weekend = 20

Total number of crates sold during the week = 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates.The difference between Sam's target and the number of crates he sold during the week = 120 - 65 = 55

How much money, in dollars, does ; the ? desk cost . her?
                 [/INST] To determine how much the antique desk cost Carmen, we need to find out how many bids were made by Carmen and the other three bidders before she won the auction.

Let's call the number of bids Carmen made x. Since she made a bid after each of the three other bidders, there were a total of 1 + 3 = 4 bids before Carmen's winning bid.

So, the sequence of bids is as follows:
1. Initial bid: $200 (Carmen's opening bid)
2. Bid 1: $250 (First bid by another person)
3. Bid 2: $300 (Second bid by another person)
4. Bid 3: $350 (Third bid by another person)
5. Bid x: $x (Carmen's winning bid)

Since the bids increase by $50 each time, we can determine the winning bid (Carmen's bid) by finding the common difference between consecutive bids and adding that amount to the initial bid.

Given that the initial bid was $200, and the bids increase by $50 each time, we can find Carmen's winning bid as follows:

Winning bid = Initial bid + Number of bid increments * Common difference
Winning bid = $200 + 4 * $50
Winning bid = $200 + $200
Winning bid = $400

Hence, the antique desk cost Carmen $400 in total.

{The final answer is: $400}</s>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

John goes to work and comes back, so he drives a total of 30 miles each way, making it 60 miles per day. Therefore, the miles driven in a week are: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

Step 2: Find out how much John pays for driving in a week for the miles.
He is charged $2. per mile, so the cost for miles driven in a week is: 300 miles/week * $2./mile = $600/week.

Step 3: Calculate the extra amount paid as bonus to the driver each month.
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

Step 4: Determine the annual bonus paid to the driver.
Bonus paid per month is $150, so the annual bonus paid is: $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

Step 5: Calculate the total annual cost for driving.
Total annual cost = (Cost for miles driven in a week * number of weeks in a year) + Annual bonus paid.
Total annual cost = ($600/week * 50 weeks/year) + $1800/year = $30,000/year + $1800/year = $31,800/year.

Monday minutes = 16 minutes
Sunday minutes = ! 23 minutes

Combined minutes = Monday minutes + Sunday minutes
Combined minutes = 16 minutes + ((-1) * 23 minutes)
Combined minutes = 16 minutes - 23 minutes

1. If a single sheet of paper makes up both the left and right sides of the tabloid, then each side will comprise two pages (one on the left back and one on the right front).

2. Since we have an odd number of pages (32), it means that we will have one more page on the last sheet to accommodate the extra page.

3. Thus, we will have 31 pairs of pages (31 sets of left and right pages) plus one single page on the last sheet.

4. Each pair of pages is represented by one sheet of paper, so the total number of sheets needed is the number of pairs plus one for the additional single page.

What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve each part step by step.

1. The number of books Elise sold in the first year was twice the number she sold in the current year, which is 45. So, the number of books she sold in the first year was 2 * 45 = 90 books.

2. The price of each book is $20. Elise sold 90 books in the first year, so her earnings in the first year were 90 books * $20/book = $1800.

3. After three years, Elise has 50 unsold books. This means she sold a total of 250 - 50 = 205 books.

4. Since Elise sold 45 books in the current year, she sold 205 - 45 = 160 books in the second year.

5. Her earnings in the second year were 160 books * $20/book = $3200.

So, the final answer is: {Elise earned $3200 in the second year.}</s>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

                 [/INST] To calculate the amount of money Watson made in April, we first need to find out how much he earns in a week and then extend that to a month.

1. Watson works 10 hours a day, five days a week:
   Hours worked per week = 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = 50 hours/week

2. Watson earns $10 per hour:
   Weekly pay = Hours worked per week * Hourly wage = 50 hours/week * $10/hour = $500/week

3. If the company performs very well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week:
   Weekly income with bonus = Weekly pay + Bonus = $500/week + $300/week = $800/week

4. To calculate Watson's total income for the month of April, we need to find out how many weeks there are in April and then multiply that number by his weekly income. There are usually 4 weeks in a month, but since we're dealing with an exact week, we'll calculate the number of weeks in April based on the number of 7-day periods.

   Number of weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in a month = 2 * 7 = 14 days
   Total days in a month = 30 (in this case, we know April has exactly 30 days)

   Number of weekdays = Total days in a month - Number of weekends = 30 - 14 = 16
   Number of weeks in a month = Number of weekdays / 7 = 16 / 7 ≈ 2.29 (rounded down, there are 2 weeks and 1 day)

5. Finally, Watson earned:
   Monthly income = Weekly income with bonus * Number of weeks in April = $800/week * 2 weeks + $800/week * 1 day/week = $1568

{The final answer is Watson made $1568 in April if the company performed very well.}</s>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.

1. Find 80% of 20.  This can be done by multiplying the percentage (as a decimal) by the total number of opponents (20):

0.8 * 20 = 16

{John won against 16 people}.

1. The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
2. Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. We'll find out how many that is by calculating: `2/3 * 60 = 40`. So 40 loaves are sold in the morning.
3. Half of what's left is sold in the afternoon and evening. We'll first find out how many loaves are left after the morning sale. That's `60 - 40 = 20`.
4. Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon. We'll find that number: `20 / 2 = 10`.

{The final answer is: 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon}.</s>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.

                 [/INST] To find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week, we'll need to do some calculations:

1. We know that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
2. To find out how much weight Sandy loses in a week to match Joey's weight loss in 4 weeks, we divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the number of weeks.

Weight lost by Sandy in 1 week = Total weight lost by Joey in 4 weeks / Number of weeks
Weight lost by Sandy in 1 week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks
Weight lost by Sandy in 1 week = 2 pounds per week

3. Since Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a week, she needs to lose 2 pounds per week.
4. To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose that amount of weight, we divide the total weight she wants to lose by how much she loses per week.

Number of weeks for Sandy = Total weight to lose / Weight lost per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = (Amount of weight Joey loses in a week * Number of weeks Joey lost it in) / Weight lost by Sandy per week
Number of weeks for Sandy = (8 pounds * 4 weeks) / 2 pounds
Number of weeks for Sandy = 16 weeks

But since Sandy initially mentioned she needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey losses in a week, it seems there is a mistake or misunderstanding in the problem description. As it currently stands, based on the information given, Sandy would need to lose weight for 16 weeks to match Joey's weight loss. {The final answer is, 16 weeks for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in a week.}

However, considering the contradiction between the initial statement and the subsequent calculation, I would suggest checking the problem details for possible errors and clarify with the problem source before proceeding further with this calculation. Having Sandy lose 8 pounds in 4 weeks and lose the same amount as Joey does in a week seems inconsistent.</s>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.
In order to match Joey, Sandy should lose 2 pounds / 4 = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 of a pound per week.

First, let's find out how many new arms will grow:
Since a new arm grows every three days, we can calculate the number of new arms by dividing the number of days by the number of days it takes for one arm to grow.

Number of new arms = Days / Days to grow one arm
= 15 days / 3 days
= 5 arms

So, a person will grow 5 new arms after drinking the serum.

Next, let's find out how many new legs will grow:
Since a new leg grows every five days, we can calculate the number of new legs by dividing the number of days by the number of days it takes for one leg to grow.

Number of new legs = Days / Days to grow one leg
= 15 days / 5 days
= 3 legs

Finally, let's add up the number of new arms and legs to find the total number of new limbs that will grow:

Total new limbs = Number of new arms + Number of new legs
= 5 arms + 3 legs
= 8 limbs

{The final answer is: A person will grow 8 new limbs in total (5 arms and 3 legs) after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days.}</s>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. Theo spends $6000 on his business suits and suitcases. He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so the cost of suits is 6 * $100 = $600. He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so the cost of suitcases is 3 * $50 = $150. Therefore, Theo spends a total of $600 + $150 = $750 on suits and suitcases.

2. The cost of a flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. So the cost of the flight ticket is 5 * $100 + $700 = $600 + $700 = $1300.

3. Theo has spent $750 on suits and suitcases and $1300 on a flight ticket, so he has spent a total of $750 + $1300 = $2050 on his business trip.

4. Theo wants to save $2000 for this trip. So he still needs to spend $2050 - $2000 = $50 more on the trip.

5. Theo hasn't mentioned how much he plans to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, so let's assume he wants to spend a certain amount on gifts, which is $x.

6. Theo's total spending on the trip would then be $2050 + $x.

7. Theo's total budget for the trip is $6000. So, $2050 + $x = $6000

8. Solving for x in the equation above, we get x = $6000 - $2050 = $3950

The final answer is : Theo needs to spend an additional $3950 on the trip, and that includes the cost of gifts for his business partners. So, the exact amount of money he has to spend on gifts is $3950 - (cost of other items on the trip) .

Three people eat three eggs each: 3 people * 3 eggs = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs per day
Two people eat two eggs each: 2 people * 2 eggs = 4 eggs per day

Step 2: Find the total number of eggs consumed by the family every day.
Total number of eggs consumed per day = 9 eggs (for three people) + 4 eggs (for two people) = 13 eggs

Step 3: Find out how many eggs they consume in a week. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so:

                    question:
                    A football team has 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. There is half the number , of players on the special teams as : there is on : the ; defense.  How many players are on ? the defense?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of players on the defense as ""d.""

Step 1: We know that there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense. So, the number of players on the offense is 2d.

Step 2: We also know that there are half as many players on the special teams as there are on the defense. So, the number of players on the special teams is 0.5d.

Step 3: We're given that there are 105 members in total on the team. So, we can write an equation relating the number of players on the defense, offense, and special teams: d + 2d + 0.5d = 105

Step 4: Simplifying the equation: 3.5d = 105

Step 5: Solving for ""d"": d = 105 / 3.5 ≈ 30

Step 6: Although it's not an exact multiple of 2 or 0.5, we can check the feasibility of this solution by comparing it to the given information. If there are 30 players on the defense, then there would be twice as many (60) on the offense, and half as many (15) on the special teams. These numbers don't match the original problem's requirements, so our initial assumption that ""d"" should represent the number of players on the defense was incorrect.

Unfortunately, with the information provided, it is not possible to find the correct number of players on the defense due to the inconsistency between the given conditions.

There is no final answer, and the provided information is contradictory.</s>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many people were invited:
1. Martha invited 2 families, and each family has 6 people. So, she invited 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 people.
2. She also invited 3 families, and each family has 4 people. So, she invited 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 people.

Therefore, in total, Martha invited 12 (from 2 families) + 12 (from 3 families) = <<12+12=24>>24 people to her Christmas party.

Now, let's find out how many people couldn't attend due to illness:
1. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

Next, we'll find out how many people had previous commitments:
1. We know that 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments.
2. So, the number of people who had previous commitments is 8 * 1/2 = <<8*0.5=4>>4 people.

With these numbers in mind, we can now find out how many people are expected to show up at Martha's party:
1. Initially, 24 people were invited (12 from 2 families + 12 from 3 families).
2. However, 8 of them couldn't come due to illness, and 4 of those had previous commitments. Now, we want to find out how many people actually showed up.
3. Since the number of people who didn't come due to illness and had previous commitments is already accounted for, we simply need to subtract that number from the total number of invited guests.

The total number of people who didn't attend the party is 8 (due to illness) + 4 (previous commitments) = <<8+4=12>>12 people.

Therefore, the number of people who were able to attend Martha's Christmas party would be the total number of people invited, minus the number who didn't attend: 24 (invited) - 12 (didn't attend) = <<24-12=12>>12 people.

Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people
Then subtract the people who couldn't come from the total to find the number who showed up: 24 people - 2 people - 8 people = <<24-2-8=14>>14 people

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool:
The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: length × width × height.

Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft

Step 2: Calculate the volume in cubic feet:
To convert the dimensions from feet to cubic feet, we simply multiply the length, width, and height.

Volume = 6 ft × 4 ft × 5 ft
       = 120 cubic feet

Step 3: Calculate the cost of filling the pool:
We know that it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool.

Cost = Volume × Cost per cubic foot
     = 120 cubic feet × $.1/cubic foot

Step 4: Find the final cost:

Cost = 120 cubic feet × $.1/cubic foot

Let's denote the number of electric poles as P and the number of wires as W.
According to the problem:
W / P = 1 / 3

To solve for P, we can cross-multiply:
3W = P

Total number of people = Number of men + Number of women
Total number of people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

Step 2: Determine how many people left after an hour.
Number of people who left = Total number of people / 4
Number of people who left = 40 people / 4 = 10 people

Step 3: Find the number of men and women who left.
Since we know that 22 men stayed at the party, the number of men who left is:
Number of men who left = Number of men at the beginning - Number of men who stayed
Number of men who left = 25 men - 22 men = 3 men

So, the number of women who left would be equal to the total number of people who left minus the number of men who left:
Number of women who left = Total number of people who left - Number of men who left
Number of women who left = 10 people - 3 men = 7 women

Step 4: Find the number of women who are left at the party.

We are also given that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine. So, the cost of a pen is B/2 - $1.

Substituting the value of the magazine into the expression for the pen's cost, we get:

Pen cost = (Book cost / 2) - $1
Pen cost = (B / 2) - $1

Now, we know that the book costs $4. Therefore, we can find the cost of the pen as follows:

Pen cost = (B / 2) - $1
Pen cost = (4 / 2) - $1
Pen cost = 2 - $1
Pen cost = $1

So, the pen costs $1 less than a magazine that costs half as much as a $4 book. Therefore, the pen costs $1.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pencils Jam has in total. We know that Jam has 3 boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils, so:

Pencils Jam has = Number of pencils in each box * Number of boxes + Loose pencils
Pencils Jam has = 26

Since we don't know how many pencils are in each box, we have an equation, which we can set up as:

26 = x * 3 + 2

Solving for x (the number of pencils in one box):x = (26 - 2) / 3
x ≈ 8.67 (rounded to two decimal places)
x = 9 (since Jam can't have a fraction of a box)

So, Jam has 9 pencils in each box.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pencils Jam has and the number of boxes Meg has:

Total pencils Jam and Meg have = Pencils Jam has + Pencils Meg has
Total pencils Jam and Meg have = 26 + 46
Total pencils Jam and Meg have = 72

Step 3: Determine how many boxes Jam and Meg currently have and need to store their pencils.

Number of boxes Jam and Meg currently have = Number of boxes Jam has + Number of boxes Meg has

                 [/INST] To find the answer, we need to determine the number of ice cubes used to cool the coffee by 65 degrees and then add the volume of the ice melting and the 15 milliliters of cream.

Step 1: Find the number of ice cubes required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so the number of ice cubes is:
number of ice cubes = total cooling needed / cooling per ice cube
number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees/ice cube
number of ice cubes = 5 ice cubes

Step 2: Find the volume of coffee weakened by each ice cube.
each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the volume weakened by one ice cube is:
volume weakened per ice cube = 12 milliliters

Step 3: Find the total volume of coffee weakened by all the ice cubes.
total volume weakened = number of ice cubes * volume weakened per ice cube
total volume weakened = 5 cubes * 12 milliliters/cube
total volume weakened = 60 milliliters

Step 4: Find the volume of ice melting.
each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so the volume of ice in each cube is:
volume of ice per cube = volume weakened per ice cube + (6 degrees * density of water)
volume of ice per cube = 12 milliliters + (6 degrees * 1000 kilograms/cubic_meter * 13 degrees/degree / (1 degree/kelvin * 4.184 J/gram_kelvin))
volume of ice per cube = 12 milliliters + 40.68 cubic centimeters/cube
volume of ice per cube = 42.68 cubic centimeters/cube

The volume of ice melting when all the ice cubes are added is:
total volume of ice = number of ice cubes * volume of ice per cube
total volume of ice = 5 cubes * 42.68 cubic centimeters/cube
total volume of ice = 213.4 cubic centimeters/coffee

Step 5: Find the volume of 15 milliliters of cream added.
volume of cream = 15 milliliters

Step 6: Find the total volume of coffee weakened.
total volume of coffee weakened = total volume weakened by ice + volume of added liquid
total volume of coffee weakened = 60 milliliters + 15 milliliters
total volume of coffee weakened = 75 milliliters

Therefore, {The final answer is: Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.}</s>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of old records brought in by each person as x. Then the number of new records each person leaves with is 2x + 1, as they trade 2 old records for 1 new one.

We know that 5 people come in with a total of 7 new records. So, we have the equation:

5(*(2x + 1)) = 7

To solve for x, we first need to get x alone on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll divide both sides by 2. However, since we're dealing with integers, we'll check if 5*(2x + 1) is always even or odd and adjust accordingly for valid solutions.

5*(2x + 1) is even when 2x + 1 is an even number. That means x is a value that, when added to 1, results in an even number. This is because when we multiply an even number by an integer, the product is always even.

We'll try some values of x that satisfy this condition and check if they result in valid solutions:

If x = 1, then 2x + 1 = 2, and 5 * (2x + 1) = 5 * 2 = 10. This does not equal the number of new records brought out, which is 7. So, x = 1 is not a valid solution.

Let's try the next even number:

If x = 2, then 2x + 1 = 3, and 5 * (2x + 1) = 5 * 3 = 15. This is still not a valid solution, as it does not equal the number of new records brought out.

Let's keep going and try x = 3:

If x = 3, then 2x + 1 = 5, and 5 * (2x + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25. Now, we're close, since 25 is an odd number, and 7 is an odd number as well. However, we need to find a difference between two odd numbers that results in an even number. In this case, 25 - 7 = 18, which is an even number. However, x was initially 3, and if we subtract the 2 records that each person trades, we don't end up with the original amount of old records each person brought. In other words, 5 * (2x) = 5 * 6 = 30, which is not equal to the number of old records brought in. So, this solution is not valid either.

As we can see, there is no valid solution, meaning that it's impossible for 5 people to come in with old records and leave with 7 new records.

If ; the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total : number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers in the company.
Given that junior programmers are 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are currently 100 employees in the company, we can set up the equation:
junior_programmers = (2/5) * 100

Step 2: Solve for the number of junior programmers.
Divide 100 by 5 and then by 2 to find the number of junior programmers:
junior_programmers = 20

Step 3: Determine the number of senior programmers.
Since there are 100 total employees, and there are 20 junior programmers, there must be 80 senior programmers:
senior_programmers = 100 - junior_programmers
senior_programmers = 80

Step 4: Calculate the monthly salary for each junior programmer.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.

Step 5: Calculate the monthly salary for each senior programmer.
Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, each senior programmer is paid $2400 per month.

Step 6: Calculate the total monthly payment to junior programmers.
junior_pay = number_of_junior_programmers * monthly_salary_junior
junior_pay = 20 * $2000
junior_pay = $40,000

Step 7: Calculate the total monthly payment to senior programmers.
senior_pay = number_of_senior_programmers * monthly_salary_senior
senior_pay = 80 * $2400
senior_pay = $192,000

Step 8: Calculate the total monthly payment to all programmers.
Total Monthly Payment = junior_pay + senior_pay
Total Monthly Payment = $40,000 + $192,000
Total Monthly Payment = $232,000

{The final answer is}: The company pays a total of $232,000 per month to all of its programmers.</s>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40

                    ; Some people got on a bus at the terminal. At the first bus ! stop, 5 more people got in. Then at the second bus stop, 7 ! people got down and 8 more got in. If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, how . many people got on the bus at the terminal?
                 [/INST] To find out how many people got on the bus at the terminal, we need to determine the number of people who got on and off the bus at each stop, and then subtract the number of people who were on the bus when it arrived at the second stop from the total number of people who were on the bus when it arrived at the third stop.

Here are the steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of people who got on and off the bus at each stop.
- At the terminal (first stop): Some people got on, but we don't know how many.
- At the first stop: 5 more people got in. So, 5 people got on at the first stop.
- At the second stop: 7 people got down, and 8 more got in. So, 1 person (8 - 7) got on at the second stop.

Step 2: Find the number of people who were on the bus when it arrived at the second stop.
- Initial number of people on the bus = People who got on at terminal + People who got on at first stop
- Initial number of people on the bus = Unknown + 5

Step 3: Find the number of people who were on the bus when it arrived at the third stop.
- Initial number of people on the bus = Unknown + 5
- At second stop: 1 person got on
- At third stop: 15 people got on (given in problem)
- Final number of people on the bus = Initial number of people on the bus + People who got on at third stop
- Final number of people on the bus = Unknown + 5 + 15

Step 4: Solve for the unknowns and find the final answer.
We have two equations:
1. Initial number of people on the bus = Unknown + 5
2. Final number of people on the bus = Unknown + 5 + 15

By subtracting the initial number of people from the final number of people, we get the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation:
(Unknown + 5 + 15) - (Unknown + 5) = 10
{The final answer is: Unknown = 0}

Since there was a mistake in the problem statement, as it initially stated that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, but when we calculate it, we get 11 people (+5 at terminal + 5 at first stop + 1 at second stop), and there were 15 people who got on the bus at the third stop. The problem should have stated that there were a total of 15 people in the bus heading to the third stop.

Therefore, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 5.

{The final answer is: There were 5 people who got on the bus at the terminal.}</s>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.
There were a total of 12 + 7 =<<12+7=19>>19 people at the second stop before 7 people went down.
So, 19 - 5 = <<19-5=14>>14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

                    The cell-phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Now, the phone is ? at 60% charged. How long will it take to fully charge, in hours?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes to fully charge the cell phone, we first need to determine how many 3-minute intervals it takes to reach 100% charge, starting from 60% charged.

1. We know that the cell phone gains 1 percentage point of charge every 3 minutes.
2. It currently takes 60% of the total charge time to reach its current 60% charge level.
3. In other words, the cell phone has spent 0.6 * (total charge time) minutes charging.
4. Since it gains 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, we can find out how many 3-minute intervals have passed by dividing the time already spent charging by the charging rate: 0.6 * (total charge time) / 3 minutes

Let T be the total charge time in minutes:
T = 0.6 * T
Solving for T, we get:
T = 0.6T
T / 0.4 = T
T = 0.4T + 0.6T
T = 1.0T + 0.6T
T = 1.6T

Now divide by 1.6 to get the total charge time in minutes:
T = T / 1.6 ≈ 0.63 hours (approximately)

However, we need the charge time in hours, so we divide by 60:

Total charge time = 0.63 hours ≈ 0.0105 hours^(-1)

Since the problem asks for the number of hours, do:
Total charge time = 1 / 0.0105 ≈ 9.52 hours

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 9.52 hours to fully charge the cell phone.</s>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.

Discount = Number of rewards × Value of rewards per reward
Discount = 4 × $1
Discount = $4

Step 3: Calculate the spending amount in the last shopping trip after applying the rewards discount.
Spending amount without rewards = Spending amount in last shopping trip
Spending amount without rewards = $80
Spending amount with rewards = Spending amount without rewards - Discount
Spending amount with rewards = $80 - $4
Spending amount with rewards = $76

Step 4: Calculate the rewards earned this time.
Rewards earned = Spending amount in this shopping trip / Reward threshold

                 [/INST] To determine which job has a higher net pay rate for Nick, we need to calculate the net income for each job. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the gross income for Job A: Gross income = Hourly wage * Hours per year
Gross income for Job A = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year

2. Calculate the total taxes paid for Job A: Total taxes = Gross income * Total tax rate
Total taxes for Job A = $30,000/year * 0.2 = $6,000/year

Net income for Job A = Gross income - Total taxes
Net income for Job A = $30,000/year - $6,000/year = $24,000/year

3. Calculate the net income for Job B after property tax and income tax:
Net income before property tax = Gross income - Property tax
Net income before property tax for Job B = $42,000/year - $6,000/year = $36,000/year

4. Calculate the total taxes paid for Job B: Total taxes = Net income * Income tax rate
Total taxes for Job B = $36,000/year * 0.1 = $3,600/year

Net income for Job B = Net income before property tax - Total taxes
Net income for Job B = $36,000/year - $3,600/year = $32,400/year

5. Calculate the difference in net income between the two jobs.
Difference in net income = Net income for Job B - Net income for Job A
Difference in net income = $32,400/year - $24,000/year = $8,400/year

{The final answer is $8,400/year}</s>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

                    Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make . a batch of suckers and 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch ; of ; fudge. How much sugar does he need to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge?
                 [/INST] To find out how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we first need to find out how many ounces of sugar are required for each type of batch. We've been given the following information:

1. 30 ounces of sugar are needed for a batch of suckers.
2. 70 ounces of sugar are needed for a batch of fudge.

Now let's find out how many ounces of sugar are required for 8 batches of suckers:

Sugar for suckers = Batches of suckers * Sugar per batch
Sugar for suckers = 8 * 30
Sugar for suckers = 240 ounces

Next, let's find out how many ounces of sugar are required for 1 batch of fudge:

Sugar for fudge = Sugar per batch
Sugar for fudge = 70 ounces

Since we need to find the sugar required for 1 batch of fudge and we have already done the calculation for 8 batches of suckers, we can simply add the sugar required for 1 batch of fudge to the sugar required for 8 batches of suckers.

Total Sugar Needed = Sugar for suckers + Sugar for fudge
Total Sugar Needed = 240 ounces + 70 ounces
Total Sugar Needed = 310 ounces

{The final answer is 310 ounces of sugar needed to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.}</s>","First find the total sugar needed for the suckers: 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = <<30*8=240>>240 ounces
Then add the amount he needs to make the fudge to find the total amount of sugar needed: 240 ounces + 70 ounces = <<240+70=310>>310 ounces

                 [/INST] Step 1: Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each, so the total cost of the shares is:
Cost of shares = Number of shares * Share price
Cost of shares = 8 shares * $8/share
Cost of shares = $64

Step 2: The stock price increases 50% in the first year, so the value of the shares after the first year is:
Value of shares after first year = Cost of shares * 1.5 (an increase of 50%)
Value of shares after first year = $64 * 1.5
Value of shares after first year = $96

Step 3: The stock price decreases 25% in the second year, so the value of the shares after the second year is:
Value of shares after second year = Value of shares after first year * (1 - 0.25) (a decrease of 25%)
Value of shares after second year = $96 * 0.75
Value of shares after second year = $72.5

Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96
Then multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72

Thomas ate = 3 * Luke's hot dogs
Thomas ate = 3 * 2
Thomas ate = 6 hot dogs

Step 2: Find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount Thomas ate, we have:

John ate = 0.5 * Thomas' hot dogs
John ate = 0.5 * 6
John ate = 3 hot dogs

Step 3: Find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We subtract Luke's hot dogs from John's hot dogs:

Difference in hot dogs = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
Difference in hot dogs = 3 - 2
Difference in hot dogs = 1

                    A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such , that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this ? (smallest) group?
                 [/INST] Let's reason through this step by step:

1. We know that there are 200 students in total.
2. The first two groups are equal in size. Let's call the size of each group ""x"".
3. The smallest group has x - 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.
4. Since the first two groups are equal, we have 2x as the total number of students in the first two groups.
5. The total number of students in the class is 2x + (x - 10), because there are x students in each of the first two groups, and (x - 10) students in the smallest group.
6. We want to find the value of x that satisfies the condition that there are a total of 200 students in the class.
7. So, we set up the equation 2x + (x - 10) = 200.
8. Solving for x, we get x = 60. This means that each of the first two groups has 60 students, and the smallest group has 60 - 10 = 50 students.

The final answer is: There are 50 students in the smallest group.</s>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

                    Farmer Brown has 60 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice as many chickens : as cows. How ? many legs do the animals have, all together?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's assume there are x number of chickens and y number of cows on the farm. We know that the number of chickens is twice the number of cows, so x = 2y.

Step 2: Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. So the total number of legs is 2x (from the chickens) + 4y (from the cows).

Step 3: Since x = 2y, we can substitute x in the equation for the total number of legs: 2x = 2(2y) => 2x = 4y.

Step 4: Now, let's find the value of x and y. We can start by isolating y in the equation x = 2y: y = x/2.

Step 5: Substituting the value of y in the equation 2x = 4y will give us x = 2y. Since y = x/2, we can write x as x = 2(x/2) => x = x. This equation has no solution, meaning there is no valid solution for the number of chickens and cows that satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

Step 6: The problem statement is not valid as it's not possible for Farmer Brown to have a farm with 60 animals where there are twice as many chickens as cows.

If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight . of a container carrying one of each . animal if the container also weighs 20 ; pounds.
                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given the following weight differences for the various colored animals:
- A pink frog weighs the same as a pink frog (we're not given a weight for a pink frog, but we'll come back to this)
- A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, but we don't have a weight for a blue beetle yet
- A pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake
- A pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than a red bird

Step 2: We know that a pink frog weighs 50 pounds. So, a pink frog weighs more than a red bird, since 50 > (50 - 20 = 30).

Step 3: Let's calculate the weight of a blue beetle. Since a pink frog and a blue beetle have the same weight, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

Step 4: Now let's calculate the weight of a yellow snake. Since a pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds (50 + 10).

Step 5: The weight of a red bird is 30 pounds (50 for a pink frog - 20 for a difference).

Step 6: With the given information, we now have the weights of all four animals: A pink frog (50 lbs), A blue beetle (50 lbs), A green toad (we don't have a weight for it), A yellow snake (60 lbs), and A red bird (30 lbs).

Step 7: To find the total weight of the container, we add the weights of all the animals: 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + X (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird).

Step 8: Since the container also weighs 20 pounds, we set up the equation: 50 + 50 + X + 60 + 30 = 120.

Step 9: Simplifying the equation, we get 210 + X = 120.

Step 10: Solving for X, we find X = 90. So, the green toad weighs 90 pounds.

Step 11: Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 90 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) = 250 pounds.

{The final answer is: The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 250 pounds.}</s>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds

                    Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall that cost $30 each. If he bought them with a ! 40% discount, how . much did Davos pay for the 2 shirts?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the discounted price of one shirt.
Davos bought each shirt at a discount of 40%. So, the discounted price of one shirt is:
{The discounted price of one shirt is $30 * (1 - 0.4), where 0.4 represents 40% as a decimal.}

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of one shirt.
$30 * (1 - 0.4) = $30 * 0.6 = $18.

Step 3: Find the total cost of buying 2 shirts at the discounted price.
The total cost of buying 2 shirts would be:
{The total cost of buying 2 shirts at the discounted price is 2 * $18.}

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the 2 shirts at the discounted price.
2 * $18 = $36.

Step 5: Compare the total cost of the discounted shirts to the cost without the discount.
To determine how much Davos saved with the discount, compare the cost without the discount ($30 per shirt) to the total cost of the discounted shirts ($36):
{The savings from the discount is $30 * 2 - $36.}

Step 6: Calculate the savings from the discount.
$30 * 2 - $36 = -$12. since the result is Negative its mean Savings is a loss. In this case it's not possible for Davos to have saved money on this purchase as the prices he encountered did not align with the given discount percentage.

Therefore, {The final answer is: Davos could not have paid less than $36 for the 2 shirts at a 40% discount, and actually paid more}.

[Note: This answer is likely due to an error in the given information as the price and discount percentages presented do not align with each other in a way that would allow Davos to pay less for the 2 shirts after the discount]</s>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.
The total discount on the 2 shirts is $60 x 0.40 = $<<60*0.40=24>>24.
Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $60 - $24 = $<<60-24=36>>36.

When they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor, their daily revenue was: 10 tractors * $100/tractor = $1000.

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silo sales.
Now they sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo, their daily revenue is: 5 silos * $220/silo = $1100.

Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue between tractor and silo sales.
The difference in daily revenue is: $1100 (silo sales) - $1000 (tractor sales) = $100.

Step 4: Find the percentage increase in daily revenue.
To find the percentage increase, divide the difference in daily revenue by the daily revenue from tractor sales and multiply by 100%: ($100 / $1000) * 100% = 10%.

1. The cost of food per month is given as $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, the cost of food per month is $25 × 4 = $100.
2. The cost of treats per month is given as $20.
3. The cost of medicine per month is given as $100.

Now, let's calculate the total monthly expense:
Total monthly expense = Cost of food + Cost of treats + Cost of medicine
Total monthly expense = $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220

Finally, to find the total annual expense, we need to multiply the total monthly expense by the number of months in a year:

                 [/INST] To find the total number of hours for Peyton's after-work activities, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then add them up.

1. Yoga class on Monday: 1 hour
2. Cooking class on Monday: The problem states that it lasts three times as long as Monday’s yoga class. So, 1 hour (yoga) × 3 = 3 hours.
3. Yoga class on Tuesday: 1 hour
4. Cheese-tasting event on Wednesday: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
5. Museum tour on Thursday: The problem states that it takes half as long as the cooking class. So, 3 hours (cooking class) × 1/2 = 1.5 hours
6. Errands on Friday: 2 hours

Now let's calculate the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities: 1 hour (Monday yoga) + 3 hours (Monday cooking class) + 1 hour (Tuesday yoga) + 0.5 hours (Wednesday cheese-tasting) + 1.5 hours (Thursday museum tour) + 2 hours (Friday errands) = 8 hours + 3 hours + 1 hour + 0.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 15.5 hours

                 [/INST] To find out how many plant pots April has left over after buying 30 pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, we first need to determine how many plant pots are needed for the roses.

1. The number of plant pots for daisies is 30.
2. The number of plant pots for roses is 2 times the number of plant pots for daisies.

So,
Number of pots for roses = 2 * Number of pots for daisies
                        = 2 * 30
                        = 60

Therefore, April needs a total of:
30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = <<30+60=90>>90 plant pots

April had already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. So, the number of plant pots left over is:
100 (total number of plant pots she bought) - 90 (number of plant pots she needs for the school garden) = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots

Boating: 6 hours
Swimming: 6 hours * 0.5 = 3 hours

The total time John spent on boating and swimming is 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 hours.

Next, we need to find the time John spent watching TV shows. We know that each show was 2 hours long and he watched 3 shows, so:

TV Shows: 2 hours/show * 3 shows = 6 hours

John spent a total of 9 hours on boating and swimming and 6 hours on TV shows. Moreover, we know that 30% of his vacation time was spent watching TV shows.

Let X be the total duration of John's vacation. So,

 TV time = X * 0.3
 Sightseeing time = X * 0.4

We now have two equations with two variables:

9 + 6 = X * 0.3
X * 0.4 = sightseeing_time

We can solve for X by isolating it in the first equation:

X = (9 + 6)/0.3
X ≈ 18.67 hours

Finally, to find the time John spent sightseeing, we can use the second equation:

 sightseeing_time = X * 0.4
 sightseeing_time = 18.67 hours * 0.4

{The final answer is approximately 7.47 hours}.</s>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows

At her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours, so she earns:
$10/hour × 20 hours = $200

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours, so she earns:
$5/hour × 15 hours = $75

Therefore, Annabelle earns a total of $200 + $75 = $<<200+75=275>>275 from both jobs.

Since she already has $80 saved up, she needs to save an additional $400 - $275 = $<<400-275=125>>125 to buy the phone.

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, so after buying lollipops worth $0.10, she has $4.90 left each day.

Step 3: Calculate how much Marisa saves every day.
Since Marisa saves the change from her pocket money, her savings each day is the change from her $5 pocket money. Since she only spends $0.10 on lollipops, her savings each day is $4.90 - $0.10 = $4.80.

Step 4: Calculate how much Marisa saves in 5 days.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.

First, we need to determine how many dollars worth of candy Billy bought with his $10:

Dollars spent on candy = Total given money - Dollars spent on gumballs
Dollars spent on candy = $10 - (0.5 * Dollars spent on gumballs)

Next, calculate the weight of the candy in pounds:

Pounds of candy = Dollars spent on candy / Price per pound of candy
Pounds of candy = ($10 - 0.5 * Dollars spent on gumballs) / $1.5

Step 2: Solve for the unknown variable.

We already have an equation for the number of pounds of candy in terms of the dollars spent on gumballs:

Pounds of candy = ($10 - 0.5 * Dollars spent on gumballs) / $1.5

From the question, we know that Billy bought 40 gumballs, and since gumballs cost $0.05 each, we can calculate the dollars spent on gumballs:

Dollars spent on gumballs = Number of gumballs * Price per gumball
Dollars spent on gumballs = 40 * $0.05
Dollars spent on gumballs = $2

Now we can find the number of pounds of candy Billy bought:

Pounds of candy = ($10 - 0.5 * $2) / $1.5

Step 3: Perform the necessary arithmetic operations.

Calculate the difference between $10 and 0.5 times $2:

$10 - 0.5 * $2 = $10 - $1 = $9

Now divide this by the price per pound of candy, $1.5:

Pounds of candy = $9 / $1.5

Step 4: Simplify the expression.

Divide the numerator by the denominator:

Pounds of candy ≈ 6

However, this value doesn't match the given information. There seems to be an error in the problem.

{The problem may contain an error or inconsistency, and it is not possible to obtain a correct answer.}</s>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2
He had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4
He spent $6 on candy because 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6
He bought 4 pounds of candy because 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4

                    Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son.  How old is ? his son, in years?
                 [/INST] let's denote Carver's age as C and his son's age as S. According to the problem, we know that:

C = 45
C = 2S - 5

We have an equation with one variable, but we need to find the value of the other variable (S). We can solve this problem by using the method of elimination.

First, let's get rid of the 'S' variable from the first equation:

C = 45

Now, let's isolate S in the second equation:

2S - 5 = C
2S = C + 5
S = (C + 5)/2

We already know that C = 45, so we can substitute this value into the equation for S:

S = (45 + 5)/2
S = 50/2
S = 25

The final answer is: Carver's son is 25 years old.</s>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one trip.
The train goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that from the third city to the first city.
So, the total distance traveled in one trip is 75 miles + 100 miles + (100 miles - 50 miles) = 225 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in one day.
Since the train makes this trip three times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 225 miles * 3 = 675 miles.

Step 3: Calculate how many days the train goes between services.
We know that the train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days go between services, we can divide the total distance the train travels in miles before getting a service by the number of miles traveled in one day.
So, the number of days between services is 18,000 miles / 675 miles = 26.83 days.

{The final answer is 27 approximately, since the train can't have a fraction of a day between services}.</s>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds step by step:

1. A Chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
2. Therefore, to make 4 Chihuahua beds, Mark will need 2 * 4 = <2 * 4 = 8> 8 pounds of stuffing for these beds.
3. A Collie bed requires an average amount of stuffing between a Chihuahua and Rottweiler bed. The difference in stuffing between a Chihuahua and Rottweiler bed is 8 pounds (for a Rottweiler bed) - 2 pounds (for a Chihuahua bed) = <8-2 = 6> 6 pounds. The Collie bed needs an additional amount of stuffing compared to a Chihuahua bed, so the total amount of stuffing for a Collie bed is 2 pounds (for a Chihuahua bed) + 6 pounds (additional stuffing) = <2+6 = 8> 8 pounds.
4. To make 3 Collie beds, Mark will need 3 * 8 = <3*8 = 24> 24 pounds of stuffing for these beds.
5. In total, Mark needs 8 pounds (for 4 Chihuahua beds) + 24 pounds (for 3 Collie beds) = <8+24 = 32> 32 pounds of stuffing to make 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds.

{The final answer is 32 pounds of stuffing.}</s>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds
Then divide the total stuffing amount by 2 to find the average stuffing amount: 10 pounds / 2 = <<10/2=5>>5 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds
Then add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds

We know that distance equals rate times time, so:
time = distance / speed

First, let's find the time it took to drive 200 miles at 70 mph:
time = 200 miles / 70 mph
time = 2.86 hours (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 2: Calculate the time it took for the detour which was an additional 10 miles.
time = 10 miles / 70 mph
time = 0.14 hours (rounded to two decimal places)

Step 3: Add up the time it took to get to his friend's house without the detour and the detour to get the total travel time.
total time = time to friend's house + detour time

Number of people kicked out for not wearing masks = 3

Next, let's find out how many people were kicked out for shoplifting. We know that the number of shoplifters is four times the number of people kicked out for not wearing masks, so:

Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * Number of people kicked out for not wearing masks
Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 4 * 3
Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = 12

Now, let's find out how many people were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We know that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for this reason, so:

Number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale = 3 * Number of people kicked out for shoplifting
Number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale = 3 * 12
Number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale = 36

We know that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. Let's check if our calculations are correct:

Total number of people kicked out = Number of people kicked out for not wearing masks + Number of people kicked out for shoplifting + Number of people kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale

Pairs sold on Friday = 14
Pairs sold on Saturday = 2 * Pairs sold on Friday
Pairs sold on Saturday = 2 * 14
Pairs sold on Saturday = 28

Step 2: Find out how many pairs were sold during the entire weekend. We know that there were 14 pairs sold on Friday, 28 pairs sold on Saturday, and we need to subtract the number of pairs returned.

Total pairs sold = Pairs sold on Friday + Pairs sold on Saturday - Pairs returned
Total pairs sold = 14 + 28 - 6

1. Hallie has dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays.
2. Therefore, her weekly dance practice time is: 1 hour (Tuesdays) + 2 hours (Thursdays) = 3 hours.
3. We know that on Saturdays, her night class lasts twice as long as Tuesday's night class.
4. Tuesday's night class lasts for 1 hour.
5. So, on Saturdays, Hallie's night class lasts for: 1 hour (Tuesday class) × 2 (twice as long) = 2 hours.

The final answer is: Hallie has dance practice for 3 hours (on Tuesdays and Thursdays) + 2 hours (on Saturdays) = 5 hours a week.</s>","She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours

                    A company bought $400000 worth of equipment from a retailer business, but ! pieces of equipment worth 40% of the total number were faulty. If they returned the faulty pieces of equipment to the seller, calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment.
Given that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty, and the total cost of the equipment was $400,000, we first need to find out the number of faulty pieces.

Let's denote the total number of pieces as X.
We know that 40% of X is the number of faulty pieces, so:

40% of X = Number of faulty pieces

To find the number of functioning pieces, we need to subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:

Number of functioning pieces = X - Number of faulty pieces

Now, we can set up an equation using the given information:

$400,000 = (0.6 * X) + ($ Cost of faulty pieces)

Step 2: Find the number of faulty pieces.
To find the number of faulty pieces, we first need to find the cost of a single faulty piece by dividing the total cost of faulty pieces by the number of faulty pieces:

Cost of a single faulty piece = $ Cost of faulty pieces / Number of faulty pieces

We know that 40% of the total pieces are faulty, so the number of faulty pieces is 40% of the total number of pieces (X):

Number of faulty pieces = 0.4 * X

Now, we can find the cost of all the faulty pieces by multiplying the number of faulty pieces by the cost per piece:

$ Cost of faulty pieces = Number of faulty pieces * Cost of a single faulty piece

Substitute the value of the number of faulty pieces into the equation:

$ Cost of faulty pieces = 0.4 * X * Cost of a single faulty piece

Now, we can find the cost of a single faulty piece:

Cost of a single faulty piece = $ Cost of faulty pieces / Number of faulty pieces
Cost of a single faulty piece = $400,000 / (0.4 * X)

Step 3: Find the total number of functioning pieces and their cost.
Now that we have the cost of a single functioning piece ($400,000 / (0.6 * X) or $250,000/X), we can find the total number of functioning pieces by subtracting the number of faulty pieces (0.4 * X) from the total number of pieces (X):

Number of functioning pieces = X - 0.4 * X = 0.6 * X

The total cost of the functioning pieces is the cost of all the pieces ($400,000) minus the cost of the faulty pieces:

$ Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - $ Cost of faulty pieces
$ Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - 0.4 * X * ($250,000/X)

Simplifying the equation:
$ Cost of functioning pieces = $400,000 - ($100,000 * X) / X
$ Cost of functioning pieces = $390,000 - ($100,000/ X)

Step 4: Determine the final answer.
Now that we have the total cost of functioning pieces, we can conclude that the company spent $390,000 on functioning pieces of equipment.

{The final answer is: The company spent $390,000 on functioning pieces of equipment.}</s>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many sheep are in each half of Mary's herd. Since she has 30 sheep in total and she divides them into two equal halves, we have:

Number of sheep in one half = Total number of sheep / 2
Number of sheep in one half = 30 / 2 = 15 sheep

Step 2: Now, we know that Mary gets 1 kg of milk from each half of her herd every day. So, we calculate the milk production from both halves:

Milk from one half = Milk per sheep * Number of sheep
Milk from one half = 1 kg * 15 = 15 kg

Step 3: To find the total milk collected every day, we add the milk production from both halves:

Total milk = Milk from both halves
Total milk = 15 kg + 15 kg = 30 kg

{The final answer is: Mary collects 30 kg of milk every day.}</s>","Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

Next, we find out how many pieces those remaining rolls were broken up into for the chickens:

Each roll was broken into 8 pieces: 6 rolls * 8 pieces/roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, {The final answer is 48 pieces}. Mrs. Sherman fed 48 pieces of rolls to the chickens.</s>","After feeding her children, Mrs. Sherman was left with 12 - 6 = <<12-6=6>>6 rolls

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

Step 1: Find the number of pupils who like blue.
Half of the class likes blue. So, the number of pupils who like blue is: (Total number of pupils) / 2 = 40 pupils / 2 = 20 pupils.

Step 2: Find the number of pupils who like green.
One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. So, the number of pupils who like green is: (Total number of pupils - Pupils who like blue) / 4.
First, find the remaining pupils: Total number of pupils = 40, Pupils who like blue = 20, So, Remaining pupils = 40 - 20 = 20 pupils.
Now, find the number of pupils who like green: Remaining pupils / 4 = 20 / 4 = 5 pupils.

Step 3: Find the number of pupils who like yellow.
Since the rest of the pupils like yellow, the number of pupils who like yellow is: Total number of pupils - Pupils who like blue - Pupils who like green = 40 - 20 - 5 = 15 pupils.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Solve for the number of apples sold on Monday.
We know that Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday and earned $56 from them. So, we need to find out how many apples she picked and sold on that day.

Let x be the number of apples Lucy picked and sold on Monday.

Equation: x * $4 = $56

To find x, we need to divide the earnings by the price per apple:

x = $56/$4 = 14 apples

{Lucy picked and sold 14 apples on Monday}

Step 2: Solve for the number of apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Now that we know how many apples Lucy picked and sold on Monday, we can find out how many apples she picked on the following days.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples, and on Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked the previous day.

Number of apples picked on Tuesday = 12 apples
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * (Number of apples picked on Tuesday)

Step 3: Find the total number of apples picked over the three days.

Total Apples = Apples picked on Monday + Apples picked on Tuesday + Apples picked on Wednesday

Total Apples = 14 apples + 12 apples + 2 * (Number of apples picked on Tuesday)

Now we need to find the number of apples picked on Wednesday. We know that it's double the number picked on Tuesday.

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 * (Number of apples picked on Tuesday)
                                                  = 2 * 12
                                                  = 24 apples

Total Apples = 14 apples + 12 apples + 24 apples

10 pairs of socks = 10 * 2 = 20 pairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of loose socks Lindsay has washed.
15 loose socks = 15

Step 3: Find the total number of socks Lindsay has washed.
Total socks washed = Pairs of socks * 2 (since a pair is 2 socks) + Loose socks
Total socks washed = 20 pairs * 2 + 15
Total socks washed = 40 + 15
Total socks washed = 55

Step 4: Subtract the number of socks Lindsay has washed from the total number of socks that need washing to find the number of socks missed.
Socks missed = Total socks needed - Socks washed
Socks missed = 50 - 55
Socks missed = -5

                 [/INST] To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the equal monthly payments for a loan of $3,650 with an interest rate of 10% over a period of 5 months. This is a standard problem for calculating loan payments using the formula for an annuity:

Payment = (Loan Amount * ((Interest Rate / 12) * Pow(1 + (Interest Rate / 12), Number of Payments))) / (1 - Pow(1 + (Interest Rate / 12), Number of Payments))

In our case, the loan amount is $3,650, the annual interest rate is 10%, which is equal to 0.10, and the number of payments is 5 * 12 = 60 (since payments are made monthly).

Payment = ($3,650 * ((0.10 / 12) * Pow(1 + (0.10 / 12), 60))) / (1 - Pow(1 + (0.10 / 12), 60))

Let's first calculate the value inside the Pow function:

1 + (Interest Rate / 12) = 1 + (0.10/12) = 1 + 0.008333 = 1.008333

Now let's calculate Pow(1.008333, 60):

Pow(1.008333, 60) ≈ 1.3399018

Now, let's calculate the Denominator:

1 - Pow(1 + (Interest Rate / 12), Number of Payments) = 1 - 1.3399018 = -0.3399018

Since we cannot have a negative denominator, this means our calculation is incorrect, and we should check for errors. One potential issue could be the loan amount. If we assume Karan borrowed $3,650 incorrectly and the actual loan amount is $3,650.00, the calculation would yield correct results:

Payment = ($3,650.00 * ((0.10 / 12) * Pow(1.008333, 60))) / (1 - Pow(1.008333, 60))

Payment ≈ $672.44

                    question:
                    Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open. If Millie sells all of ; the lemonade, how much profit will she make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many cups of lemonade Millie can make.
Millie can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. So she can make a total of: 3 pitchers * 12 cups = <3*12=36>36 cups of lemonade

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes Millie to sell all of her lemonade.
Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how long it takes for her to sell all of her lemonade, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups she sells per hour: 36 cups / 4 cups per hour = <36/4=9>9 hours

Step 3: Calculate Millie's total revenue during this time.
Millie sells each cup for $1, so her revenue per hour is $1 * 4 cups = $<1*4=4>4 per hour. Since it takes 9 hours to sell all of her lemonade, her total revenue is $<4*9=36>36.

Step 4: Determine Millie's total cost.
Millie spends $18 on supplies to make 36 cups of lemonade.

Step 5: Calculate Millie's profit.
Subtract Millie's total cost from her total revenue to find her profit: $<36-18=18>18 per hour.

{The final answer is: Millie makes a profit of $<18>18 per hour.}</s>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.
Her total profit for selling the lemonade is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.
It will take Millie 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours of work to sell all of the lemonade.
Her hourly profit is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 ; of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?
                 [/INST] To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to find out how much land he sold, which is given as 3/5 of his land. Let's call the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first ""x"".

We know that he sold 3/5 of his land, leaving him with 12.8 hectares. So we can set up the equation:

x - 3/5x = 12.8

To solve for x, first subtract 3/5x from both sides of the equation:

-3/5x = -12.8

Next, multiply both sides by -5 to make the x term positive:

5(-3/5x) = 5*-12.8

Multiply -3/5 by 5 on the left side to get 15/1 as the multiplier:

15/1 * x = 64

Multiply both sides by 1/15 to isolate x:

x = 64 * 1/15

Simplify the fraction:

x = 16

So {The final answer is that Mr. Ruther had 16 hectares of land at first.}

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 16 hectares of land at first.</s>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

How many people sang in the performance?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, the choir has 52 members.
2. Half of them are boys (50% * 52 = 26 boys), and half are girls (50% * 52 = 26 girls).
3. Therefore, the choir originally had 26 boys + 26 girls = 52 members.
4. However, half of them couldn't make it to the show due to the bus breaking down, which means 26 people couldn't attend.
5. This leaves us with a total of 52 (originally in the choir) - 26 (who couldn't come) = 26 people who actually attended the performance.
6. However, the teachers also joined, and there were 3 teachers in total.
7. So, the number of people who sang in the performance is 26 (original attendees) + 3 (teachers) = 29 people.

{The final answer is 29 people sang in the performance.}</s>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

                 [/INST] To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we first need to determine how many popsicles each of them has based on their ratio.

1. We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165.
2. Their ratio is 5:6, which can be represented as parts A:B, where A represents Betty's portion and B represents Sam's portion.
3. Let x be the number of popsicles Betty has, then Sam would have x + δ, where δ represents the difference in the number of popsicles between them.
4. Following the 5:6 ratio, we have:

   5x = 5 parts for Betty
   6x = 6 parts for Sam

5. To find out the actual number of popsicles based on their ratio, we divide each part by its respective ratio:

   x (Betty's popsicles) = 5 parts * (Total popsicles) / 5 parts = 135
   x + δ (Sam's popsicles) = 6 parts * (Total popsicles) / 6 parts = 141.66

6. However, we cannot have a fraction of a popsicle. Since the total number of popsicles is a multiple of their ratio, the difference between their popsicles should also be a multiple of their ratio.
7. To make Sam's difference a multiple of their ratio, we can increase his portion by the smallest possible number such that the difference is a multiple of their ratio. Based on their ratio difference (1 popsicle for every 1.2 parts), we can increase Sam's portion by 2 units in order for the difference to be a multiple of their ratio.
8. So, the updated values for their popsicles would be:

   x (Betty's popsicles) = 135
   x + δ (Sam's popsicles) = 137

9. Therefore, Sam has δ = 2 additional popsicles more than Betty.

* Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.
* She spends half as much time recording, so that's 2 hours (4 hours * 0.5).
* She spends 90 minutes editing, which is equivalent to 1.5 hours (90 minutes / 60 minutes/hour).

So her total work time is:

Total work time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours
Total work time = 7.5 hours

Now we can find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing:

Percentage of editing time = (Editing time / Total work time) * 100%
Percentage of editing time = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100%

To calculate this fraction, we can also subtract the writing and recording time from the total work time and then divide the editing time by that difference:

Percentage of editing time = ((7.5 hours - 4 hours - 2 hours) / 7.5 hours) * 100%
Percentage of editing time = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100%

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Erica made 20 cards herself.

Step 2: Her dad brought her 2 boxes, each containing 15 cards. So, her dad gave her a total of 15 x 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 cards.

Step 3: Erica passed out a total of 20 (self-made) + 24 (received from her dad) = <<20+24=44>>44 cards to her classmates and family.

Step 4: She received a total of 5 (to her family) + 17 (from family and friends) = <<5+17=22>>22 cards.

Step 5: To find the total number of cards Erica now has, we add the cards she made, the cards her dad gave her, and the cards she received.

The final answer is: Erica now has 20 (self-made) + 30 (given by her dad) + 22 (received from family and friends) = <<20+30+22=72>>72 Valentine's Day cards.</s>","Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30
She made 20, was given 30 and received 17 so 20+30+17 = <<20+30+17=67>>67 cards
She passed out 24 and gave 5 cards to family and friends so she gave away 24+5 = <<24+5=29>>29 cards
She had 67 cards and gave away 29 cards so 67-29 = <<67-29=38>>38 cards left

                 [/INST] Step 1: Jenny gives Bill 1/3 of the pizza, so she keeps 2/3 for herself. She gives Mark 1/4 of the pizza, so she keeps 11/4 for herself.

Step 2: Jenny eats 2 slices, so she has consumed 2 slices * 1 = 2.

Step 3: To find out how many slices are left, we add the number of slices Jenny gave to Bill and Mark, subtract the number of slices Jenny kept for herself, and add the number of slices she ate:

Slices remaining = Initial number of slices - Jenny's share - Bill's share - Mark's share + Jenny's eaten slices

Step 4: Let's calculate the initial number of slices: 12 slices in total, so the equation for the remaining slices becomes:

Slices remaining = 12 - (1/3 * 12) - (1/4 * 12) + 2

Step 5: Calculate Jenny's share, Bill's share, and Mark's share:

Jenny's share = 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices
Bill's share = 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices
Mark's share = 1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

Step 6: Plug the values back into the equation:

Slices remaining = 12 - 4 - 3 + 2

Step 7: Simplify the equation:

Slices remaining = 12 - 7

Step 8: The final answer is: 5 slices are left.</s>","First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices
Do the same thing to find how many slices 1/4 of the pizza is: 12 slices * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 slices
Then subtract the slices each of the three people ate to find the remaining number of slices: 12 slices - 4 slices - 3 slices - 2 slices = <<12-4-3-2=3>>3 slices

Then, we can divide that difference by his daily income to find out how many days it will take him to save that amount.

Step 1: Find the amount Mark needs to save
The bike costs $300

Step 2: Find the amount Mark currently has saved
Mark has $50 in his bank account

Step 3: Find the difference between the amount Mark needs to save and the amount he currently has saved
$300 (amount needed) - $50 (amount saved) = $255

Step 4: Find out how many days it will take Mark to save $255
$255 (amount to be saved) / $10 (daily income) = 25.5 days

Since Mark can't save half a day, he will need to save for another day to reach the full amount.

Step 5: Calculate the number of days Mark needs to save for
$255 (amount to be saved) / $10 (daily income) + 1 = 26 days

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.
2. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, so that would be 90 * (1/3) = 30. Therefore, she saw 30 millipedes.
3. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, the number of stink bugs would be 2 * 30 - 12 = 54.
4. To find the total number of bugs she counted, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs: 90 (spiders) + 30 (millipedes) + 54 (stink bugs) = {174}.

Step 1: Find out how many days the builder works in a year.
- He works for 4 weeks every month.
- There are 4.33 weeks in a year (approximately).
- He works for 6 days every week.

Number of days worked in a year = (Weeks per year) × (Days per week)

1. Quadruple batch of brownies needs:
- Four times the amount of flour in the original recipe: 3 cups × 4 = 12 cups = 6 bags of 2 cups each
- Four times the amount of milk in the original recipe: 1 cup × 4 = 4 cups = 2 bottles of 2 cups each

Thus, Mark needs to buy:

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many watts of energy Mel uses per hour when he operates the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
Watts used per hour = Total watts * (Hours used / Total hours) = 900 watts * (8 hours / 24 hours) = 3600 watts / 24 hours = 1429 watts (approximately)

Step 2: Mel now operates the air conditioner for only 3 hours a day. So, the number of hours he saves is 5 hours a day. To find out how many watts of energy he saves per hour, we'll use the same formula.
Watts saved per hour = Watts used before * (Hours saved / Total hours) = 1429 watts * (5 hours / 24 hours) = 645.83 watts (approximately)

Step 3: To find the total energy saved per day, we'll multiply the watts saved per hour by the number of saved hours in a day (24 hours).
Energy saved per day = Watts saved per hour * Hours saved = 645.83 watts * 24 hours = 15,539.92 watt-hours

Step 4: To find the total energy saved in 30 days, we'll multiply the daily energy saved by the number of days.

Energy saved in 30 days = Energy saved per day * Number of days = 15,539.92 watt-hours * 30 days = 466,197.6 watt-hours

The final answer is that Mel saves approximately 466,197.6 watt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.</s>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

1) N = 2C (There is twice as much corn as cannolis)
2) N = 40 (Allan has 40 cannolis in his house initially)

From the first equation, we know that C = N/2. Substituting C with N/2 in the second equation, we get:

N = 40 => C = N/2 => C = 40/2 => C = 20

So, Allan initially had 20 corns and 40 cannolis in his house.

Now, Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns:

New number of cannolis = N + 60
New number of corns = C - 40

We already know that C = 20, so:

New number of corns = 20 - 40 = -20

                 [/INST] To find the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we first need to determine how many steps he took to and from school and with his friend.

1. Elliott finished half of his steps at school: He wants to take 10,000 steps a day. Half of that is 5,000 steps. So, Elliott took 5,000 steps to and from school.

2. Elliott took an additional 1,000 steps with his friend: So far, Elliott has taken 6,000 steps (5,000 from school + 1,000 with his friend).

3. Elliott has 2,000 steps left: We know that Elliott had 8,000 steps total (5,000 from school + 1,000 with his friend + mystery steps from jog) and he took 6,000 steps already, so there should be 2,000 steps left for the jog.

{The final answer is: Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.}</s>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 , minutes to get : to the airport. How many minutes early ? will Toby be?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book.
We know that the book is 45 pages long and each page has an average of 200 words. Therefore:
Total number of words =Pages × Words per page
Total number of words =45 pages ×200 words/page
Total number of words =9000 words

Step 2: Calculate how long it takes Toby to read the entire book.
We know that Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, to find out how long it takes him to read the whole book, we need to divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
Time =Total number of words/Words per minute
Time =9000 words/300 words/minute
Time =30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how long it takes Toby to get to the airport.
We know that it takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.

Step 4: Find out how early Toby will arrive at the airport.
We know that Toby plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book and it takes him 30 minutes to read it. The total time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport is:
Total time =Reading time + Travel time
Total time =30 minutes (reading) +10 minutes (travel)
Total time =40 minutes

Since Toby has 60 minutes before his flight, and he will spend 40 minutes getting to the airport and finishing the book, he will be 20 minutes early.
{The final answer is: Toby will be 20 minutes early.}</s>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5

He will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40
He will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20

                 [/INST] Step 1: In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

First, let's calculate the total number of hours worked by all the employees in May:
40 employees * 40 hours/week * 4 weeks = 16000 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total amount paid to all the employees in May based on hourly wage:
16000 hours * $15/hour = $240,000.

Step 2: In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. That means 10 employees left the company.

Step 3: The company continued to pay the same hourly wages to the remaining employees. We don't have information about the total hours worked by the employees in June.

Step 4: To calculate the total amount paid to the employees in June, we need to know the total number of hours worked. Since we don't have that information, we cannot calculate the total amount paid to the employees in June.

Therefore, we can only find the total amount paid to the employees in May:

{The final answer is $240,000.}</s>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000

How much money does Sally have left?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the taffy that Sally bought.
Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy, and each pound cost $3 with a buy-one-get-one-free offer. So the total cost of the taffy is:
2 pounds * $3/pound = $6

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells.
The cost of the mixed bag of seashells was $1.50.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the magnets.
Sally bought 4 magnets, and each magnet cost $0.25. So the total cost of the magnets is:
4 magnets * $0.25/magnet = $1

Step 4: Find the total amount Sally spent on the taffy, seashells, and magnets.
Total spent = $6 (for taffy) + $1.50 (for seashells) + $1 (for magnets) = $8.50

Step 5: Find out how much money Sally had initially and how much is left.
Sally started with $10. She spent $8.50, so she has:
$10 - $8.50 = $1.50

{The final answer is $1.50.}</s>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find the cost of the second package of fireworks. We know that it costs twice as much as the first package, so:
Cost of second package = 2 * Cost of first package
Cost of first package = $400

Step 2: Substitute the cost of the first package into the equation to find the cost of the second package:
Cost of second package = 2 * $400
Cost of second package = $800

Step 3: Now we have the cost of both packages without the discount. To find the total cost with the discount, we need to calculate the discounted price for each package separately and then add them together:

Discounted price of first package = Cost of first package * (1 - Discount rate)
Discounted price of first package = $400 * (1 - 0.20)
Discounted price of first package = $320

Discounted price of second package = Cost of second package * (1 - Discount rate)
Discounted price of second package = $800 * (1 - 0.20)
Discounted price of second package = $640

Step 4: Add the discounted prices of both packages to find the total amount spent by Tim:
Total amount spent = Discounted price of first package + Discounted price of second package
Total amount spent = $320 + $640
Total amount spent = $960

But we missed the finale firework that costs $150. So, we need to add that to our total amount spent:
Total amount spent = $960 + $150
Total amount spent = $1,110 {The final answer is $1,110}</s>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800
So the two packages were worth 400+800=$<<400+800=1200>>1200
That means he got a discount of 1200*.2=$<<1200*.2=240>>240
So the packages cost 1200-240=$<<1200-240=960>>960
So he spent a total of 960+150=$<<960+150=1110>>1110

1. First, let's find out how many cookies Shannon needs for 30 days:
   Cookies needed = Number of cookies per day * Number of days
   Cookies needed = 2 cookies/day * 30 days
   Cookies needed = 60 cookies

2. Next, we need to convert the number of cookies to dozens:
   Dozens needed = Cookies needed / Cookies per dozen
   Dozens needed = 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen
   Dozens needed = 5 dozens + 0.5 dozens

The final answer is: Shannon needs to make 6 dozens (6.0 > 5.5, so she rounds up to 6) of madeleine cookies to have enough for 30 days.</s>","She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies

                 [/INST] To find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we first need to determine the number of candles that have each defect separately, and then find the overlap.

1. First, we need to find the number of candles that have the defect of smelling like wet dog (5% of 50000):
   Number of candles with wet dog smell = Percentage of candles with wet dog smell * Total number of candles
   = 0.05 * 50000
   = 2500
   {The number of candles that smell like wet dog is 2500}.

2. Next, we need to find the number of candles that will explode (assuming an unknown percentage). Let's call this percentage 'x'.
   Number of candles with explosion defect = Percentage of candles with explosion defect *Total number of candles
   = x * 50000

3. However, we know that Marcy claims her candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, which means that less than 1% will explode. So, we have the inequality:  x < 1 % of 50000
   
    Translating this inequality to a percentage, we have x < 50
    So the maximum number of candles that will explode is 50
    {The maximum number of candles that explode is 50}.

4. Finally, we need to find the number of candles that have both defects. This will be the minimum of the two separate defects:
   Number of candles with both defects = Min(Number of candles with wet dog smell, Number of candles with explosion defect)
   = Min(2500, 50)
   = 50
   {The final answer is that at most 50 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode}.</s>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

Discounted price of one blouse = Regular price * (1 - Discount rate)
Discounted price of one blouse = $20 * (1 - 0.3)
Discounted price of one blouse = $20 * 0.7
Discounted price of one blouse = $14

Next, we need to find the total cost of the four discounted blouses. To do this, we multiply the discounted price of one blouse by the number of blouses Misha bought:

Total cost = Discounted price per blouse * Number of blouses
Total cost = $14 * 4

If the ? sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?
                 [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, and half that amount from the shortest trees. So, she gathers 15 apples from the shortest trees.
2. We're told her sister gathers twice as many apples as Joanne from the tallest trees, which is 2 * 30 = 60 apples. She gathers 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees, which is 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
3. Combined, the sisters have gathered 30 (Joanne's apples from tall trees) + 15 (Joanne's apples from short trees) + 60 (sister's apples from tall trees) + 45 (sister's apples from short trees) = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.
4. They have a combined total of 500 apples. Therefore, the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that:
C + D = 180 (total number of heads)
2C + D = 304 (total number of humps)

Step 2: Now let's solve these equations for C and D.
First, subtract the first equation from the second one: (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
This simplifies to: C = 124 (number of camels)

Step 3: Now we plug this value back into the first equation to find D:
124 + D = 180
Subtract 124 from both sides: D = 56 (number of dromedaries)

{The final answer is: The herd has 124 camels and 56 dromedaries.}</s>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180

Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days, so the distance he covered during this time is: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Find the distance Tom traveled during the next 2 days.
He traveled 30% of the distance he covered during the first 4 days, so: 0.3 * 800 km = 240 km

                 [/INST] To find the size of Timothy's locker, we need to use the given information to find a series of ratios and apply them to Peter's locker size. Here's how:

1. We know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker.
2. We also know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.

First, let's find the ratio of Timothy's locker to Zack's locker:
1:1/2 = 2:1

Now, let's use this ratio to find the size of Zack's locker relative to Timothy's locker. To do this, we can multiply the locker sizes in the given ratio:

Timothy's locker = 1
Zack's locker = 1 * 1/2 = 1/2

Now, we know that Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker:

Zack's locker = 1/2
Peter's locker = 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8

Since Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation to find the size of Timothy's locker:

1/8 = x/Timothy's locker size

To find Timothy's locker size, we need to cross-multiply:

1 * Timothy's locker size = 8 * 1/8
Timothy's locker size = 1 * 8 = 8

Thus, {The final answer is: Timothy's locker is 8 cubic inches}.</s>","Zack's locker is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 cubic inches.

Let x = the amount of money Mr. Josue received from the second bank.

According to the problem, we know that:

1) Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank.
2) He received twice as much money from the second bank, so he received x = 2 * ($4000) = $8000 from the second bank.
3) Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital.

Now we can find the total amount of capital Mr. Josue has now:

Total capital = Initial capital + Money from the first bank + Money from the second bank
Total capital = $5000 + $4000 + $8000
Total capital = $17000

1. Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
2. Four boats carried away 5 cats each, so 5 x 4 = 20 cats were taken away.
   {50 - 20 = 30 cats are left on the rock}
3. Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse, so we need to find 3/5 of 30.
   To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is the same as multiplying 30 by 3 and then dividing the result by 5.
   So, 30 x 3 = 90, and 90 / 5 = 18.
4. Therefore, 18 cats were left after chasing the mouse.

                 [/INST] To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to find the original price of each type of jeans and the total savings that Cole made. Let's denote:

x = original price of the tattered jeans
y = original price of the jogger jeans
s = total savings

According to the problem, we know that:

x - $28 = cost of the tattered jeans purchased
y - (x - $6) = cost of the jogger jeans purchased
$6 = total savings

We can rearrange these equations to find the relationship between the original prices:

x = $28 + cost of tattered jeans
y = x - $6 + cost of jogger jeans

From the problem, it's given that Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, the amount he saved from the tattered jeans was:

amount saved in tattered jeans = $6 * 2/3 = $4

The original price of the tattered jeans was:

x = $28 + $4 = $32

Since the jogger jeans were $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can now find the original price of the jogger jeans:

y = x - $6 = $32 - $6 = $26

Therefore, the final answer is: The jogger jeans originally cost $4 more than the tattered jeans.</s>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.

Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28

The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. The bagel costs $4, so we'll find 25% of $4 to determine the cost of the soup.

25% of $4 = $1 (0.25 x $4 = $1)

So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel.
Cost of soup = $1 + $4 = $5

Step 2: Find the cost of the cake.
The cake is half the price of the bagel.

Cost of cake = $4 (half of $4 is $2, but since the question says ""piece of cake,"" it may imply a whole cake, which would cost $4)

While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half ! of the guests to be : able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted : a second hotdog. How many guests did not get a second hotdog?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of hotdogs prepared for each guest.
The caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two. So, each guest would have gotten 2 hotdogs if there were half the number of guests at the event.

Number of guests = 36
Hotdogs per guest (if each person had only one) = 1
Hotdogs per guest (with two hotdogs each) = 2

We know that the caterer prepared enough hotdogs for half of the guests to have two, so:

2 * Number of guests (half of the total) = Total number of hotdogs
2 * (1/2 * 36) = Total number of hotdogs

Calculation: 2 * (18) = 36 * 2 = 72

So, the caterer prepared 72 hotdogs in total.

Step 2: Determine how many hotdogs were consumed.
Each guest consumed 2 hotdogs, and there were 36 guests:

Hotdogs consumed = 2 * Number of guests
Hotdogs consumed = 2 * 36 = 72 hotdogs

Since the exact number of hotdogs was consumed, there are no hotdogs left for further servings.

Step 3: Calculate the number of guests who consumed two hotdogs.
Since each guest consumed 2 hotdogs, and there were 36 guests, there were no leftovers for other guests.

The number of guests who consumed two hotdogs is equal to the total number of guests.

Step 4: Analyze the situation with 40 guests showing up.
40 guests showed up but only 36 were catered for. Out of these 40 guests, 36 consumed two hotdogs each. So, there were no hotdogs left for the remaining 4 guests.

The final answer is: 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.</s>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.

1. Indras' name has 6! letters, where !! represents factorial, meaning the product of all positive integers up to that number. We can find the number of letters using a calculator or by computing it manually. 

   Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
   Total number of factors: 7
   Thus, 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720
   However, since there are two Rs in Indras' name, we need to divide the result by 2! to correct the double count.
   ∴ Indras' name has 720 ÷ 2 = 360 letters. {1}

2. Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name.

   Half of Indras' name: 360 ÷ 2 = 180 letters
   Her sister's name has 180 + 4 = 184 letters. {2}

{The final answer is Indras' name has 360 letters, and her sister's name has 184 letters.}</s>","I = <<6=6>>6
Sister = 6/2 + 4 = <<6/2+4=7>>7

- Cost of pot and pans: $120.00
- Cost of mixing bowls: $20.00
- Cost of 5 utensils: $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price for each item. (20% off)
- Discounted price of pot and pans: $120.00 * 0.8 = $96.00
- Discounted price of mixing bowls: $20.00 * 0.8 = $16.00
- Discounted price of each utensil: $5.00 * 0.8 = $4.00
- Total cost of utensils after discount: $4.00 * 5 = $20.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the order after the discount.
Total cost = Discounted price of pot and pans + Discounted price of mixing bowls + Total cost of utensils

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.
Cost of skipping rope = $6
Cost of board game = $11
Cost of playground ball = $2

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Dora has spent so far.
Money spent = Cost of skipping rope + Cost of board game + Cost of playground ball

                 [/INST] To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needs, we first need to determine how many gallons are in one container and then calculate how many pints are in 1/4 of a container.

1. Since the gas was equally divided into 5 containers, we can find the number of gallons in one container by dividing the total amount of gas by the number of containers.

Gallons in one container = Total gallons / Number of containers
Gallons in one container = 15 gallons / 5 containers
Gallons in one container = 3 gallons

2. Next, we need to convert gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon equals 128 pints, so 3 gallons would be:

Pints in one container = Gallons in one container * Pints per gallon
Pints in one container = 3 gallons * 128 pints/gallon
Pints in one container = 384 pints

3. Finally, we can calculate how many pints are in 1/4 of a container.

Pints in 1/4 of a container = Pints in one container / 4
Pints in 1/4 of a container = 384 pints / 4

The final answer is: 96 pints.

Therefore, Josey needed 96 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.</s>","15 gallons = 120 pints

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. First, let's find out how many bags of chips George bought with $5. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, so:
   - Number of chips bags = Total amount spent / Cost per chips bag
   - Number of chips bags = $5 / $0.40
   - Number of chips bags = 12.5
   Since George can't buy half a bag of chips, we round down to the nearest whole number. So George bought 12 bags of chips.

2. We know that the total amount of money George spent was $5, and after buying chips, 1% of his money was left. Let's denote the amount of money spent on candy bars as ""x"".
   Then, the amount of money George spent on chips is $5 - x.

3. The cost of 12 bags of chips is $12 (12 * $0.40). So, the difference between the total amount of money George spent and the cost of chips is the amount he spent on candy bars: $5 - $12 - x = 0.
   Rearrange the equation: x + $12 + $5 = $12.
   Simplify: x = -$7.
   Since you can't spend a negative amount of money, there's an inconsistency in the problem. It's not possible for George to have spent $5 on both 12 bags of chips and an number of candy bars based on the information given. {The answer is: This problem is inconsistent.}</s>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05
George spent $4.95 because 5 - .05 = <<5-.05=4.95>>4.95

George spent 3.75 on candy bars because 4.95 - 1.2 = <<4.95-1.2=3.75>>3.75
George bought 5 candy bars because 3.75 / .75 = <<5=5>>5

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many lollipops Ray kept for himself. We know that he started with 25 lollipops and gave 5 to himself, so:

Ray's lollipops = Initial lollipops - Self-kept lollipops
Ray's lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

Step 2: Ray gave the remaining lollipops equally to his four friends. So, the number of lollipops each friend received is the division of the Ray's lollipops by the number of friends:

Lollipops per friend = Total Lollipops / Number of Friends
Lollipops per friend = 20 / 4

Step 3: To find the exact number of lollipops, we calculate the division:

Lollipops per friend = 5

{The final answer is: Each friend received 5 lollipops.}

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the number of lollipops Ray has left and the number of lollipops each friend should get. To clarify this, let's double-check the given information. Can you please confirm that Ray started with 25 lollipops and gave 5 away, leaving him with 20? If that's the case, then each friend did indeed receive five lollipops.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how much each piece weighs.
Total weight of the cake is 20 pounds. Since there are 8 pieces, the weight of each piece is the total weight divided by the number of pieces:

Weight of one piece = Total weight / Number of pieces
Weight of one piece = 20 pounds / 8
Weight of one piece = 2.5 pounds

Step 2: Determine the weight of the pieces eaten by Rory and her mom.
Since each person had one piece, the weight of the pieces they ate is the weight of one piece:

Weight of pieces eaten = 2 * Weight of one piece
Weight of pieces eaten = 2 * 2.5 pounds
Weight of pieces eaten = 5 pounds

Step 3: Find the weight of the remaining cake.
The weight of the remaining cake is the total weight of the cake minus the weight of the pieces eaten:

Remaining weight = Total weight - Weight of pieces eaten
Remaining weight = 20 pounds - 5 pounds
Remaining weight = 15 pounds

{The final answer is: The remaining cake weighs 15 pounds.}</s>","Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.
If Rory and her mom each have a slice, they will have eaten 2.5 ounces + 2.5 ounces = <<2.5+2.5=5>>5 ounces.

Step 1: Find the total number of oranges.
Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges, so they have a total of:
34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris' oranges) = 56 oranges

Step 2: Divide the total number of oranges by the number of people they want to share with.
Sitti and Juris want to share the oranges with 6 other friends each, so there are a total of:
Total number of people = 2 (Sitti and Juris) + 6 (friends) = 8 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges each person will get.
Number of oranges per person = Total number of oranges / Total number of people
Number of oranges per person = 56 / 8
Number of oranges per person = 7 with a remainder of 2 when divided by 8

Since there are no fractions of an orange, everyone will get 7 oranges each, and there will be 2 oranges left over, which they can keep for themselves or share among the group in any way they choose.

{The final answer is: everyone will get 7 oranges, with 2 oranges left over.}</s>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?
                 [/INST] To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we first need to determine the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. We know that the drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes, and the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long.

Let x be the number of minutes it takes Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, we have:

x = 4 * 4 = 16 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to find out what time Wayne will arrive at the theater. Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get there, he will arrive:

Wayne's arrival time = Current time + 4 minutes

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she should arrive:

Bernadette's arrival time = Current time + (4 minutes - 5 minutes)
Bernadette's arrival time = Current time - 1 minute

Now we have two equations, one for Wayne's arrival time and one for Bernadette's arrival time:

1) Wayne's arrival time = Current time + 4 minutes
2) Bernadette's arrival time = Current time - 1 minute

We want to find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, which is the difference between their departure times. Let y be the number of minutes earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne. Then we have:

Current time + 4 minutes (Wayne) = Current time + y + 4 minutes (Bernadette)

Subtracting Current time from both sides and simplifying, we get:

y = -4 minutes + 4 minutes (Bernadette's drive) - 1 minute (Bernadette's early arrival)

y = 3 minutes (since 4 minutes (Bernadette's drive) - 1 minute (Bernadette's early arrival) = 3 minutes)

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 3 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first.

{The final answer is: Bernadette should leave 3 minutes earlier than Wayne.}</s>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.

                 [/INST] To find the perimeter of a rectangular room given its length and area, we can use the following formula:

Perimeter = 2 × (Length × 52.83 feet/yard + Width)

We are given the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards). To solve for the perimeter, we first need to find the width.

Step 1: Find the width.
Area = Length × Width
360 square feet = 3 yards × Width

First, we need to convert the length from yards to square feet since the area is given in square feet:

3 yards × 52.83 feet/yard = 158.5 yards²

Now we can solve for the width:

360 square feet = 158.5 yards² × Width

Divide both sides by 158.5 yards²:

Width = 360 square feet / 158.5 yards²
Width = 2.23 yards

Step 2: Find the perimeter using the formula.

Perimeter = 2 × (Length × 52.83 feet/yard + Width)
          = 2 × (3 yards × 52.83 feet/yard + 2.23 yards)

First, convert the length and width to square feet:

3 yards × 52.83 feet/yard = 158.5 yards²
2.23 yards = 2.23 yards × 52.83 feet/yard = 118.44 feet

How many more beads do one . sister , have than the other, if , each pack of : beads contains 20 pieces of ; beads?
                 [/INST] Let's calculate the number of beads each sister purchased:

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads: 1 * number of pieces in a pack = 1 * 20 = 20 red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads: 2 * number of pieces in a pack = 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads
- Total beads for Elizabeth: 20 red + 40 clear = 60 beads

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads: 3 * number of pieces in a pack = 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads: 4 * number of pieces in a pack = 4 * 20 = 80 red beads
- Total beads for Margareth: 60 blue + 80 red = 140 beads

To find the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:

140 beads (Margareth) - 60 beads (Elizabeth) = 80 beads difference

{The final answer is: Elizabeth has 80 fewer beads than Margareth.}</s>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.

So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Step 2: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature of the house by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature rise due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees. {The house's temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees}.

Step 3: Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes. Let's convert this to hours: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours. During this time, the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes, which is equivalent to 2 degrees/_10 minutes * 0.5 hours / 0.1 hours/_minute = 3 degrees. {The house's temperature after opening the window is 55 degrees - 3 degrees = 52 degrees}.

                    question:
                    Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the , bike ride and 50 minutes for the run. :  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes : longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did : it take James to do the run?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the individual times for James in the swim and bike segments.
Since Jon takes 40 minutes for the swim and James finishes 10% faster, we can calculate James' swim time as follows:
{40 minutes * 1.10 = 44 minutes}

For the bike segment, Jon takes 1 hour and 20 minutes, or 80 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer, so his bike time is:
{80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes}

Step 2: Determine the difference between their total times.
The difference between Jon's and James' total times is 10 minutes. Let's calculate their total times:
Jon's total time: 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
James' total time: 44 minutes (swim) + 85 minutes (bike) + : time (run)

Step 3: Solve for James' run time.
We know the difference between their total times is 10 minutes. So we have:
170 minutes (Jon) - 44 minutes (James, swim) - 85 minutes (James, bike) = 10 minutes
:{10 minutes = James' run time}
However, this doesn't make sense, as the James' run time should be greater than 10 minutes to account for the difference in bike times. Let's check the problem to make sure we have all the information correctly. If we see that the 10-minute difference is for other reasons, we can try another approach:

Step 4: Adjust the difference in bike times.
Let's assume the given information about Jon winning by 10 minutes is actually the difference between their swim times. In that case, James may only have a 5-minute disadvantage on the bike segment.
To find James' run time with this new assumption:
Jon's total time: 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes
James' total time: 36 minutes (swim, 10% faster) + 85 minutes (bike, 5 minutes longer) + time (run)
{170 minutes (Jon) = 36 minutes (James, swim) + 90 minutes (James, bike) + time (James, run)}
Subtracting James' swim and bike times:
{time (James, run) = 170 minutes (Jon) - 36 minutes (James, swim) - 90 minutes (James, bike)}
{time (James, run) = 44 minutes}

The final answer is: James takes 44 minutes to do the run.</s>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes

So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180

2. We're also told that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, and Movie C is 1.25 hours long. So, the length of Movie B is x = 1.25 + 5 = 1.3 hours.

3. We found the length of Movie B, which is 1.3 hours or 80 minutes (since 1.3 hours * 60 minutes equals 80 minutes). The length of Movie A is x/4 = 80/4 = 20 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance his horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 MPH.
2. Determine how much hay his horse consumes based on that distance.
3. Calculate the cost of the hay.
4. Subtract the cost of the hay from the amount of money Michael has.

Let's begin:

1. First, we need to convert the running time of 30 minutes to miles. We know that 1 mile is travelled in 5 minutes at a speed of 32 MPH. So, 30 minutes is equal to 6 miles (30 minutes * (1 mile/5 minutes)).

2. Now, since the horse consumes 1/2 bale of hay for every mile it runs, the horse consumes 3 bales of hay during a 6-mile run (6 miles * 1/2 bale/mile).

3. The cost of a bale of hay is $3, so the total cost of the hay for Michael is 3 * $3 = $9.

4. Michael starts with six $5 bills, so the total amount of money he has is 6 * $5 = $30. After buying the $9 worth of hay, Michael has $30 - $9 = $21 left as change.

{The final answer is $21}</s>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many eggs Rozanne used in total.
- She used 4 dozens of eggs which is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.
- She also used 2 loose eggs.
- So, in total, she used 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Step 2: Next, we need to determine how many glasses of eggnog each tray can hold. We know that each glass holds 5 eggs, and that each tray holds 5 glasses, so:

- The number of eggs in one glass = 5
- The number of glasses in one tray = 5
- The number of eggs in one tray = The number of eggs in one glass * The number of glasses in one tray = 5 eggs/glass * 5 glasses/tray = 25 eggs/tray

Step 3: Now, we can find out how many trays Rozanne can put out by determining how many trays are needed to hold all the eggs she used:

- The number of eggs Rozanne used = 50 eggs
- To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the number of eggs by the number of eggs in one tray: 
{The final answer is:} 50 eggs / 25 eggs/tray = 2 trays (with some eggs left over)

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog, but she will have some eggs left over that cannot be used in eggnog.</s>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

Step 2: To find Joey's current points, we add the number of points he scored during his turn to his previous score:
Joey's points after his turn = 214 (previous points) + 26 (points scored)

Step 3: We can calculate Joey's current points by adding the number of points he scored to his previous points:
Joey's points after his turn = 214 + 26 = 240

Step 4: Now, we need to find out how many points Marcy scored during her turn. We know that Marcy had 225 points before her turn, and then she scored an additional 10 points.

Marcy's points after her turn = 225 (previous points) + 10 (points scored)

Step 6: To find the difference in points between Joey and Marcy, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points:
Difference in points = Joey's points - Marcy's points
Difference in points = 240 (Joey's points) - 225 (Marcy's points)

First, let's find the cost of buying a movie ticket and the two separate items.
Movie ticket = $12
Popcorn (separate) + Soda (regular price) = $1 savings + $3 soda + ? popcorn

Since the person saved $2 when buying the movie super ticket instead of buying a movie ticket and the two items separately, the total cost of buying the popcorn and soda separately is $1 more than the cost of the popcorn alone. Let's denote the price of a popcorn as x.

Popcorn (separate) + Soda (regular price) = x + $1

However, we know that the cost of a popcorn and a soda together when buying the movie super ticket is $1 less than the cost of the super ticket.

$20 (movie super ticket) = Popcorn (super ticket) + Soda (super ticket) + $1
$20 = x (popcorn) + Soda (super ticket) + $1

Since the person didn't save any money on the soda when buying the movie super ticket, the cost of a soda from the super ticket must be $3.

Soda (super ticket) = $3

Now, we can find the price of a popcorn by solving for x in the first equation:

x + $1 = $21 (the total cost of the movie super ticket minus the cost of the soda)
x = $20 - $1 - $3
x = $17

Therefore, the regular price of a popcorn is $17.

                    A car is on a road ? trip and drives 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. What is the . car's average speed in mph during this trip?
                 [/INST] To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to first find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, then divide the total distance by the total time.

First, let's find the distance traveled during each part of the trip. The car travels 60 mph for 2 hours, so the distance covered during the first part of the trip is:

Distance1 = Speed1 * Time1
Distance1 = 60 mph * 2 hours
Distance1 = 120 miles

Next, the car travels 30 mph for 1 hour, so the distance covered during the second part of the trip is:

Distance2 = Speed2 * Time2
Distance2 = 30 mph * 1 hour
Distance2 = 30 miles

The total distance traveled during the entire trip is:

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles

The total time taken during the entire trip is:

Total Time = Time1 + Time2
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours

To find the average speed during the entire trip, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours

Simplify the fraction:

Average Speed = 50 mph

{The final answer is 50 mph.}</s>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

1. Calculate the volume of soil needed for one raised bed:
   volume of one raised bed = length × width × height
   = 8 feet × 2 feet × 2 feet
   = 16 cubic feet

2. Calculate the total volume of soil needed for all raised beds:
   total volume = number of raised beds × volume of one raised bed
   = 10 beds × 16 cubic feet/bed
   = 160 cubic feet

3. Calculate the number of bags needed:
   number of bags = total volume / volume of one bag
   = 160 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
   = 80 bags

4. Calculate the total cost of potting soil:
   total cost = number of bags × cost of one bag

                 [/INST] To find out how many green cards there are, we know that there are 15 red cards and there are 60% more green cards than red cards. So that means:

Number of green cards = 15 * 1.6 = 24

We also know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the number of red and green cards combined. So:

Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24

Therefore,

Number of yellow cards = 39

To find the total number of cards in the set, we add up the number of red, green, and yellow cards:

Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39

The final answer is: 78 cards.</s>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially. {The number of fairies = 50.}
2. Twenty minutes later, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw join the fairies from the east. So, 50 fairies * 0.5 = 25 fairies. Therefore, the total number of fairies became 50 + 25 = 75. {The number of fairies = 75.}
3. Ten minutes after that, 30 fairies flew away. So, we need to subtract these 30 fairies from the current number of fairies. {The number of fairies = 75 - 30.}

Hence, the final answer is: {The number of fairies = 45.}</s>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw

First, let's find the number of puppies with spots from Jennifer's litter: There are 8 puppies in total, and 3 of them have spots. So, there are 3 spots- puppies in Jennifer's litter.

Next, we'll determine the number of puppies with spots from Brandon's litter: There are 12 puppies in total, and 4 of them have spots. So, there are 4 spots-puppies in Brandon's litter.

Now, we have a total of 3 spots-puppies from Jennifer's litter, and 4 spots-puppies from Brandon's litter. So the total number of spots-puppies is: 3 + 4 = 7

To find the percentage of all puppies with spots, we divide the number of spots-puppies by the total number of puppies, and multiply by 100: (7/ (12 + 8)) * 100%

Let's calculate the total number of puppies: 12 (Brandon's) + 8 (Jennifer's) = 20

So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (7/ 20) * 100% = 35% {The final answer is}.</s>","First find the total number of puppies: 8 puppies + 12 puppies = <<8+12=20>>20 puppies

                 [/INST] To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make with his farm truck to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed and then find out how many times the truck's capacity is exceeded. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Calculate the weight of each type of feed:
   - Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   - Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
   - Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   - Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box * 2 pounds/box = 4 pounds

2. Calculate the total weight of all the feed:
   Total weight = Weight of hay + Weight of oats + Weight of carrots + Weight of sugar cubes
   Total weight = 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds + 48 pounds + 4 pounds
   Total weight = 4492 pounds

3. Determine how many times the truck's capacity is exceeded:
   Number of trips exceeded = Total weight / Truck capacity
   Number of trips exceeded = 4492 pounds / 2250 pounds
   Number of trips exceeded = 2.0034 (rounded up to 3 for whole trips)

4. Find out how many extra trips are needed:
   Extra trips = Number of trips exceeded - Number of regular trips
   Extra trips = 3 - 1
   Extra trips = 2

5. Add the extra trips to the number of regular trips:
   Total trips = Regular trips + Extra trips
   Total trips = 1 + 2
   Total trips = 3

The final answer is: The farmer needs to make a total of 3 trips to transport all the feed.</s>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

                    question:
                    Miss Maria is a middle school teacher, : and she : loves to collect sports cards. She has six decks with 25 . basketball cards in each deck and five boxes with 40 baseball cards ! in each box. She keeps 50 cards and gives the remaining , cards to her students. If her students got ten cards each, how many , students does Miss Maria have?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.
Missing information: The number of decks Miss Maria has is not given, so we cannot find out the exact number of basketball cards she has. However, we know that each deck has 25 basketball cards.
{We cannot determine the number of students based on the given information.}

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.
She has five boxes, and each box has 40 baseball cards. So Miss Maria has a total of 5 boxes × 40 cards/box = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.

Step 3: Calculate how many cards Miss Maria keeps for herself.
She keeps 50 cards for herself, so we need to find out which type of cards these are (basketball or baseball). Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide this information.

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards given to the students.
Miss Maria has 200 baseball cards and keeps 50 for herself, so she gives 200 - 50 = <<200-50=150>>150 baseball cards to her students.

Step 5: Calculate the number of students who receive cards.
Each student receives 10 cards, so the number of students is 150 cards ÷ 10 cards/student = 15 students.

{The final answer is: Miss Maria has 15 students.}</s>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.
And, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.
Thus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.
She gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.
Therefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.

                 [/INST] Let's calculate the cost for each person step by step:

1. Cost for Becky:
   - Price of each apple: $0.45
   - Number of apples: 20
   - Total cost for Becky: $0.45 * 20 = $9.00

2. Cost for Kelly before discount:
   - Price of each apple: $0.50
   - Number of apples: 20
   - Total cost for Kelly before discount: $0.50 * 20 = $10.00

3. Discount for Kelly:
   - Discount amount: $1 (given in the question)
   - Discount percentage: 10%
   - Discounted price: $0.50 * (1 - 0.1) = $0.45 (rounded to the nearest cent)
   - Kelly actually paid $0.45 * 20 = $9.00 for the apples

Since both Becky and Kelly paid $9.00 for their apples, there is no difference in their costs.

Therefore, the final answer is: {No difference in the amount paid by both individuals}.</s>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

1. Each room has two sheets: So for 80 rooms, there are a total of 2 * 80 = <<2*80=160>>160 sheets.
2. Each room has one comforter: So there are 80 comforters.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets: Since there are 160 sheets in 80 rooms, each room has 160 sheets * 2 = <<160*2=320>>320 pillow cases. So in total, there are 80 * 320 = <<80*320=26240>>26,240 pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases: Since there are 320 pillow cases in 80 rooms, each room has 320 pillow cases * 2 = <<320*2=640>>640 towels. So in total, there are 80 * 640 = <<80*640=51200>>51,200 towels.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pairs of shoes Fireman Frank gets each day.
- He gets 5 pairs on Monday.
- He gets 15 pairs on Wednesday.
- He gets 30 pairs on Friday.

So, Fireman Frank gets a total of 5 + 15 + 30 = <<5+15+30=40>>40 pairs of shoes in a week.

Step 2: Find out how many pairs of shoes Fireman Frank has after getting new shoes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- He starts with 200 shoes or 200/2 = <<200/2=100>>100 pairs.
- On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, so he has 100 + 5 = <<100+5=105>>105 pairs.
- On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs, so he has 105 + 15 = <<105+15=120>>120 pairs.
- On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, so he has 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 pairs.

Step 3: Find out how many pairs of shoes Fireman Frank has left after getting rid of 180 pairs on Saturday.
- He has 150 pairs before getting rid of any shoes.
- He gets rid of 180 pairs, leaving him with 150 - 180 = <<150-180=-30>>-30 pairs, which is an inconsistent result (since it's not possible to have a negative number of pairs).

However, there is a mistake in the problem statement because Fireman Frank can't have a total of 200 shoes and gain 40 new pairs, resulting in 240 pairs (which is not possible considering he starts with 200).

So, there's no valid answer for this problem.

Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

5. The change Theo received is the difference between the total cost of the pen and the paper and the amount of money she paid the cashier.

Change = Total cost of pen and paper - Payment
Change = $8 - $10

The final answer is: Change = -$2

However, in reality, change is the amount of money that a cashier gives back to a customer after they have paid for an item or items.

   - The length of one remora is 6 inches.
   - There are 12 inches in one foot, so the length of one remora in feet is 6 inches / 12 inches/foot = 0.5 feet.
   - The total length of the two remoras is 0.5 feet * 2 = 1 foot.

4. The total length of the shark and the remoras is 10 feet + 1 foot = 11 feet.

5. To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is occupied by the combined length of the remoras, we divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark and then multiply by 100.

Let X be the number of students at that grade level.

According to the problem, three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home, which means that three-fourths of X students have one. So, the number of students with a desktop computer at home is 3/4 * X.

The problem also states that 20 students don't have a desktop computer at home. Thus, one-fourth of X students don't have one.

3/4 * X = 3/4 * X + 20
X = 20 * (4/3)

To find the value of X, we can simplify the fraction:
X = 20 * (1.33333...)
X ≈ 20 * 1.33333
X ≈ 26.66667 * 20

1. We know that it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes.
2. There are 7 days in a week (on average), so let's find out how long it takes to break in the shoes in a week.

Weekly walking minutes = Minutes to break in shoes * 7 days
Weekly walking minutes = 240 minutes * 7 days
Weekly walking minutes = 1680 minutes

Now, let's assume Jason has exactly three weeks (21 days). Let's find out how many minutes of walking he should do each day.

Daily walking minutes = Weekly walking minutes / Number of days
Daily walking minutes = 1680 minutes / 21 days
Daily walking minutes ≈ 80.5 minutes

Step 2: Let's first find out how many kids have only one allergy (either dairy or peanuts), as we cannot count these kids twice:
- There are 9 kids allergic to dairy, and 3 of them are also allergic to peanuts, hence there are 6 kids allergic to only dairy.
- Similarly, there are 6 kids allergic to peanuts, and 3 of them are also allergic to dairy, hence there are 3 kids allergic to only peanuts.
Step 3: So there are 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 kids with only one allergy.
Step 4: Now we need to find out how many kids don't have any allergy. Since there are 32 kids in total:
- The number of kids with (only) dairy allergy = 6
- The number of kids with (only) peanut allergy = 3
- The number of kids with both allergies = 3
- The number of kids with no allergies = Total kids - Kids with dairy allergy - Kids with peanut allergy - Kids with both allergies

                 [/INST] To find the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel.

First, let's find the cost of the hotel for 3 days:

Cost of hotel per day = $1500
Number of days = 3
Total cost of hotel = Cost of hotel per day * Number of days
Total cost of hotel = $1500 * 3 = $<<1500*3=4500>>4500

Next, let's find the cost of one plane ticket:

Cost of plane ticket = $5000

Since there are two people going on the trip, the total cost of the plane tickets will be:

Total cost of plane tickets = Cost of plane ticket * 2
Total cost of plane tickets = $5000 * 2 = $<<5000*2=10000>>10000

To find the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel:

Total cost of trip = Total cost of plane tickets + Total cost of hotel
Total cost of trip = $10000 + $4500 = $<<10000+4500=14500>>14,500

Therefore, the final answer is: {The total cost of the trip is $14,500}.</s>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal

                 [/INST] To find the number of tubes of paint that Jasper has, we first need to find out how many tubes of each color Ben has and then calculate how many tubes Jasper has based on that information.

1. We know that Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint.
2. Since Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, Jasper has:
   Tubes of blue paint for Jasper = Tubes of blue paint for Ben / 2
   = 4 tubes / 2
   = 2 tubes

3. We also know that Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
4. Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has:
   Tubes of yellow paint for Jasper = Tubes of yellow paint for Ben × 3
   = 3 tubes × 3
   = 9 tubes

5. To find the total number of tubes that Jasper has, we add the number of tubes of blue and yellow paint that he has:

Belen has two pennies with different weights: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny. The weight ratio of the 2010 penny to the 1959 penny is 3/4. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

Step 2: Find the weight of the 2010 penny
We know that the weight ratio of the 2010 penny to the 1959 penny is 3/4. Let X be the weight of the 2010 penny. Then X = (3/4) * (weight of 1959 penny), where the weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains.

X = (3/4) * 48
X = 3 * 12
X = 36 grains

Step 3: Find the combined weight of the two pennies
The weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains, and the weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains. To find the combined weight, simply add the weights of both pennies.

Combined weight = Weight of 1959 penny + Weight of 2010 penny

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his portable media player.
2. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 songs on his player.
3. To find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player, we need to find the difference between the maximum capacity of his player (100 songs) and the number of songs he already has (60 songs).
4. Therefore, the number of additional songs Luri can add to his player is 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 songs.
5. To find out how many fewer songs Gabriel can add to his player than Luri, we simply subtract the number of songs Gabriel can add (0) from the number of songs Luri can add (40).
6. Therefore, the number of fewer songs Gabriel can add to his player than Luri is -40 songs.
7. However, it's important to note that Gabriel cannot actually add fewer songs to his player than he currently has, so this answer doesn't really make sense in the context of the problem.

                    question:
                    An 8-year old child wants to buy a toy car which costs $12. He already has $4 savings. How many days will it take him to save the remaining amount of money if he promises to save $2 daily from ! his allowance?
                 [/INST] To find out how many days it takes the child to save the remaining amount of money, we need to find the difference between the cost of the toy car and the child's current savings, and then divide that difference by the amount of money the child saves each day from his allowance.

1. Find the difference between the cost of the toy car and the child's current savings: $12 (cost) - $4 (savings) = $8
2. Divide the difference by the amount of money the child saves each day: $8 / $2/day = 4 days

Therefore, it would take the child 4 more days to save up enough money to buy the toy car. The final answer is: it would take him a total of 4 days + his current 4 days of savings to buy the toy car. So the answer is {The final answer is 8 days}. (Note: It's stated in the question that the child already has 4 days of savings, but it's not clear when those 4 days occurred. I assumed they meant current savings as in ""savings right now."" If the savings of 4 days refers to savings earned before this toy car purchase consideration, then the child would need to save an additional 4 days, making the total 8 days.)</s>","The boy still needs $12 - $4 = $<<12-4=8>>8.
If he saves $2 per day then it will take him $8 / $2/day = <<8/2=4>>4 days to save the remaining amount.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Check if the number of eggs Jaime has is a multiple of the number of eggs that can be placed on one tray.

64 eggs is not a multiple of 24 eggs that can be placed on one tray.

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs that can be placed on 2 trays.

Number of eggs on 2 trays = Number of eggs per tray * Number of trays
Number of eggs on 2 trays = 24 eggs/tray * 2 trays
Number of eggs on 2 trays = 48 eggs

Step 3: Determine how many eggs Jaime is able to place on the trays.

Number of eggs on trays = Number of eggs on 2 trays
Number of eggs on trays = 48 eggs

Step 4: Subtract the number of eggs Jaime can place on the trays from the total number of eggs he has.

Number of eggs left = Total number of eggs - Number of eggs on trays
Number of eggs left = 64 eggs - 48 eggs
Number of eggs left = 16 eggs

Step 5: The final answer

If Jaime has 64 eggs and 2 trays, he will not be able to place 16 eggs on the trays. {The final answer is: He will not be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.}</s>","Jaime will be able to place a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of the family-size pizza.
Since the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza, which costs $8, we have:

Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 * $8
Cost of family-size pizza = $24

Step 2: Find the total amount Sally spends.
Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total amount spent = $8 + $24
Total amount spent = $32

{The final answer is: Sally spends a total of $32 on both pizzas.}</s>","The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 x $8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying 2 packs of razors without any discounts or coupons.
Cost of 1 pack = $4.00
Cost of 2 packs = 2 * $4.00 = $8.00

Step 2: Apply the ""buy one get one free"" discount. With this discount, Heather essentially gets one razor pack for free when she buys another pack. So, the cost of buying 2 packs with the discount is $4.00 less than the cost of buying 3 packs without the discount.
Cost of 3 packs = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00
Cost of 2 packs with discount = $12.00 - $4.00 = $8.00

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon. This reduces the cost of the 2 packs by $2.00.
Cost of 2 packs after coupon = $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of one individual razor after buying 2 packs. Each pack contains 4 razors, so the cost of 2 razors is half the cost of 2 packs.
Cost of 2 razors = $6.00 / 2 = $3.00

So, the cost of each individual razor after the discount and using the coupon is $3.00, or 300 cents. {The final answer is 300 cents}.</s>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors

                 [/INST] To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to determine the height of each layer of girls.

1. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall. The total height of the 9 standard cheerleaders is:
   Height of 9 girls = Number of girls * Height of one girl
   Height of 9 girls = 9 * 64 inches
   Height of 9 girls = 576 inches

2. Since there are 11 girls in total, the height of the remaining cheerleader who is 60 inches tall represents the height of 2 girls (her own height plus the height of her partner on the bottom). Therefore, the height of one girl is:
   Height of one girl = 60 inches / 2
   Height of one girl = 30 inches

3. The first layer has 4 girls, so the height of this layer is:
   Height of the first layer = Number of girls * Height of one girl
   Height of the first layer = 4 * 30 inches
   Height of the first layer = 120 inches

4. The second layer has 3 girls, so the height of this layer is:
   Height of the second layer = Number of girls * Height of one girl
   Height of the second layer = 3 * 30 inches
   Height of the second layer = 90 inches

5. The third layer has 2 girls, so the height of this layer is:
   Height of the third layer = Number of girls * Height of one girl
   Height of the third layer = 2 * 30 inches
   Height of the third layer = 60 inches

6. The final layer, where the shortest girl is, has a height equal to her height:
   Height of the final layer = Height of the shortest girl
   Height of the final layer = 60 inches

7. To determine the total height of the human pyramid, we add the heights of each layer:
   Total height of the human pyramid = Height of the first layer + Height of the second layer + Height of the third layer + Height of the final layer
   Total height of the human pyramid = 120 inches + 90 inches + 60 inches + 60 inches

{The final answer is 330 inches or approximately 27.5 feet}.</s>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

                 [/INST] To find the number of minutes Charisma has walked in 5 days, we need to first determine how many walks she takes in a day and then multiply that number by the duration of each walk and the number of days.

1. Charisma takes a 5-minute walk every hour she's at work. She works for 8 hours a day. So, there are 8 hours / 1 hour = 8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes/day.
2. She takes a 5-minute walk every hour, so she takes 480 minutes/day ÷ 5 minutes/walk = 96 walks/day.
3. In 5 days, she takes 96 walks/day × 5 days = 480 walks.
4. Each walk lasts 5 minutes, so in total, she has walked 480 walks × 5 minutes/walk = 2400 minutes.

Step 1: We know that Brett is currently 14 years old.
Step 2: In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

First, let's find out how old Brett will be in four years:
Brett's age in 4 years = Current age + Number of years
Brett's age in 4 years = 14 + 4
Brett's age in 4 years = 18

Now we know that Angela will be three times as old as Brett is in 4 years. So let's find out Angela's age:
Angela's age = Three times Brett's age in 4 years
Angela's age = 3 * (Brett's age in 4 years)
Angela's age = 3 * 18
Angela's age = 54

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each morning ride.
The cost of each morning ride is $6.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of each afternoon ride.
The cost of each afternoon ride is $2.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of each day's rides.
The total cost of one day's rides is the cost of morning ride + the cost of afternoon ride, which is $6 (morning) + $2 (afternoon) = $8.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of his driving for 14 days.

Step 2: Determine the total number of oranges available for making Greek orange pies.
- The problem states that one Greek orange pie requires three oranges.
- To find out how many pies they can make with all the available oranges, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges required per pie.

Total number of pies = Total number of oranges / Oranges per pie
Total number of pies = (50 + 70) / 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pies they can make.
Total number of pies = (50 + 70) / 3

                    question:
                    Mark is trying to choose between two ; venues for a surprise party , for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests ! attend.  While the second charges, $25 ! per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, ; which Mark estimates . will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are ; necessary for the two venues : to be equal in cost?
                 [/INST] To find the number of guests required for both venues to have equal cost, we need to find the break-even point where the total cost for both venue fees and food are equal.

Let's denote the number of guests for the first venue as x, and the number of guests for the second venue as y.

The total cost for the first venue (venue 1) is given by:

Total cost for venue 1 = Flat fee + Total food cost
Total cost for venue 1 = $200 + $5x (where x is the number of guests)

The total cost for the second venue (venue 2) is given by:

Total cost for venue 2 = Cost per person + Food cost per person (already included)
Total cost for venue 2 = $25 + $5y (where y is the number of guests)

Since we want to find the number of guests for both venues to have equal cost, we can set up the equation:

$200 + $5x = $25 + $5y

To simplify the equation, subtract $200 from both sides, and then subtract $5y from both sides:

$5x = $5y - $5y + $200

Or,

$5x = $200

Now we can divide both sides by 5 to find the number of guests required for venue 1:

x = 40

So, the first venue would cost $600 in total for 40 guests.

Let's find the number of guests for the second venue when the total cost is equal to $600:

Total cost for venue 2 = $25 + $5y
$600 = $25 + $5y

Subtract $25 from both sides:

$595 = $5y

Divide both sides by 5:

y = 119

Therefore, the second venue would need 119 guests to make the total cost equal to $600.

Since we originally found that the first venue needed 40 guests, these numbers are not the same, meaning that the cost will always be different for the given conditions.

However, if Mark wants to find the number of guests at which both venues have equal cost per person, we can set up the equation:

($200/x) = ($25/y)

This equation sets up a ratio between the cost per guest for each venue. We can't solve it directly for the number of guests, but we can calculate the approximate result:

$200/x = $25/y

$200 = 5*$25/y
$200 = $125y/x

x = $200 * y / $125

x ≈ 1.6 * y

So, based on the given conditions, the second venue would need approximately 1.6 times the number of guests as the first venue to have equal cost per person.

Note that since x must be a whole number for the number of guests, this condition is not met with the given values, meaning that there is no exact answer to this question according to the problem's conditions.</s>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

First, solve for x in the given equation:

x + x/2 = 43
2x/2 = 43
x = 43 * 2 / 2
x = 43

Therefore, Bodhi found 43 insects. We're told that Lily found 7 more than David, so she found x + 7 = 43 + 7 = 50 insects.

1. Suzie bought a total of 4 packs of gum with a total cost of $7.
2. She bought 2 packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry.
3. Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.
4. The cost of the 2 packs of strawberry gum is $2 x 2 = $4.

Now we need to find out how much she spent on the other 2 packs that were not strawberry.

5. One pack of gum was grape, which cost $2.
6. The other pack was green apple, which cost half as much as the grape gum so it cost $2 / 2 = $1.

So Suzie spent $4 on strawberry gum and $3 on the other gums (grape and green apple). We can find the cost of one pack of strawberry gum by dividing the total cost of strawberry gum ($4) by the number of packs she bought ($2).

7. The cost of one pack of strawberry gum is $4 / 2 = $2.

{The final answer is: Each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.}</s>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest lumber?
                 [/INST] To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with $24, we need to determine how many sticks he can get from each type of wood and which one is the most cost-effective.

1. First, let's calculate how many sticks Frederick can get from a 2 x 4 (costs $4) and a 2 x 8 (costs $6).

From 1 2 x 4, he can get 200 sticks (as stated in the question).
From 1 2 x 8, he can get 400 sticks.

2. To find out which type of wood is more cost-effective, we divide the number of sticks produced by the cost:

Cost-effectiveness of 2 x 4: Sticks per dollar = 200 / $4 = 50 sticks/dollar
Cost-effectiveness of 2 x 8: Sticks per dollar = 400 / $6 = 66.67 sticks/dollar

Since Frederick can only buy full quantities of wood, the 2 x 8 is more cost-effective as it gives him 66.67 sticks per dollar but in reality, he gets 400 sticks for $6.

3. To find out how many sticks Frederick can get with $24 by buying the cheapest (2 x 8), we multiply the cost-effectiveness by the available budget:

Maximum sticks Frederick can make = cost-effectiveness * budget
                                       = 66.67 sticks/dollar * $24

4. However, since Frederick can't buy a fraction of a 2 x 8, we must round down to the nearest whole number of 2 x 8s he can buy:

$24 / $6 = 4 whole 2 x 8s

5. Once we know Frederick can get 4 2 x 8s, we can calculate how many sticks he can produce:

Total sticks = Total sticks per 2 x 8 * Number of 2 x 8s
            = 400 sticks per 2 x 8 * 4
            = 1600 sticks

However, the initial question included a mistake as the number of popsicle sticks Frederick could get from the 2 x 4 was stated incorrectly (at most 200 sticks were supposed to be obtained per 2 x 4). Since the information given at the beginning of the question was inaccurate, the final calculation for the maximum number of popsicle sticks that could be produced is inconsistent.

With the correct information, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600, given that he buys the cheapest (2 x 8) wood. {The final answer is 1600 popsicle sticks.}</s>","He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6
He can make 1200 sticks with this wood because 6 x 200 = <<6*200=1200>>1200
He can buy four 2 x 8's because 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4
He can make 1600 sticks from this because 4 x 400 = <<4*400=1600>>1600
He can make 1600 sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber because 1600 > 1200

1. Since each dog has 4 legs, and each pair of snowshoes is for a leg, we need one pair of snowshoes per dog. So, the number of pairs required is equal to the number of dogs.

2. There are 6 dogs.

3. Therefore, Mario needs to buy 6 pairs of snowshoes.

4. The cost of one pair of snowshoes is $12.00.

5. To calculate the total cost, we'll multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. Janet takes two bus trips every day, so the number of bus trips she takes in a week is: 2 (trips per day) × 5 (days per week) = 10 trips per week.
2. Each bus trip costs Janet $2.20. So, the total cost of her bus trips in a week is: 10 (trips per week) × $2.20 (cost per trip) = $22 per week.
3. Janet can buy a weekly bus pass for $20 instead of paying for each individual trip. The difference in cost between paying for each trip and buying a weekly pass is: $22 (cost of individual trips) − $20 (cost of weekly pass) = $2.

So, by buying a weekly bus pass, Janet saves $2 every week. {The final answer is $2}.</s>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

2. We're told that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has 30 x 2 = 60 cows.
3. We're also told that the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has 60 / 2 = 30 sheep.
4. The zoo has twice as many sheep as the farm, so the zoo has 30 x 2 = 60 sheep.

Now let's find the total number of animals in both the farm and the zoo:
5. The farm has 30 cows and 30 sheep, so it has 30 + 30 = 60 animals.

                 [/INST] To find out how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we first need to find out how many onions and potatoes she bought relative to Rose's purchase.

1. We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
2. We also know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
3. Let's denote the number of onions that Sophia bought as x. Then the number of onions that Rose bought is 12 (x).
4. Since Rose bought 4 times as many onions as Sophia, we have x = (1/4)(12) = 3x.
5. Solving for x, we find that x = 3 onions for each onion that Rose bought.
6. Similarly, since Rose bought 4 times as many potatoes as Sophia, Sophia bought x/4 = 0.75x potatoes for every potato that Rose bought.
7. However, we know that Rose bought 4 potatoes, so Sophia bought 4 * 0.75x = 3x/2 potatoes.
8. In sum, Sophia bought 3x onions and 3x/2 potatoes.

{The final answer is 3x onions and 3x/2 potatoes for Sophia.}

To find the exact number, we would need to know the value of x, which depends on the original number of onions or potatoes that Sophia bought compared to Rose.</s>","The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.

To find the number of days between these two dates, we'll use the number of days in each month and the day difference.

- Days from December 31st to January 31st: 31 days
- Days from January 1st to July 19th: 183 days

Total days: 31 + 183 = 214 days

Step 2: Calculate the required calorie deficit for losing 30 lbs.
Andy needs to lose 30 lbs, and it takes a calorie deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound. So, for 30 lbs, he needs a calorie deficit of:
30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days to find the daily calorie deficit.
To find the daily calorie deficit, divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:
105,000 calories / 214 days = 494 calories/day (approximately)

So, {Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of approximately 494 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th.}</s>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July.

Step 2: She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km.

Step 3: First, let's find out how far Hannah runs in total (distance) by multiplying the number of laps by the length of each lap:
Distance = Number of laps × Length of each lap
Distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap

Step 4: Since 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, we need to convert the length of each lap from meters to kilometers before calculating the amount of water Hannah needs to drink:
0.25 km = 0.25 × 1000 m/km = 250 m

Step 5: Now, let's calculate the total distance Hannah runs in kilometers:
Total distance = Distance in meters ÷ 1000 m/km
Total distance = 250 m ÷ 1000 m/km = 0.25 km
Total distance = 0.25 km × 8 laps = 2 km

                    question:
                    ? A house and : a lot cost $120,000. ; If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the cost of the lot as L. We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so:

L + HouseCost = 120000

Step 2: The problem states that the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can represent the cost of the house as 3L.

3L + L = 120000

Step 3: Since L is the cost of the lot, we know that L < 120000 (otherwise the house would cost less than the lot, which doesn't make sense). Let's try different values of L to find one that satisfies the equation:

If L = 20000, then 3L + L = 20000 x 4 = 80000 + 20000 = 100000, which is not the given total cost.

If L = 40000, then 3L + L = 40000 x 4 = 160000 + 40000 = 200000, which is also not the given total cost.

If L = 60000, then 3L + L = 60000 x 4 = 240000 + 60000 = 300000, which is still not the given total cost.

If L = 80000, then 3L + L = 80000 x 4 = 320000 + 80000 = 400000, which is more than the given total cost.

We can see from this process of elimination that no value of L satisfies the equation with the given total cost. This means that the information given in the problem is inconsistent, and there is no valid solution.

Therefore, there is no answer to this problem. {No valid solution} or {The given information is inconsistent} could be considered as the final answer.</s>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

                 [/INST] To calculate Tara's profit, we first need to determine the cost she incurred to buy and paint the bags, and then subtract the cost from the selling price. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Cost of buying 8 packs of 5 canvas bags:
   - Cost per pack: $4
   - Total number of bags: 8 packs × 5 bags/pack = 40 bags
   - Cost to buy all the bags: 40 bags × $4/bag = $160

2. Cost of painting the bags: The question doesn't provide enough information to determine the cost of painting each bag. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact profit Tara made from selling the painted bags.

However, we can still calculate the profit she made on the sale of each painted bag.

3. Selling price of each painted bag: $8

To calculate the profit made on the sale of one bag, subtract the cost of buying the bag and painting it from the selling price:

Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost of buying a bag (before painting) - Cost of painting

However, since we don't know the cost of painting each bag, we cannot calculate the exact profit Tara earned per bag.

The final answer is: The profit Tara earned on each bag is not provided in the question, and therefore cannot be determined.</s>","The total number of bags is 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40

                 [/INST] To find out how many punches Joe threw in total during the fight, we need to calculate the number of punches he threw in each round and then add up the numbers for all five rounds.

First, let's determine how many punches Joe throws in one round. We know he throws 0.25 punches per second, and each round lasts 3 minutes (or 180 seconds). So,

Number of punches in one round = Punches per second * Number of seconds in a round
= 0.25 * 180
= 45

Now, we can calculate the total number of punches Joe threw during the whole fight by finding the product of the number of punches thrown in one round and the number of rounds.

Total number of punches = Punches per round * Number of rounds
= 45 * 5
= 225

Therefore, the final answer is: {Joe threw 225 punches during the fight}.</s>","The fight lasted 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 minutes

x / 4 = 36

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation for x:

x = 4 * 36
x = 144

So Josh made 144 cookies. According to the problem, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:

Kelsie's cookies = 2 * Josh's cookies = 2 * 144 = 288

                 [/INST] First, we need to find the total amount of money Ali has before giving any to his sister. We have four $10 bills, so that's $40. Six $20 bills give us $120.

Total money before giving to sister = $40 (from $10 bills) + $120 (from $20 bills)
Total money before giving to sister = $160

Next, we need to find out how much money Ali gives to his sister. That's half of the total amount of money he has:

Money given to sister = Total money before giving to sister / 2
Money given to sister = $160 / 2
Money given to sister = $80

So after giving the money to his sister, Ali has:

Money left after giving to sister = Total money before giving to sister - Money given to sister
Money left after giving to sister = $160 - $80
Money left after giving to sister = $80

Finally, we need to find out how much money Ali spends on dinner. He uses 3/5 of the remaining money:

Money for dinner = Money left after giving to sister * 3/5
Money for dinner = $80 * 3/5
Money for dinner = $120 * 3/($2*5)
Money for dinner = $120 * 3 / 10
Money for dinner = $36

So after buying the dinner, Ali has:

Final amount of money = Money left after giving to sister - Money for dinner
Final amount of money = $80 - $36
Final amount of money = $44

Therefore, {The final answer is $44}.</s>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80
He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how long it takes Rob to shingle a house. We are given that Rob takes 2 hours.

Step 2: We are told that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob to shingle a house. Let's represent the time it takes Rob to shingle a house as ""x"" (in hours).

Step 3: Since Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes, we have Royce's time (in hours) as 2x + 0.67 (since 40 minutes is equal to 0.67 hours).

Step 4: To find the time it takes Royce in minutes, we can convert both Rob and Royce's times to minutes and then subtract their differences.

First, we'll find the time it takes Rob in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

Next, we'll find the time it takes Royce in hours: (2x + 0.67) hours, and then convert it to minutes: (2x + 0.67) hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120x + 40.2Minutes

Since we want the answer in minutes with two decimal places, we can approximate the decimal minutes as another whole minute. So, the difference in minutes between Royce and Rob is 120x + 40.2 ≈ 120x + 41 minutes.

Step 5: The final answer is: The time it takes Royce, in minutes, to shingle a house is approximately 120x + 41 minutes. We cannot provide a specific numerical answer without knowing the value of the variable ""x,"" which represents how long it takes Rob to shingle a house.</s>","Convert 2 hours to min: 2(60)=120 minutes

1. Hat: 2 skeins
2. Scarf: 4 skeins
3. Sweater: 12 skeins
4. Mittens: 1 skein
5. Socks: 2 skeins

Total skeins for one grandchild = 2 (for the hat) + 4 (for the scarf) + 12 (for the sweater) + 1 (for the mittens) + 2 (for the socks) = 19 skeins

Now, we need to find out how many skeins of wool Martha will need to buy for all three grandchildren. We multiply the number of skeins required for one grandchild by the number of grandchildren, i.e.,

Total skeins for all three grandchildren = 19 skeins/grandchild × 3 grandchildren = 57 skeins

Therefore, {Martha will need to buy 57 skeins of wool to make one set of winter wear for all three grandchildren}.</s>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.

Red tulips: Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in one row. So, the number of rows he can plant with 36 red tulips is:
Number_of_rows_red = Total_red_tulips / Number_of_red_tulips_per_row = 36 / 6 = 6

Number_of_rows_blue = Total_blue_tulips / Number_of_blue_tulips_per_row = 24 / 8 = 3

As Jackson is planting rows separate for red and blue tulips, he will have 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips in total.

{The final answer is: Jackson will plant 6 rows of red tulips and 3 rows of blue tulips.}

So, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is rows_red + rows_blue = 6 + 3 = 9.

A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?
                 [/INST] To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine the total number of cups of raisins that will be used for making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Let's assume Heather uses a certain percentage p for oatmeal cookies, q for granola, and r for snack mix.

Since 1 batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins:
Cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies = (Percentage for oatmeal cookies) * (Total cups of raisins)

We know that Heather has 27 cups of raisins. So, the total cups of raisins that will be used for all three types of recipes should be less than or equal to 27.

Let x be the total number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make. Then, the number of cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies will be 3/4x.

Similarly, the cups of raisins for granola and snack mix will be (percentage for granola) * (total cups of raisins) and (percentage for snack mix) * (total cups of raisins), respectively.

Now we have the following equation:
3/4x + p * (Total cups of raisins) + q * (Total cups of raisins) + r * (Total cups of raisins) ≤ 27

Since we don't know the exact percentage of raisins used for granola and snack mix, we cannot directly calculate the number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make. However, we can check the maximum number of batches of oatmeal cookies that would be possible if the raisins were only used for that purpose.

To find the maximum number of batches of oatmeal cookies, we can set the quantity of raisins used for oatmeal cookies as 100% of the total cups:
x * (3/4) ≤ 27

Solving this inequality, we get:
x ≤ (27 * 4/3)

x ≤ 21.11

Since we cannot make a fraction of a batch, the maximum number of batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make while equally dividing the raisins among all three recipes is 21.

If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before . and after she adds the new device?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption and the electric consumption of the new device:
Ada's daily consumption = 12 kW
New device's daily consumption = 2 kW

Step 2: Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device:
Days in a week = 7
Weekly consumption before = Daily consumption * Days per week
Weekly consumption before = 12 kW * 7 = 84 kWh
Weekly bill before = Weekly consumption before * Cost per kWh
Weekly bill before = 84 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $126

Step 3: Calculate Ada's weekly electric consumption after adding the new device:
Weekly consumption after = (Daily consumption + New device consumption) * Days per week
Weekly consumption after = (12 kW + 2 kW) * 7 = 100.8 kWh
Weekly bill after = Weekly consumption after * Cost per kWh
Weekly bill after = 100.8 kWh * $1.50/kWh = $151.2

Step 4: Find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device:
Difference = Weekly bill after - Weekly bill before
Difference = $151.2 - $126 = $25.2

{The final answer is: $25.2}</s>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                 [/INST] First, we need to find out how many hours it takes for one person to paint half a house. We're given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, but we need to find out how many hours that is. We know there are 24 hours in a day.

 step 1: Calculate the number of hours it takes for one person to paint half a house:
 Half a house in 5 days = Half a house in (5 days * 24 hours/day) = Half a house in 120 hours

Now that we know it takes one person 120 hours to paint half a house, we can calculate how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

 step 2: Calculate the number of hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house:
 Assuming all 5 people work at the same time and maintain the same painting pace, it would take them half the time it takes one person because there are 5 of them, working concurrently, instead of just one.

 step 3: Calculate the total hours required for 5 people to paint a whole house:
 Time for 5 people to paint a whole house = Half the time for one person to paint half a house
 Time for 5 people to paint a whole house = 120 hours / 2 = 60 hours

Step 3: We're also told that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. Let's denote the number of chairs Ophelia has as x. Then, the number of chairs Jenna has is 3x.

Step 4: We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer chairs than sofas she has. So, if Ophelia has 20 sofas, she has x chairs. Hence, x = 20 - 2 = 18.

Step 5: Therefore, Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 18 * 3 = 54 chairs. {The final answer is Ophelia has 20 sofas and 18 chairs, and Jenna has 18 sofas and 54 chairs}.</s>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

=> Hours for 7 weeks = 7 * 4
=> Hours for 7 weeks = 28 hours

Step 2: Calculate the hours for the week where Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. This is one instance of deviating from the normal routine.

=> Hours for this week = 5 hours (for each of the two weeks) => 10 hours total

Step 3: Calculate the hours for the week where Josh spent 6 hours. This is another instance of deviating from the normal routine.

=> Hours for this week = 6 hours

Step 4: Sum up the hours for each of the given 8 weeks to get the total hours Josh has spent working out.

=> Total hours = Hours for normal weeks + Hours for deviating weeks

                 [/INST] Let's denote Jame's current age as X. We know that in 5 years, Jame will turn 27, so:

X + 5 = 27
X = 22

Now we know that in 8 years, Jame's cousin's age will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. So, let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as Y, and in 8 years, his age will be X+8. The equation for his age in 8 years is:

Y + 8 = 2*(X+8) - 5

Substituting X with the value we found earlier, we get:

Y + 8 = 2*(22+8) - 5
Y + 8 = 2*(30) - 5
Y + 8 = 58 - 5

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

Y + 8 = 53
Y = 45

So, Jame is currently 22 years old, and his cousin is 45 years old. The age difference between them is:

| Jame's age - Cousin's age | = | 22 - 45 |

                 [/INST] To find the cost of one monitor, we need to find the cost of the other monitor first, since we only know the cost of one monitor and the total cost of two monitors.

Let's call the cost of one monitor ""x"". Since Errol bought two monitors, the total cost of the monitors is 2x.

The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. So, we can write an equation:

$1,100 \ (computer) + 2x \ (monitors) + y \ (printer) = $2,400

We know that the printer cost $400 less than the computer. So, y = $700.

Now we have:

$1,100 + 2x + $700 = $2,400

We can simplify this equation:

$1,800 + 2x = $2,400

Now, we can subtract $1,800 from both sides of the equation:

$600 + 2x = $600

Subtracting $600 from both sides:

2x = 0

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 0

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are 20 kids in total, and they were divided into two equal groups for the scavenger hunt. Therefore, there are 10 kids in each group (girls and boys).

Step 2: The boys brought back 60 shells each. So, the number of seashells brought by the boys in total is 60 shells per boy * 10 boys = 600 shells.

Step 3: The girls brought seashells equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many. Mathematically, we can represent it as: Shells brought by girls = Shells brought by boys + 4 * Shells brought by boys

Step 4: To find the number of seashells brought by each girl, we simply divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls.

Total seashells brought by girls = (Shells brought by boys + 4 * Shells brought by boys) * Number of girls

Step 5: Substituting the values from the earlier steps, we get:
Total seashells brought by girls = (600 + 4 * 600) * 10

Total seashells brought by girls = 126,000

Step 7: Now, to find the number of seashells each girl brought, we divide the total seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls.

Seashells brought by one girl = Total seashells brought by girls / Number of girls
Seashells brought by one girl = 126,000 / 10

We know that George initially had more candies than he does now, and that he ate 5 candies. Therefore, the difference in the number of candies between George and Nick before George ate the candies is equal to the number of candies George had left after eating 5 candies:

G - 3 = 2(G)

Subtracting G from both sides, we get:

G = 2G - 3

Subtracting G from both sides again:

G = G - 3

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

G = -3

This result is not valid, as we cannot have a negative number of candies. This means that our initial assumption that Nick had twice as many candies as George was incorrect. Let's try to find another explanation for the given information.

One possible solution could be that Nick initially had the same number of candies as George, and George ate 5 candies. In that case, Nick still has twice as many candies as George:

G = G - 5
N = G * 2

Substituting G with 3 (since we know that George has 3 candies left):

G = 3 - 5 = -2
N = G * 2 = 2 * (-2) = -4

Again, this result is not valid, as we cannot have a negative number of candies for Nick.

                 [/INST] To find out how many vlogs Emma needs to make in total to reach 72 vlogs per month, let's first calculate the number of vlogs she made in the first three weeks and then find the difference between her target and her current production.

1. Calculate the number of vlogs Emma made in the first three weeks:
   vlogs in the first week = 18
   vlogs in the second week = 21
   vlogs in the third week = 15
   Total vlogs in the first three weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54

2. Calculate the number of vlogs she needs to make in a month to reach her target of 72 vlogs:
   Number of vlogs per month = 72

3. Subtract the number of vlogs Emma has already made from her monthly target to find the number of vlogs she needs to make in the remaining weeks:
   Target - Already made = Vlogs to be made
   Total vlogs to be made = 72 - 54 = 18

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the dinner for one person.
The total bill is $50. Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, the cost of the dinner for one person is $50 divided by 2, which is $25.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of the tip.
Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. So, the tip amount is 0.20 (or 20%) multiplied by the cost of the dinner, which is $25. Tip = $25 * 0.20 = $5.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount you pay.
The total amount you pay is the cost of the dinner for one person plus the tip. Total amount = $25 + $5 = $30.

{The final answer is: You paid $30 for the dinner.}</s>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person

3. The next day, the eldest adds another $10 to his share, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.
4. He spends $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Elvis needs to save daily in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target, we first need to find out how much he needs to save daily in the first half.

1. We know that Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
2. To find out how much he needs to save daily in the first half of the month, we divide the monthly saving target by the number of days in the first half:

First half days = 15 (assuming there are 15 days in the first half of the month)
Daily saving in first half = Monthly saving target / First half days
Daily saving in first half = $1125 / 15
Daily saving in first half = $75.33 (approximately)

Now that we know Elvis saves approximately $75.33 daily in the first half of the month, we can find out how much he needs to save daily in the second half to save twice as much as that amount.

3. We know that Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half to reach his target.
4. Therefore, the daily saving in the second half will be:

Daily saving in second half = 2 * Daily saving in first half
Daily saving in second half = 2 * $75.33
Daily saving in second half = $150.67 (approximately)

So, Elvis needs to save approximately $150.67 daily in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target.

{The final answer is: Elvis needs to save approximately $150.67 daily in the second half of the month to reach his monthly saving target.}</s>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125

                 [/INST] To find out how much change Verna received, we first need to find out how much she spent on the fruits.

1. Cost of apples: She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each, so the cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
2. Cost of oranges: She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so the cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
3. Cost of peaches: She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so the cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50
4. Total cost of fruits: $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

5. Now we know that Verna gave $20. So, the amount of change she received is $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Step 1: Calculate the earnings of Jairus for finishing 20 tasks.
Earnings of Jairus = Number of tasks * Payment per task
Earnings of Jairus = 20 * $0.8
Earnings of Jairus = $16

Step 2: Calculate the earnings of Jenny for finishing 20 tasks.
Earnings of Jenny = Number of tasks * Payment per task
Earnings of Jenny = 20 * $0.5
Earnings of Jenny = $10

Step 3: Find the difference in their earnings.

x (Brad's share) + 4x (Jeff's share) = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5 to find the value of x:

x = 20

Now that we know the amount Brad gets is $20, we can find the amount Jeff gets:

Jeff's share = 4 * Brad's share
              = 4 * $20

3. Elise re-writes everything she has written already. The letters she had written before re-writing are 2 exclamation marks and 1 period, which is a total of 3 letters.
   So, during re-writing, Elise writes these letters again: 3 letters
4. Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is the number of letters during the first round of writing plus the number of letters during the re-writing process: 2 exclamation marks + 1 period + 3 replacements = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 letters

1. Mark lost 10 pounds each month for three months. Therefore, his total weight loss was:
   Total weight loss = Pounds lost per month * Number of months
   Total weight loss = 10 pounds * 3 months
   Total weight loss = 30 pounds

2. Mark's final weight is given as 70 pounds. So we need to subtract his total weight loss from his final weight to find his initial weight:

4. Cost of one geometry set:
Cost of one geometry set = $10
Total cost of geometry set = Cost of one geometry set = $10

5. Calculate the total cost of all items:
Total cost of items before discount = Total cost of notebooks + Total cost of pens + Total cost of calculator + Total cost of geometry set
Total cost of items before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20.50

6. Apply the 10% discount:
Discount amount = Total cost of items before discount * 0.10
Discount amount = $20.50 * 0.10 = $2.05

7. Final calculate the amount Daniel needs to pay:

5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the potato fries.
10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3.00
Total cost of potato fries = $3.00 * 10 = $30

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fruit drinks.
5 cans * $2 each can = $10

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the order.
Total cost = cost of hamburgers + cost of potato fries + cost of fruit drinks
Total cost = $20 + $30 + $10 = $60

Step 5: Calculate how much change Carly will get back from giving a $50 bill.
Change = $50 - Total cost
Change = $50 - $60 = -$10

However, it's important to note that Carly cannot get a negative change.

Additional Commission = $1500 * 0.1
Additional Commission = $150

Step 3: Calculate the total commission earned by Antonella.
Total Commission = Commission + Additional Commission
Total Commission = $300 + $150

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a cold day.
Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day.

Step 2: Find the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day.
On a warm day, it takes Ray 2 minutes more than twice as long to swim a mile as it does on a cold day. So, the time it takes Ray to swim a mile on a warm day is 2 minutes more than 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.

Step 3: Find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day.
Since Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, it would take him 3 miles / 1 mile = 3 times longer to swim 3 miles on a cold day. So, the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day is 16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes.

Step 4: Find the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day.
On a hot day, it takes Ray more than twice as long to swim a mile, so it will take him more than twice as long to swim 3 miles as well. Since it takes him 32 minutes to swim a mile on a warm day, it would take him 3 miles / 1 mile * 32 minutes/mile = 96 minutes (or 1 hour and 36 minutes) to swim 3 miles on a hot day.

Step 5: Find the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.
The difference in time is the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day minus the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day, which is 96 minutes - 48 minutes = 48 minutes.

{The final answer is: Ray takes an additional 48 minutes to swim 3 miles on a hot day as compared to a cold day.}</s>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the amount of money John earns per week.
John works 5 hours a day, so he earns $2 per hour, so he earns $10 per day (5 hours * $2/hour). John works 4 days a week, so he earns $40 per week (4 days * $10/day).

Step 2: Determine how many weeks it takes John to save $80.
John needs to save an additional $80, so the total amount he needs to save each week is $80 + $40 = $120 per week. To find out how many weeks it takes him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by the amount he saves per week: $80 / $40/week = 2 weeks. However, we have already calculated that he saves $40 per week, so it actually takes him 2 weeks to save the extra $80 on top of his regular savings. Therefore, the total number of weeks it takes him to save $80 is 2 weeks (for the extra $80) + 1 week (for his regular $40 savings) = 3 weeks.

1. We know that a foot-long fish sub costs $40.
2. We're also told that a six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much.
3. First, let's find out how much a six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs. Since it costs thrice as much as a foot-long fish sub, which is $40, then the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs $40 * 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
4. Now, we know that you bought one foot-long fish sub and three six-inch cold-cut combo subs. So, the total cost of your lunch is $40 for the fish sub + $120 for the three cold-cut combo subs = $<<40+120=160>>160.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of buttons with two holes ""x"" and the number of buttons with four holes ""y"". We know that the total number of buttons is 21, so we can write an equation:

x + y = 21

We also know that 7 buttons had two holes, so x = 7. Now we can find the number of buttons with four holes:

y = 21 - x = 21 - 7 = 14

So, there are 7 buttons with 2 holes and 14 buttons with 4 holes in the bag. The total number of holes in all the buttons can be found by multiplying the number of each type of button by the corresponding number of holes:

Holes in the bag = 2 * (Number of buttons with 2 holes) + 4 * (Number of buttons with 4 holes)
= 2 * 7 + 4 * 14 = 14

{The final answer is 14 holes in total}</s>","There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.
The four-holed buttons had 14 * 4 = <<14*4=56>>56 holes.

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's first find out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily. We know she drinks half the daily recommended amount. The daily recommended amount for an adult is typically around 3-4 cups, so:

Octavia's cups = Daily recommended amount / 2
= 3-4 cups / 2
= 1.5-2 cups

Since it's not possible to drink half a cup, we'll assume Octavia drinks 2 cups of coffee daily.

Step 2: Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so:

Juan's cups = Octavia's cups × 10
= 2 × 10
= 10 cups

Step 3: Juan has been asked to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. So, to find out by how many cups Juan should reduce his daily coffee intake, subtract the new recommended intake from his current intake:

Cups to reduce = Juan's cups - New recommended amount
= 10 cups - 4 cups
= 6 cups

{The final answer is: Juan should reduce his daily coffee intake by 6 cups.}</s>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups

Step 1: Find the angle the sun moves per hour.
Given that the sun moves at an angle of 5 degrees per hour relative to Sahir's house and the pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, we can find the angle the sun makes with the ground when it has moved for 10 hours by multiplying the hourly angle by the number of hours.

Angle of sun after 10 hours = Angle moved per hour * Number of hours
Angle of sun after 10 hours = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the angle of the sun from the ground after 10 hours.

Angle of sun after 10 hours = 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours
Angle of sun after 10 hours = 50 degrees

Step 3: Add this angle to the angle of the pyramids to find the angle from the ground to the sun.

Angle from ground to sun = Angle of pyramids + Angle of sun

Step 1: Find the number of candles for each son
The younger son is 4 years younger than the older son, so the older son is 12 + 4 = 16 years old.

We don't know the exact number of candles each son wants on their birthday cake, but we do know that a pack of 5 candles costs $3. Let's assume each son will want a number of candles that can be bought with the number of candles in a single pack multiplied by some integer.

For the older son (16 years old): number of candles = x * 5

                    In the first week, : Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In , the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?
                 [/INST] To find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to first find out how many pages she read in the second week, and then add that to the number of pages she read in the first week.

Let's begin by finding out how many minutes Judy read in the first week. Since she read for 15 minutes each night and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of minutes she read in the first week is:

15 minutes/night × 7 nights = 105 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many pages she read in the first week. Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, the number of pages she read in a minute is:

2 pages/1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages/minute, approximately

So, the number of pages she read in the first week is:

105 minutes × 1.33 pages/minute ≈ 140 pages

We're given that she read a total of 100 pages in the second week. So, there is a discrepancy between the information given and what we calculated. The information provided about the number of pages she read in the second week seems incorrect, as it doesn't align with the information about her reading speed.

Based on the given information, it's not possible to calculate the number of pages she read in two weeks without correcting the inconsistency.

{The final answer is: The information provided is inconsistent and cannot be used to calculate the number of pages Judy read in two weeks.}</s>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

Now let's solve for N:

51 = 3 * N + 7
51 = 3 * N + 7 + (-7)
51 = 3 * N
N = 51 / 3

Since division by 3 cannot be done exactly, let's assume that Shiloh's nephew's age is an approximation, and the error is less than a year. In that case, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number:

Let's start with Liam. We know that he made $63 in total.

To find out how many lemonades Liam sold, we'll divide his total revenue by the price per lemonade.

{Liam sold} = {Total revenue} / {Price per lemonade}

{Liam sold} = $63 / $4

{Liam sold} = 15.75

Since Liam cannot sell a fraction of a lemonade, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So, Liam sold 15 lemonades.

Now let's calculate Mitchell's revenue based on the information given. We know he sold 21 lemonades, and each one cost $4.

{Mitchell's revenue} = {Number of lemonades sold} × {Price per lemonade}

{Mitchell's revenue} = 21 × $4

{Mitchell's revenue} = $84

To find out how many more dollars Mitchell made selling lemonade than Liam, we'll subtract Liam's revenue from Mitchell's revenue.

{Difference in revenue} = {Mitchell's revenue} - {Liam's revenue}

{Difference in revenue} = $84 - $63

Weekly requirements = Roses for the first shop + Roses for the second shop + Roses for the third shop
Weekly requirements = 20 roses + 15 roses + 30 roses

Weekly requirements = 65 roses

Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, to find out how many roses he is short, we need to subtract his weekly production from the weekly requirements:

Difference = Weekly requirements - Weekly production
Difference = 65 roses - 40 roses

Difference = 25 roses

So Ford needs to grow an additional 25 roses every week to meet the demands of all the flower shops.

But the question asks for the monthly requirement. There are 4 weeks in a month on average. So, we need to find the total number of extra roses Ford needs to produce every month:

Monthly requirement = Weekly requirement x 4
Monthly requirement = 25 roses x 4

The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
Cost of cheeses and condiments per sandwich = $0.70 (given that they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding.
- The cost of the new carpet is $12 per square foot.
- The cost of padding is $2 per square foot.

 since the area of the bedroom is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.
- Cost of new carpet and padding = $12/sf * 216 sf + $2/sf * 216 sf

Step 2: Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet.
Cost of removal = $4/sf * Area of bedroom = $4/sf * 216 sf

Step 3: Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet.
Cost of installation = $34/sf * Area of bedroom = $34/sf * 216 sf

Step 4: Add all the costs together to find the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of new carpet and padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation
{The final answer is $Total cost = ($12/sf * 216 sf + $2/sf * 216 sf) + $4/sf * 216 sf + $34/sf * 216 sf}
This simplifies to $6,144. Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is $6,144.</s>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.
The new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.
The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.

On average, how many birds did . Mack see ! in a day?
                 [/INST] To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day during the week, we first need to find the total number of birds he saw and the number of days.

1. The total number of birds Mack saw can be calculated by adding the number of birds he saw on each day: 50 (day 1 and 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + ? (day 7)
2. Since Mack saw 90 birds on day 7, the total number of birds he saw during the week is: 50 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 211
3. To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we divide the total number of birds he saw by the number of days: 211 ÷ 7 ≈ 30.14

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a bird, we need to round this number down or up depending on the context.If Mack is counting the number of birds for research purposes, he would likely round down to the nearest whole number because the difference between 30 and 31 birds could be significant. In this case, the final answer is: The average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 30.

On the other hand, if Mack is just casually counting the birds for his own interest, he might round up to the nearest whole number because one more bird wouldn't make a big difference. In this case, the final answer is: The average number of birds Mack saw per day is approximately 31.</s>","On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.

                    question:
                    Diane gave a number train a ; starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?
                 [/INST] Let's call the number Diane gave the train ""n"". According to the problem, the train initially had a value of 20, and the train's value after some steps is given by:

Final value = (n + (n/2)) * (n - 12)

Now, we need to find the value of ""n"" that would result in the given final value. To do this, we can simplify the equation first.

Step 1: Parentheses first
= (n + (n/2)) * (n - 12)

Step 2: Divide the number by 2 first
= (n + n/2) * (n - 12)

Step 3: Multiply n and n/2
= (n(1 + 1/2)) * (n - 12)

Step 4: Multiply the terms with the same base after simplifying
= n(1+1/2)(n - 12)

Step 5: Simplify further
= n(1+1/2)n - n(1+1/2)12
= n * (1+1/2)n * 1 - n * (1+1/2) * 12
= n * (1.5)n - n * (1.5)12

Now, we want to find the value of ""n"" that will result in the given final value. Let's call this final value ""x"" and set up the equation:

x = n * 1.5n - n * 1.5 * 12

Step 6: Distribute the multiplication term
x = n * 1.5n - 1.5 * 12 * n

Step 7: Solve for n
First, we focus on finding the coefficient of n, which is 1.5n:
1.5n = x / n

Next, we try to solve for n:
n = x / 1.5n => n = x / (1.5x/n) => n = x * (1/1.5)

Now we have:
n = x / (1.5) => n = (2x) / (3) => n = 2x / 3

Plug this back into our original equation:

x = (2x/3) * 1.5 * ((2x/3) - 12)

Step 8: Solve this equation for x:
First, let's simplify the equation:
x = (2x/3) * 1.5 * ((2/3)x - 12)

Next, we will solve for x:
x = 3x/2 * (2/3)x - 1.5 * 12
x = (3/2)x * (2/3)x - 12 * 3/2
x = (3/2)x^2 - 10.5x

To find the value of x, we can set up a quadratic equation to solve or consider numerical methods, but in this case, since we want a final value of a number train, we can't get a specific numerical answer without knowing Diane's initial value of the number train.

So, unfortunately, without knowing the initial value of the number train, we cannot find a definitive answer for the final value. However, we now have the equation x = (3/2)x^2 - 10.5x, which can be used to determine the final value if the starting value is given.

Therefore, if a definitive answer for the final value is needed, you must provide the initial value for the number train.

{The final answer is: We cannot find the final value of the number train without knowing the initial value.}</s>","If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48

                    Maggie's oven is malfunctioning. When she sets it to 450 the actual temperature is 468. If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set ? it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?
                 [/INST] To find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to when a recipe calls for 520 degrees, we first need to determine the percentage by which her oven is off.

Step 1: Find the percentage difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature.

The difference between the desired temperature (450) and the actual temperature (468) is:

Difference = | (Desired temperature - Actual temperature) |
Difference = | (450 - 468) |
Difference = | (-16) |
Difference = 16

To find the percentage difference, we need to divide the difference by the desired temperature:

Percentage difference = (Difference / Desired temperature) * 100%
Percentage difference = (16 / 450) * 100%

A calculator or spreadsheet is recommended to perform this calculation, as the percentage would be an approximation and may not be easily calculated without it:

Percentage difference ≈ 3.55%

Step 2: Apply the percentage difference to the desired temperature to determine the adjusted temperature.

To find the adjusted temperature, we add the percentage difference to the desired temperature:

Adjusted temperature = Desired temperature + (Desired temperature * Percentage difference)
Adjusted temperature = 520 + (520 * 0.0355)

Calculator or spreadsheet is recommended to perform this calculation:

Adjusted temperature ≈ 541.24

Since Maggie's oven can't be set to a decimal temperature, she should round up to the nearest 10 degree increment.

Step 3: Round up to the nearest 10-degree increment.

Adjusted temperature = Round(541.24, -1) * 10
Adjusted temperature = Round(540) * 10

The final answer is: {Maggie should set her oven to 540 degrees when a recipe calls for 520 degrees.}</s>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18
The oven is off by 4% because 18 / 450 x 100 = <<18/450*100=4>>4%
Therefore X + .04X = 520
Therefore 1.04X = 520
The temperature to set it is 500 because 520 / 1.04 = <<520/1.04=500>>500

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert both movie lengths into minutes.
The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. So, its length in minutes is 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. So, its length in minutes is 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Step 2: Add the lengths of both movies to find the total time Max will spend watching movies.
The total time Max will spend watching movies is the sum of the lengths of the first and second movies. That is, 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes.
To convert the total time from minutes to hours and minutes, we first divide the total number of minutes by 60 to get the number of hours. Then we find the remainder of the division of the total number of minutes by 60 to get the number of minutes in the second hour.

The total number of minutes Max will spend watching movies is 215 minutes. Dividing 215 by 60, we get 3 hours and 15 minutes (3.25 hours).

1. We know that 90 single use contacts last Pete 45 days. So, the number of contacts used per day is 90/45 = 2 contacts per day.
2. Since one box contains 90 contacts, Pete uses up one box in 45 days.
3. The cost of one box is $100.00.
4. The boxes are currently 10% off. So, the discounted price of one box is $100.00 - 10% * $100.00 = $90.00.
5. Since Pete uses one box in 45 days, the cost of one pair of contacts (lasting him 45 days) is $90.00.

                    Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 . calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, : which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, ! which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml of water , does ! she need to drink?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of calories Hannah burns during aerobics and running.
- During 2 hours of aerobics, she burns 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories.
- During 1 hour of running, she burns 1 hour * 600 calories/hour = <<1*600=600>>600 calories.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns.
Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running = 1000 calories + 600 calories = <<1000+600=1600>>1600 calories.

Step 3: Determine the amount of water Hannah needs to drink based on the number of calories she burns.
Since Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, the water she needs to drink for 1600 calories is (1600 calories / 200 calories) * 100 ml = <<1600/200*100=800>>800 ml.

{The final answer is 800 ml of water.}</s>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

                    question:
                    At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and ! green jelly beans.  On the outside of the jar is a note that reads, ""This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue . jelly beans , and 1% more green jelly beans than : blue jelly beans.""  If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain : than red jelly ! beans?
                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. According to the note, there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Let R be the number of red jelly beans and B be the number of blue jelly beans. So, we have R = B - 1% * B.
2. Similarly, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. So, we have G = B + 1% * B.
3. The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. So, we have R + B + G = 4500.
4. We need to find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans. So, we have G - R.
5. Substituting the expressions for R and G from steps 1 and 2 into step 4, we get G - (B - 1% * B) = 4500.
6. Simplifying the equation, we have 2G = 5B + 4500.
7. Solving for G, we get G = (5B + 4500) / 2.
8. Now, we need to find the difference between G and R. Substituting R = B - 1% * B from step 1 into this equation, we get G - (B - 1% * B) = (5B + 4500) / 2 - (B - 1% * B).
9. Simplifying the equation, we have G - R = [5B + 4500 - B + 1% * B] / 2.
10. Canceling out the common term B from the numerator, we get G - R = [4B + 4500 - 1% * B] / 2.
11. Since the problem states that there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, we know that R = 0.9B.
12. Substituting R = 0.9B into the equation from step 11, we get G - R = [4B + 4500 - 1% * (0.9B)] / 2.
13. Simplifying the equation, we get G - R = [4B + 4500 - 0.99B] / 2.
14.canceling out the common term B from the numerator, we get G - R = [3.01B + 4500] / 2.
15. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2(G - R) = 3.01B + 9000.
16. Simplifying the left side, we get G - R = 3.01B + 9000.
17. Subtracting 3.01B from both sides, we get G - R - 3.01B = 9000.
18. Rearranging terms, we get G = 3.01B + 9000.
19. Subtracting the number of red jelly beans R from the number of green jelly beans G, we have the difference as G - R = (3.01B + 9000) - 0.9B.
20.Simplifying the difference, we have G - R = 2.1B + 8100.

The final answer is: There are 2.1B + 8100 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans in the jar.</s>","If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans

The difference in typing speed is 5 WPM.

Step 2: Find the average of the first two measurements using the given formula for the average:
The average of two numbers, a and b, is given by the formula: (a + b) / 2

Average of 47 WPM and 52 WPM = (47 + 52) / 2

Step 3: Find the average of the three measurements.
Once we have the average of the first two measurements, and we know that the third measurement is 5 WPM more than the second, we can find the average of the three measurements:

The average of the three measurements = (Average of first two measurements + 5) / 1

Substitute the value of the average of the first two measurements:

The average of the three measurements = (51.5 + 5) / 1

Step 4: Solve for the average of the three measurements.

The average of the three measurements = 56.5 WPM

                 [/INST] To find the difference in Martin's weight after 5 weeks with Cheerios and donuts for breakfast, we first need to calculate how much he will weigh after eating each option for 5 weeks.

1. Cheerios for breakfast:
If Martin loses 1.25 pounds/week with Cheerios, then after 5 weeks, his weight loss will be:
Weight loss = 1.25 pounds/week * 5 weeks
{Weight loss = 6.25 pounds}

So, after 5 weeks with Cheerios for breakfast, Martin will weigh:
Initial weight - Weight loss
{Martin's weight with Cheerios = Initial weight - 6.25 pounds}

2. Donuts for breakfast:
If Martin gains 1.75 pounds/week with donuts, then after 5 weeks, his weight gain will be:
Weight gain = 1.75 pounds/week * 5 weeks
{Weight gain = 8.75 pounds}

So, after 5 weeks with donuts for breakfast, Martin will weigh:
Initial weight + Weight gain
{Martin's weight with donuts = Initial weight + 8.75 pounds}

3. Difference in weight:
To find the difference in Martin's weight between the two breakfast options, we'll subtract his weight with Cheerios from his weight with donuts:
Difference = Weight with donuts - Weight with Cheerios
{Difference = (Initial weight + 8.75 pounds) - (Initial weight - 6.25 pounds)}

Difference = Initial weight + 8.75 pounds - Initial weight + 6.25 pounds
Difference = 2.5 pounds

{The final answer is: Martin will weigh 2.5 pounds more after 5 weeks with donuts for breakfast than with Cheerios.}</s>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week

1. Alex invites 100 people via email.
2. Each invited person says they will bring 2 friends, so there will be an additional 100 * 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 guests.
3. Alex calls 10 friends to invite them, and 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses.
4. Each of the called friends brings one spouse, so there will be an additional 10 * 1 = <<10*1=10>>10 guests.
5. The spouses of the called friends also attend, so there will be an additional 10 * 1 = <<10*1=10>>10 guests.

Now, we can calculate the total number of seats Alex needs:

{The final answer is: 100 (invited by Alex) + 200 (invited by those she invited) + 10 (called friends) + 10 (their spouses) = <<100+200+10+10=310>>310}

                 [/INST] To determine how many days it takes for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to calculate how long it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height of 20 ft + 4 ft = 24 ft.

Let's find out how long it takes for the beanstalk to double its height:

1. The beanstalk is 4 ft tall to begin with.
2. Each day, the beanstalk doubles its height. So, the height of the beanstalk after one day is 4 ft * 2 = 8 ft.
3. After the second day, the beanstalk is 2^2 ft = 16 ft tall.
4. Following this pattern, the height of the beanstalk after n days would be 2^n ft.

Now let's find the value of n that makes the beanstalk taller than Mark's window:

5. We want the height of the beanstalk to be greater than 24 ft.
6. Setting up the inequality: 2^n > 24
7. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides: n > log2(24)
8. Calculating the logarithm: n > 4.53 (rounded up to three decimal places)
9. Since the height of the beanstalk can't be a fraction of a foot, we need to round up to the next whole number: n > 5
10. So, the beanstalk becomes taller than Mark's window (20 ft + 4 ft = 24 ft) after 5 days.

{The final answer is 5 days}</s>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                 [/INST] To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to calculate how many grams of protein he consumes in a day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Step 1: Protein consumed in a day
Protein in one cup of mushrooms = 3 grams
Weight of mushrooms John eats in a day = 200 grams

To find the protein consumed in a day, we multiply the protein in one cup by the number of cups John eats and then by the total weight of mushrooms he consumes in grams (since protein is given in grams and the weight of mushrooms is given in grams as well, this calculation will give us the correct answer).

Protein in one day = Protein per cup * Number of cups eaten per day * Total weight of mushrooms eaten
Protein in one day = 3 grams * (Total weight of mushrooms / Weight of one cup) * Total weight of mushrooms eaten
Protein in one day = 3 grams * (200 grams/100 grams) * 200 grams
Protein in one day = 6 * 2 * 200
Protein in one day = 2400 grams

Step 2: Protein consumed per week
We know that there are 7 days in a week. So to find the protein consumed per week, we multiply the protein consumed in a day by the number of days in a week.

Protein per week = Protein per day * Number of days in a week
Protein per week = 2400 grams * 7 days
Protein per week = 16,800 grams

{The final answer is: John gets 16,800 grams of protein per week from eating mushrooms.}</s>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

                 [/INST] To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we first need to find his current age and then add 3 years to it.

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's denote Jerry's current age as X. Then, 5 years ago, his age was X - 5.

Since Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the following equation:

X = 2(X - 5)

Solving for X, we get:

X = 2X - 10
X - 2X = -10
-X = -10
X = 10

So, Jerry's current age is 10 years old.

Now we can find out his age in 3 years: X + 3 = Jerry's age in 3 years.

Substituting Jerry's current age (X = 10), we get:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. {The final answer is: Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years}</s>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10

George needs to pay for 2 implants, each with a porcelain crown, so the total cost is $2500 x 2 = $<<2500*2=5000>>5000.

Step 3: Calculate the additional amount George needs to pay after the deposit.
George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the additional amount he needs to pay is $5000 - $600 = $<<5000-600=4940>>4940.

Step 4: Determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the additional amount.
George makes $15 per hour at work, so he needs to work for $4940 / $15 = $<<4940/15=330>>330 hours to cover the additional amount.

Therefore, {The final answer is George needs to work for 330 hours to pay for the dental work.}</s>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

                    question:
                    The three angles in , a triangle add up to 180 degrees. One angle is ? twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle. What is the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, in degrees?
                 [/INST] To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we first need to determine the measures of the two given angles. Let's call the smallest angle ""x"". Then, we know that:

Angle 1 = x [Given that one angle is the smallest]
Angle 2 = 2x [One angle is twice the smallest]
Angle 3 = 3x [One angle is three times the smallest]

Since the sum of all the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees:

Angle 1 + Angle 2 + Angle 3 = 180
x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combining like terms, we get:

6x = 180
x = 30

So, the smallest angle measures 30 degrees. Now we can find the measures of the other two angles:

Angle 2 = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees
Angle 3 = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees

Therefore, the triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the angles are in a right triangle, we know that the sum of the two smaller angles is always 90 degrees, so Angle 1 (the smallest angle) plus Angle 2 always equals 90 degrees.

Since Angle 2 measures 60 degrees, then Angle 1 must measure 30 degrees, and Angle 3 (the largest angle) must measure the remaining 90 degrees.

{The final answer is: The measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees}</s>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180
6x=180
x=<<30=30>>30
Then the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.

                    Colby wants to , buy some gumballs that cost a nickel each. . If he has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies, how many can he buy?
                 [/INST] To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to find the total amount of money he has in coins. Then, we can determine how many nickels he has and divide that number by the cost of one gumball to find out how many gumballs he can buy with his nickels alone. Since we have the number of each kind of coin, we can use the following equation:

Total amount of money = (Number of quarters) * (Value of a quarter) + (Number of dimes) * (Value of a dime) + (Number of nickels) * (Value of a nickel) + (Number of pennies) * (Value of a penny)

Given:
Number of quarters: 8
Number of dimes: 6
Number of nickels: 14
Number of pennies: 15

Value of a quarter: 25 cents = 25₵ = ¥0.25 = $0.25 = ₪0.10 (assuming we're converting)
Value of a dime: 10 cents = 10₵ = ¥0.10 = $0.10 = ₪0.05
Value of a nickel: 5 cents = 5₵ = ¥0.05 = $0.05 = ₪0.025
Value of a penny: 1 cent = 1₵ = ¥0.01 = $0.01 = ₪0.005

Calculate total amount of money:
Total amount of money = (8) * (25) + (6) * (10) + (14) * (5) + (15) * (1)

Total amount of money = (8) * (25) + (6) * (10) + (14) * (5) + (15)
Total amount of money = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
Total amount of money = 335

Now that we know Colby has $3.35, we can calculate how many gumballs he can buy with his nickels alone:

Number of gumballs with nickels = Total amount of nickels / Cost of one gumball

Number of gumballs with nickels = 14 * (1/5)
Number of gumballs with nickels = 7

Therefore, Colby can buy 7 gumballs with his nickels alone. However, he also has quarters, dimes, and pennies. It's possible there are enough coins in those denominations for him to buy more gumballs, or he might not be able to buy any more with those coins because their value is less than the cost of a gumball. Since we've only calculated how many gumballs he can buy with his nickels, the answer we've given is a lower bound on the total number of gumballs he can buy.

{Final answer: At least 7}. The exact number of gumballs Colby can buy depends on whether there are enough quarters, dimes, or pennies to also buy some gumballs.</s>","He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.

1. Dogs have 4 legs each, and there are 5 dogs in the store. So, the number of legs from dogs is 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
2. Cats also have 4 legs each, and there are 2 cats in the store. Therefore, the number of legs from cats is 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
3. Birds have 2 legs each, and there are 10 birds in the store. Consequently, the number of legs from birds is 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's find the total number of legs in the pet store by adding the number of legs from dogs, cats, and birds.

Total legs = 20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs.

Rotation per mile = 725 rotations
Miles driven per month = 400 miles

Total rotations per month = Rotation per mile * Miles driven per month
Total rotations per month = 725 rotations/mile * 400 miles/month
Total rotations per month = 290000 rotations/month

Number of washings from 2 pumps = 120

Cost of one pump = $24.00 / 120

Cost of one pump = $0.20 per wash

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost of one pump in cents is:

                    Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25. He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much ! money will Joe have left after the ? purchase?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shirt and shorts after the 30% discount.

- Cost of shirt: $25
- Discount rate: 30%

The discount amount is 30% of the cost of the shirt:

Discount = Cost of shirt * Discount rate
Discount = $25 * 0.3
Discount = $7.5

The discounted cost of the shirt is the original cost minus the discount:

Cost of shirt after discount = Cost of shirt - Discount
Cost of shirt after discount = $25 - $7.5
Cost of shirt after discount = $17.5

Similarly, the cost of shorts after discount:

- Cost of shorts: $35
- Discount rate: 30%

Discount = Cost of shorts * Discount rate
Discount = $35 * 0.3
Discount = $10.5

Cost of shorts after discount = Cost of shorts - Discount
Cost of shorts after discount = $35 - $10.5
Cost of shorts after discount = $24.5

Step 2: Add the discounted costs together to find the total amount spent.

Total amount spent = Cost of shirt after discount + Cost of shorts after discount
Total amount spent = $17.5 + $24.5
Total amount spent = $42

Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent from Joe's initial $50 to find the remaining balance.

Final answer:

Joe has { $18 } left after the purchase.</s>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pounds of butter Juan needs to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, we first need to determine how much butter is required to make 4 dozen croissants and then find out how much butter is needed for a week.

1. Butter required for 4 dozen croissants:
   It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, so the butter required for 4 dozen croissants is:

   Butter for 4 dozen = 4 dozen * Butter per dozen
   = 4 dozen * 1/4 pound
   = 1 pound

2. Butter required for a week (7 days):
   Juan makes 4 dozen croissants a day, so in a week (7 days), he'll make:

   Croissants per week = Croissants per day * Days per week
   = 4 dozen * 7 days
   = 28 dozen

   The butter required for 28 dozen croissants is:

   Butter for 28 dozen = 28 dozen * Butter per dozen
   = 28 dozen * 1/4 pound
   = 7 pounds

{The final answer is: Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make croissants for a week.}</s>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter

                    question:
                    John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  , His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?
                 [/INST] To find out how much John's research ended up costing, we'll calculate the cost for each month after the initial 5-month period.

First, we know that during the first 5 months, John had $100,000 in funding.

Next, we're told that every month after the first 5 cost 50% more than the previous month. So we'll calculate the monthly cost after 5 months, then find the cost for each subsequent month by multiplying the previous month's cost by 1.5 (since a 50% increase means multiplying by 1 + 0.5 = 1.5).

Let X be the cost for the 6th month.
X = Initial funding per month (from the 6th to 10th month) * 1.5
X = 100000 / 5 * 1.5
X = 240000

Now we have the cost for the 6th month. We can calculate the cost for the next months using the same formula:

7th month: 240000 * 1.5 = 360000
8th month: 360000 * 1.5 = 540000
9th month: 540000 * 1.5 = 810000
10th month: 810000 * 1.5 = 1,215,000

Since we only have funding for the first 5 months and then an additional month for each multiple of 5 after that, we can find the total cost by summing up the initial 5 months of funding and the funding for these additional months.

Total cost = Initial funding * 5 + Final funding for each additional month till the end of research
Total cost = 100000 * 5 + 240000 + 360000 + 540000 + 810000 + ...

As we can see, this is an infinite geometric sequence with the first term (a0) being 100,000 and the common ratio being 1.5. The sum of infinite geometric sequence is given by S = a0 / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a0 is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Total cost = 100000 * 5 + [100000 / (1 - 1.5)]
Total cost = 100000 * 5 + [100000 / (-0.5)]
Total cost = 100000 * 5 + 200000

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak, so the number of ounces of meat consumed by the first player is 6.

Step 2: Find the number of ounces of meat consumed by the second player.
The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip was an ounce in size. So, the number of ounces of meat consumed by the second player is 8.

Step 3: Find the number of ounces of meat consumed by the third player.
The third player ate a one-pound steak, so the number of ounces of meat consumed by the third player is 16 (since 1 pound = 16 ounces).

Step 4: Find the total number of ounces of meat consumed by all team members, excluding the fourth and fifth players.
Total number of ounces = ounces consumed by first player + ounces consumed by second player + ounces consumed by third player

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many hours of therapy John attended in a week.
John went to physical therapy twice a week for 2 hours each session. So, the number of hours he attended therapy in a week is: 2 sessions/week * 2 hours/session = 4 hours/week.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours of therapy John received during the 6-week period.
Total hours of therapy = hours per week * number of weeks
Total hours of therapy = 4 hours/week * 6 weeks = 24 hours.

Step 3: Determine the total cost of the therapy sessions based on the hourly rate.
The hourly rate of the therapy sessions is $125. Since John's total therapy took 24 hours, the total cost of the therapy would be: 24 hours * $125/hour = $3,000.

How many pieces of gum , does Jim have left : at ! the end of the day?
                 [/INST] To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews during the school day, on the way home, after dinner, and gives to his sister, and then subtract those amounts from the original 20-piece pack.

1. Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school. In an 8-hour school day, he chews gum for:

Number of pieces for the school day = Hours spent at school / Hours per piece
= 8 hours / 2 hours/piece
= 4 pieces

2. Jim chews 1 piece on the way home, so he chews an additional:

Number of pieces on the way home = 1 piece

3. Jim chews another 1 piece after dinner, so we add:

Number of pieces after dinner = 1 piece

4. Jim gives half of his remaining gum to his sister:

Half of Jim's remaining gum = (Remaining gum) / 2

5. Now we calculate the total number of pieces Jim has chewed or given away and find the remaining pieces:

Total pieces chewed or given away = School day gum + On the way home + After dinner + Given to sister
= 4 pieces + 1 piece + 1 piece + (Remaining gum / 2)
= 4 pieces + 1 piece + 1 piece + (10 pieces)
= 15 pieces

The total pieces Jim had were:

Total pieces Jim had = Original pack size
= 20 pieces

Subtract the pieces Jim chewed or gave away from the total Jim initially had:

Remaining pieces of gum = Total pieces Jim had - Total pieces Jim chewed or gave away
= 20 pieces - 15 pieces
= 5 pieces

{The final answer is: Jim has 5 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.}</s>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

Her age now = 16 - 12
Her age now = 4 years old

Step 3: Now, we need to find out how old Charmaine will be in 4 years from now.

Step 4: To find out her age in 4 years, we add 4 years to her current age:

Her age in 4 years = Her age now + 4

                 [/INST] Step 1: Convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kb per second to Mb per second.
1000 kb = 1 Mb, so we need to divide Ashley's connection speed in kb per second by 1000 to get the speed in Mb per second.

Step 2: Calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per second:
20 kb/s ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Step 3: Calculate Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour.
To achieve this, we need to multiply her connection speed in Mb per second by 60 for minutes in an hour and then by 60 again for hours in an hour.

For the remaining four days of the week, the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars than on each of the first three days. So for each of these days, the tow truck towed:
{10 - 4 = 6 cars}

We know there are three days with 10 cars each, and then four days with 6 cars each. So the total number of cars towed that week is:

Adam's height = 40 inches = 40 * 0.0833 feet = 3.332 feet

Step 2: Define the difference between Adam's height and the required height (4 feet or 48 inches).

Height difference = Required height – Adam's height = 48 inches – 3.332 feet * 12 inch/foot = 44.668 inches

Step 3: Determine how many inches Adam grows yearly and how many years it will take to reach the required height.

Years to grow the required height = Height difference / Annual growth rate = 44.668 inches / 2 inches/year = 22.3336 years

Step 4: Count the whole number of years since Adam was birth to reach the required height. Since Adam is growing 2 inches per year, we can calculate his age by doubling the number of years and rounding up to the nearest whole number.

1. Find the total cost of the 10 cars for James' company. To calculate this, we'll multiply the number of cars (10) by the cost of each car ($25,000): 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

2. Find the amount the company paid for the cars by finding 30% of the total cost. We'll calculate this by multiplying the total cost ($250,000) by 0.3 (which represents 30%): $250,000 * 0.3 = $75,000.

3. Find the profit for each car by subtracting the cost from the selling price: $25,000 (selling price) - $7,500 (company cost) = $17,500 (profit per car).

4. Find the commission for James by finding 10% of the profit for each car: $17,500 * 0.1 = $1,750 (commission per car).

5. Find the total commission James earned by multiplying the commission per car ($1,750) by the number of cars sold (10): $1,750 * 10 = $17,500.

Adding the commission to the money James didn't spend on buying the cars, we'll find the total amount of money he made: $75,000 (company cost) + $17,500 (commission) = $92,500.

Step 2: He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. So, the number of truck stamps is 16 + 3 = 19.

Step 3: He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. So, the number of rose stamps is 19 - 9 = 10.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to find out the difference in their speeds and then calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover that distance.

1. The difference in their speeds:
   Bob's speed = 55 miles per hour
   Tom's speed = 70 miles per hour
   Difference in their speeds = Bob's speed - Tom's speed
   Difference in their speeds = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

2. We can't have a negative difference in speed, so that means Bob is actually driving faster than Tom. To find out how long it takes Tom to catch up, we need to calculate how long it takes for Tom to cover the 75-mile distance between them, traveling at his own speed.

3. Time = Distance / Speed
   For Tom: Time = 75 miles / 70 miles per hour

4. Let's calculate the time:
   Time = 75 miles ÷ 70 miles per hour
   Time = 1.07 hours

Therefore, {The final answer is: It will take Tom approximately 1.07 hours to catch up with Bob}.</s>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.
2. We also know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi.
3. Naomi caught 17 fish.

Let's denote the number of fish Darren caught as D and the number of fish Tommy caught as T.

Using the information given, we can create two equations:

T = D +3 (Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren)
D = Naomi's catch - 6 (Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi)

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

T = (Naomi's catch - 6) +3

Solving for T, we see that:

T = Naomi's catch +1

So, Tommy caught one fish more than Naomi did.

{The final answer is: Tommy caught 18 fish}

It's important to remember that the given information might not necessarily represent the actual number of fish caught, but only the relationship between their catches based on the difference in the number of fish caught.</s>","Darren caught 17 - 6 = <<17-6=11>>11 fish

                 [/INST] To find out how many classes Manny can miss while still keeping the total cost below $10 per class, we first need to calculate the cost of each class that his parents are willing to pay for.

Cost per class = $60 (total cost of classes) / 10 (total number of classes)
Cost per class = $6

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the classes Manny attends from the total cost of $60 to find out how much his parents are willing to spend on classes he misses.

Budget for missed classes = $60 (total cost) - ($6 * number of classes attended)

To find out how many classes Manny can miss while staying within the budget, we can set up the equation:

$6 (cost per class he attends) + $x (cost of classes he misses) ≤ $60

We know that the cost of each class Manny attends is $6, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$6 (cost per class he attends) + $x (cost of classes he misses) = $60
$6 + $x = $60
$x = $54

Since Manny can't actually attend a negative number of classes, we need to subtract the number of classes he can attend from the total number of classes:

Number of classes he can attend = Total number of classes - Number of classes he can miss
Number of classes he can attend = 10 - (Cost of missed classes / Cost per class he attends)
Number of classes he can attend = 10 - ($54 / $6)
Number of classes he can attend = 10 - 9
Number of classes he can attend = 1

So, Manny's parents would only sign him up for one more class if he misses some sessions, and any additional missed classes could result in them not signing him up again.

Therefore, if Manny wants to continue with the karate classes after missing some sessions, he'll have to find alternative ways to pay for those missed classes, or try negotiating with the karate school to reduce the cost per class or offer a payment plan.
{The final answer is: Manny can miss one class while staying within his parents' budget, but additional missed classes could result in them not signing him up again.}</s>","He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many customers Jewel processes in a week by finding the number of customers she processes daily and then multiplying that by the number of days in a week.

Customers processed by Jewel daily = 50
Number of days in a week = 7

Customers processed by Jewel weekly = Customers processed daily * Number of days in a week
= 50 * 7
= 350

Step 2: Since Julie processes customers exactly twice as fast as Jewel, we can find the number of customers Julie processes daily and then weekly by finding twice the number of customers Jewel processes daily.

Customers processed daily by Julie = 2 * Customers processed daily by Jewel

Customers processed daily by Julie = 2 * 50
= 100

Customers processed weekly by Julie = Customers processed daily by Julie * Number of days in a week
= 100 * 7
= 700

Step 3: To find the total weekly production for the two cashiers, we simply add the number of customers they can process separately in a week.

Total weekly production = Customers processed weekly by Jewel + Customers processed weekly by Julie

First, let's find the price of one apple:
Four apples cost $5.20, so the price of one apple is $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

Next, let's find the price of one orange:
Three oranges cost $3.30, so the price of one orange is $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

Now, let's calculate the cost of 5 apples:
5 apples * $1.30/apple = $6.50.

And finally, let's calculate the cost of 5 oranges:
5 oranges * $1.10/orange = $5.50.

So, the total cost for Clyde will be the cost of 5 apples + the cost of 5 oranges:
$6.50 (apples) + $5.50 (oranges) = $12.00.

The final answer is: Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.</s>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.

Next, let's find the cost of 10 dress pants for each suit. We're told that the cost of the dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of the suit.

Step 6: Substitute S = 60 into the equation: (60 + 4)/2 - 3

Step 7: Calculate the result: (64)/2 - 3

Step 8: Simplify the expression by doing the division and subtraction: 31.5 - 3

Step 9: The final answer is: {The final answer is 31 years old} (approximately) for Steve's son's wife. However, since ages are given in whole numbers, it's important to note that there's a discrepancy in the given problem, and it might be more consistent to round up Steve's wife's age to 44 years old, making their son's age 32 and his wife's age 31 (approximately). This results in a more plausible family age distribution.</s>","Steve's wife is 60+4=<<60+4=64>>64 years old.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that the bag of flour was divided into 8 portions, each of 2 kilograms.
2. Therefore, the total amount of flour in the bag before it was divided was:
   Total flour = Number of portions * Portion size
   Total flour = 8 * 2 kg
   Total flour = 16 kg

3. The question asks for the amount of flour in three bags before they were divided into portions. Since each portion is 2 kg, three portions would be 3 * 2 kg = 6 kg.

4. To find the amount of flour in three bags before they were divided, we need to find out how much flour was in the bag before producing three portions of 2 kg each.
5. Since each portion is 2 kg, the size of the original bag was:
   Original bag size = Number of portions * Portion size
   Original bag size = 3 * 2 kg
   Original bag size = 6 kg

{The final answer is 6 kg.} This is the amount of flour that was in three bags before they were divided into portions of 2 kg each.</s>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.
So, there are 16 x 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 kilograms of flour in 3 bags.

Step 2: Calculate the number of miles Stanley biked:
Miles biked by Stanley = Speed * Time
= 10 miles per hour * 2.5 hours
= 25 miles

Step 3: Add the number of miles biked by Alisa and Stanley to find the total miles:
Total miles = Miles biked by Alisa + Miles biked by Stanley
= 54 miles + 25 miles

1. Bill can dig through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour. To dig through 24 feet of soil, it will take him:
   Time to dig through soil = Amount of soil to dig through / Digging rate
   = 24 feet / 4 feet per hour
   = 6 hours

2. Bill can dig through clay at a rate of 2 feet per hour. To dig through 8 feet of clay, it will take him:
   Time to dig through clay = Amount of clay to dig through / Digging rate
   = 8 feet / 2 feet per hour
   = 4 hours

3. To find the total time it takes Bill to dig the well, we need to add the time it takes to dig through both the soil and the clay:
   Total time to dig the well = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay

After 1 week: Fishio received 2000 likes.

After 3 weeks (3 weeks after the initial 1 week): The number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, the number of likes after 3 weeks was 70 * 2000 = 140000 likes.

Step 2: Add the new number of likes received recently.

New number of likes = 140000 (likes after 3 weeks) + 20000 (new likes)

So,
New number of likes = 150000

What is the ! difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara bought on Tuesday before the discount.
Cost of one pomegranate = $20
Number of pomegranates bought = 20
Total cost before discount = Cost of one pomegranate * Number of pomegranates
Total cost before discount = $20 * 20 = $400

Step 2: Calculate the discount Clara got.
Discount = $2

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Clara actually paid for on Tuesday.
Cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Cost after discount = $400 - $2 = $398

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila bought on Wednesday before the discount.
Cost of one pomegranate = $30
Number of pomegranates bought = 20
Total cost before discount = Cost of one pomegranate * Number of pomegranates
Total cost before discount = $30 * 20 = $600

Step 5: Calculate the discount Sheila got.
Discount = 10% of $600
Discount = 0.1 * $600 = $60

Step 6: Calculate the cost of the pomegranates Sheila actually paid for on Wednesday.
Cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount
Cost after discount = $600 - $60 = $540

Step 7: Find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days.
Difference = |Cost for Clara on Tuesday - Cost for Sheila on Wednesday|

Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. . Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.
                 [/INST] Let's denote the sales from green hats in the first month as x.
We know that:
- Sales from red hats = $400
- Sales from green hats = 2 * Sales from red hats = 2 * $400 = $800
- Sales from red hats + Sales from green hats = Total sales in the first month

Therefore, Total sales in the first month = $400 + $800 = $1200

Since sales from green hats were half the total sales from the first month, we have:

Sales from green hats = $1200 / 2 = $600

Now, in the second month, sales from green hats were 3/4 of the total sales from the first month. So, we have:

Total sales in the second month = Total sales in the first month * 3/4 = $1200 * 3/4 = $960

Sales from green hats in the second month = $960 / 2 = $480

Therefore, the total sales from red hats in the second month = $960 - $480 = $480

So,
- Sales from red hats in the first month = $400
- Sales from red hats in the second month = $480
- Sales from green hats in the first month = $600
- Sales from green hats in the second month = $480

Thus, the total sales in two months = $400 + $480 + $600 + $480 = $1960

We're told that the first hour costs $15.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of each additional hour.
Each hour after the first costs twice the cost of the first hour. In other words, each additional hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Since James paid for 3 hours, the total cost is the cost of the first hour plus the cost of the 2 additional hours: $15 (first hour) + $30 ($15 * 2 for both additional hours) = $45.

Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. So, 1 serving requires 2 deviled egg halves.

Step 2: Calculate the number of servings for all her guests.
If each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, then the total number of egg halves required is:
Number of guests * Servings per guest
= 16 guests * 3 servings per guest
= 48 egg halves

Step 3: Calculate the number of whole eggs needed, since we know 1 whole egg makes 2 egg halves.
Number of egg halves required * Number of egg halves per whole egg
= 48 egg halves * 2 egg halves per whole egg
= 24 whole eggs

Step 4: Convert the number of whole eggs to dozens.
Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs required is:
Number of whole eggs / Number of eggs in a dozen
= 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen
= 2 dozens + 0.5 dozens

1. It takes Finley 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It takes her 20 minutes more to cook pork. So, the cooking time for pork is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.
3. Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, the cooking time for beans is (50 + 30)/2 = 40 minutes.
4. The total cooking time for all the food is the sum of the cooking times for rice, pork, and beans. So, the total cooking time is 30 minutes for rice + 50 minutes for pork + 40 minutes for beans = 120 minutes.

Cost of 1/2 pound of almonds: 1/2 * $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts: 1/3 * $15 = $5 (rounded to the nearest dollar)
Total cost for 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts: $5 + $5 = $10

Step 2: Determine the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts separately.

                    . Lee rears , only sheep ? and geese on his farm.  If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, how many sheep live on Lee's ? farm?
                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we'll need to calculate the number of legs and heads for each type of animal and then find the number of sheep based on the given information.

First, let's find out how many legs and heads each animal type has:
1. Sheep have 4 legs each, so the number of legs for all sheep is Legs (sheep) = Number of sheep * Legs per sheep.
2. Geese have 2 legs each, and we know there is 1 goose head for each goose, so the number of heads for all geese is Heads (geese) = Number of geese.

Now, we have two equations with the same left side (number of legs):
1. Legs (sheep) + Legs (geese) = 70
2. Number of sheep * 4 + Number of geese * 2 = 70

To find the number of sheep, we can first solve the second equation for the number of sheep:
Number of sheep = (70 - Number of geese * 2) / 4

Now, we know there are 20 heads in total. We've already found that the Heads (geese) = Number of geese, so we can set Heads (sheep) = Number of sheep to check if our solution for the number of sheep is correct:
Headers (sheep) = Number of sheep

However, since we don't know the exact number of geese, we cannot directly find the number of sheep from the given information alone.

Therefore, the problem has an infinite number of solutions, depending on the value of the number of geese.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the exact number of sheep from the given information without knowing the number of geese.</s>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

- A week has 7 days.
- The more expensive brand of coffee costs $5 per pound + 20% = $5 + 0.2 * $5 = $6 per pound.

Cost of coffee for a week = 1 pound/day * 7 days/week * $6/pound = $42

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the donut.

Cost of donut = $2

                 [/INST] Let's call the cost of the apple pie ""x"". We know that Gus spent a total of $20.00. Here's a step-by-step analysis of his purchases and the cost of the apple pie:

1. Gus bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, so the cost of the chips is 2 × $2 = $4.
2. He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.
3. He also bought a bottle of soda for $1.

Now we can set up an equation to find the cost of the apple pie (x):

Total Amount Spent = Cost of Chips + Cost of Fried Chicken + Cost of Soda + Cost of Apple Pie
$20 = $4 + $8 + $1 + x

To find the cost of the apple pie (x), we need to subtract the known costs from the total amount spent:

x = $20 - $4 - $8 - $1
x = $20 - $13
x = $7

So, the cost of the apple pie is $7.

{The final answer is: The apple pie cost $7.}</s>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00

The class meets 4 times a week, so he attends 4 x 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 classes per week.
The class lasts for 2 hours each time, so he spends 20 hours per week in class.
The class lasts for 6 weeks, so he spends 20 hours/week x 6 weeks = <<20*6=120>>120 hours in total.

Step 2: Determine how many new recipes John learns per hour of class time.
He learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, so he learns 1 recipe / (1.5 hours) = <<1/1.5=0.666666667>>0.67 recipes per hour.

Step 3: Find the total number of recipes John learns.
He learns 0.67 recipes per hour and spends a total of 120 hours in class, so he learns 0.67 recipes/hour x 120 hours = <<0.666666667*120=79.99999999999999>>80 recipes.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount of money Kassidy has as K. We know that Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, so Rayna's amount is R = K + 60.

We also know that Kassidy has 3/4 the amount of money Aurelia has. So, Aurelia's amount is A = 4/3 * K.

We're given that Aurelia has $120. So, we have the equation 4/3 * K = 120. Solving for K, we get:

K = 120 * (3/4) = $120 * (3/4) * (4/3) = $120 * 1 = $120

So, Kassidy has $120 and Rayna has $120 + 60 = $180.

Now, we want to find out how much each would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them. So, let's find the total amount of money they have and then divide that by the number of people:

Total money = $120 (Kassidy) + $180 (Rayna) = $300

1. Each quarter in Sarah's basketball game lasts 12 minutes.
2. There are 4 quarters in total. So, the normal duration of the game would be:
   Normal duration = Quarters × Duration of each quarter
   Normal duration = 4 quarters × 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes
3. However, there was a tie during the last quarter, which led to an extension of the game. The last quarter lasted longer than the regular duration of 12 minutes.
   Since the extension lasted for 5 minutes, the total duration of the last quarter was:
   Last quarter duration = 12 minutes (normal) + Extension of 5 minutes = 17 minutes
4. To find the total duration of the game, we need to sum up the duration of the normal quarters and the extended last quarter.
5. Thus, the total duration of the game was:
   Total duration = Normal quarters duration + Last quarter duration
   Total duration = (4 quarters × 12 minutes/quarter) + 17 minutes
   Total duration = 48 minutes + 17 minutes = 65 minutes

                 [/INST] To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we first need to determine the amount of each ingredient required for one muffin and then multiply that by the number of muffins.

1. For one muffin, Svetlana needs:
   - 5 tablespoons of flour
   - 3 tablespoons of sugar
   - 0.25 tablespoons of salt

2. Let's find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for one muffin:

   Total Dry Ingredients = Flour + Sugar + Salt
   Total Dry Ingredients = 5 tbsp + 3 tbsp + (0.25 tbsp)
   Total Dry Ingredients = 8.25 tbsp

3. To find the total amount of dry ingredients required for 16 muffins, multiply the amount for one muffin by the number of muffins:

   Total Dry Ingredients for 16 Muffins = Total Dry Ingredients per Muffin * Number of Muffins
   Total Dry Ingredients for 16 Muffins = 8.25 tbsp * 16
   Total Dry Ingredients for 16 Muffins = 132 tbsp

{The final answer is 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients are needed to make 16 muffins.}</s>","5 + 3 + 0.25 = <<5+3+0.25=8.25>>8.25 tablespoons

                 [/INST] To find the amount of candy each person would have if they share it equally, we first need to find the total amount of candy they had together.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of candy.
Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 lb + 5 lb + 4 lb
{Step 1 answer: The total amount of candy is 12 pounds}

Now, we can divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it to find the amount of candy each person would have.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of candy each person would have.
Amount of candy per person = Total candy / Number of people
Amount of candy per person = 12 lb / 3
{Step 2 answer: Each person would have approximately 4 lb  aug 1/3 lb of candy}

However, since we can't have a fraction of a pound, we need to either round up or down. Giving Aaron an additional 1/3 lb would make him have more than the others, so we'll round down for Robert and Cindy and up for Aaron.

So,

Robert would have approximately 4 lb of candy.
Cindy would have approximately 4 lb of candy.
Aaron would have approximately 4 lb and 1/3 lb (or 5 lb total).

Therefore, the final answer is: Robert and Cindy would have approximately 4 lb each, and Aaron would have approximately 5 lb of candy.</s>","Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy
Since there are three of them (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), they divide the candy into 3 equal portions. 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 pounds of candy

Cost of type B candies = 10 * $0.75
Cost of type B candies = $7.5

Step 2: Find the total cost of candies Adam bought.
Total cost of candies = Cost of type A candies + Cost of type B candies
Total cost of candies = $3.5 + $7.5
Total cost of candies = $11.0

Step 3: Find the difference between the amount Adam paid and the total cost of the candies.

1. We know that Christina had twelve good days in the first eight days, eight bad days in the second eight days, and the rest were neutral. Since there were eight good days and eight bad days, there were also eight neutral days. In total, there were twenty-four days with known moods (twelve good days, eight bad days, eight neutral days).
2. The problem states that the last three days were good, neutral, and good. So, the last three days add up to one good day and two neutral days.
3. Therefore, Christina has had a total of twenty-five days with recorded moods, and there are three days left in the month (assuming a thirty-day month).
4. Christina has had twelve good days in the first eight days, twelve good days in the last three days, and one good day in between (for a total of fifteen good days).
5. We know that there were eight bad days and twelve good days (including the last three) for a total of twenty-one recorded moods. Since there are twenty-eight moods recorded (twenty-five that we know about and the three remaining), and we have accounted for twenty-one, then there must be seven additional good days.
6. {The final answer is: Christina has twenty-two good days in total (fifteen that we know about and seven more that we determined from the information given)}.

1. Janey has 3 more books than 2 * x (twice the number of Sally's books).
2. Janey has 21 ! books.

Now, let's find the value of Sally's books (x) by solving this equation step by step:

Step 1: Janey has 21 ! more books than Sally, so Sally has: x = 21 ! - 3

Step 2: Factor out 1! from 21!: x = (20!)(1 + 1)

Step 3: Use the fact that 1! = 1, since there's only 1 way to arrange a single item: x = 20! * 2

Step 4: Calculate 20!: 20! = 20 × 19 × 18 × 17 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

Step 5: Replace 20! back into the equation: x = 20! * 2

Step 6: Multiply: x = 20! * 2 = 2 * 20!

We have found that Sally has 2 * 20! = 2 * (20 × 19 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1) = 2 * (20!), which is 2 times the factorial of 20.

                 [/INST] To find the number of days it takes for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow to a height of 600 inches, we need to determine the total number of inches the bamboo grows in one day and then divide the target height by the daily growth rate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

Step 1: Convert the current height (given in feet) to inches.
1 foot = 12 inches
20 feet = 20 * 12 inches = 240 inches

Step 2: Calculate the daily growth rate in inches.
The daily growth rate is given as 30 inches per day.

Step 3: Find the number of days required for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.
days = (target height) / (daily growth rate)
days = 600 inches / 30 inches/day = 20 days

{The final answer is: It will take 20 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.}</s>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. James currently has 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, each dog has 1 toy.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so James needs 8 more toys.
3. Before leaving, James thought there were the same number of dogs as when he arrived. However, there are now twice as many dogs as when he left. Let's call the initial number of dogs x.

                 [/INST] Let's call the total amount of money in the savings account X. We know that Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, so his contribution is 2/5 * X. After Dylan's investment, there is a remaining amount of money in the account, which is (X - 2/5 * X) = 3/5 * X.

Next, Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, so her contribution is 2/3 * (3/5 * X) = 1/3 * X.

The total amount invested by the three people is $1200, so the sum of their individual contributions is X + 2/5 * X + 1/3 * X. This can be simplified by combining the terms: X + 2X/5 + X/3.

To find the value of X, we can use the fact that 1X = $1200, so X = $1200. Now we can find Skyler's contribution by subtracting Dylan's and Frances' contributions from the total amount: X - (2/5 * X) - (1/3 * X).

Simplifying this expression, we get X(1 - 2/5 - 1/3) = X(4/15). This means X = 15X/4. Solving for X, we find X = $600.

Now we can find Skyler's contribution by subtracting Dylan's and Frances' contributions from the total amount: X - (2/5 * X) - (1/3 * X) = $1200 - (2/5 * $600) - (1/3 * $600).

                    question:
                    Shania is designing her own dress, and decides to make it a longer dress by extending the dress by : 50% of its original length. She also adds 20cm to the bottom of . the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?
                 [/INST] To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the given length of the final design.

Given: The final design is 140cm long.

1. Shania added 20cm to the bottom of the dress, so the length of the dress before this addition was 120cm.
2. She extended the length of the dress by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length of the dress ""x"". This means:
50% of x = x / 2
3. After doubling the original length and adding the 20cm, Shania ended up with a longer dress that was 140cm. So we can set up an equation:
x + x/2 + 20 = 140
4. Solving for ""x"", we first combine like terms:
x + x/2 + 20 = 140
x + x/2 = 120
5. To get ""x"" by itself, we need to isolate it:
x + x/2 = 120
x = 120 - x/2
x = 240/3
6. Since ""x"" represents the original length of the dress, the answer must be in whole centimeters. So we need to find the greatest common divisor of 240 and 3 to simplify the fraction.

The greatest common divisor of 240 and 3 is 120. Therefore, we divide both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by their greatest common divisor:

x = 240/3 = (2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 5 * 5 * 10)/(3 * 3) = 1600/9 = 178.89cm (approximately)

However, since Shania could only work with whole centimeter measurements, it is more likely that the original length was meant to be 178cm.

{The original length of the dress was 178cm.}</s>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.
Let's assume the dress was originally x cm in length.
Half the original length is x/2.
Adding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120
3/2x = 120
The orginal length is x= 80 cm

                 [/INST] To find out how long it took Chris to mow the lawn using a combination of ""turtle"" mode and ""rabbit"" mode, we first need to determine how long it takes him to mow half the lawn in each mode.

1. In ""turtle"" mode, Chris can mow half the lawn in 1 hour = 60 minutes.
2. In ""rabbit"" mode, Chris can mow half the lawn in 40 minutes.

The total time it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn in each mode is:
1. In ""turtle"" mode: 1 hour = 60 minutes.
2. In ""rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes.

Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, the total time it took him to mow the entire lawn is the sum of the time it took to mow half the lawn in each mode:

Total mowing time = Time mowed in ""turtle"" mode + Time mowed in ""rabbit"" mode
= 60 minutes (for half the lawn in ""turtle"" mode) + 40 minutes (for half the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode)
= 100 minutes (since we added the times for the whole lawn, not just half)

                 [/INST] To find the age of one of the twins, let's follow these steps:

1. Let the age of one twin be X. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the other twin (and the age of one triplet) is X - 7.
2. The sum of their ages is given as 44. So we have:
   X (age of one twin) + (X - 7) (age of the other twin) = 44
3. To solve for X, we can simplify the equation as follows:
   X + X - 7 = 44
  2X - 7 = 44
4. Now we need to find the value of X. To do this, we first add 7 to both sides to get X equal to a number:
   2X = 51
   X = 51/2
5. However, since ages are whole numbers, X must be an integer. So we need to check if 51 is an odd number (which would result in two different integers for the twins' ages). If it is, we subtract 7 from the larger age to find the age of one twin. If it's not, the ages cannot produce the given condition.

Let's check if 51 is odd:
51 % 2 = 1 (51 is odd)

Now we can find the age of one of the twins:
X = (51 + 7)/2 = 28 (since one twin is 7 years older than the other)

{The final answer is: One of the twins is 28 years old.}</s>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)
Triplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T

2T + 14 + 3T = 44
5T + 14 = 44

2. John has 3 hours (or 180 minutes) before he has to eat dinner.
3. To calculate how many minutes John can nap, we need to find the difference between the total time he has before dinner and the time he spends on his homework.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of the lollipops Manolo bought initially.
Manolo bought 5 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So the cost of the initial lollipops is:
Cost of initial lollipops = Number of lollipops * Cost of each lollipop
= 5 * $0.40
= $2.00

Step 2: Find the cost of the candies Manolo bought.
Manolo bought 4 candies and they cost $0.80 in total. So the cost of the candies is:
Cost of candies = Number of candies * Cost of each candy
Since we don't know the cost of each candy, we cannot find this value directly. However, we know that the cost of 4 candies is $0.80.

Step 3: Find the cost of 10 lollipops.
Manolo wants to find the cost of 10 lollipops, and each lollipop costs $0.40. So the cost of 10 lollipops is:
Cost of 10 lollipops = Number of lollipops * Cost of each lollipop
= 10 * $0.40
= $4.00

Step 4: Find the cost of 10 candies, but we cannot do this directly since we don't know the cost of each candy.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the initial purchase.
Total cost of initial purchase = Cost of initial lollipops + Cost of candies
= $2.00 + $0.80
= $2.80

We cannot determine the cost of 10 candies and 10 lollipops since we don't have enough information, specifically, the cost of each candy. The final answer is: {We cannot determine the cost of 10 candies and 10 lollipops without knowing the cost of each candy.}</s>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.

                    Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares. The comforter had 14 , red squares, 4 more blue squares than red squares, , 6 more green : squares than blue squares, and 12 fewer : white squares than green squares.  How many square feet is Brittany's comforter?
                 [/INST] To find the total square footage of Brittany's comforter, we first need to determine the number of each colored square:

1. Red squares: 14
2. Blue squares: 14 + 4 = 18
3. Green squares: 18 + 6 = 24
4. White squares: 24 - 12 = 12

Now, let's calculate the square footage of each color:

1. Red squares: 1 foot × 1 foot × number of red squares = 1 foot × 1 foot × 14
2. Blue squares: 1 foot × 1 foot × number of blue squares = 1 foot × 1 foot × 18
3. Green squares: 1 foot × 1 foot × number of green squares = 1 foot × 1 foot × 24
4. White squares: 1 foot × 1 foot × number of white squares = 1 foot × 1 foot × 12

To find the total square footage, we add up the square footage of each color:

Total square footage = Square footage of red squares + Square footage of blue squares + Square footage of green squares + Square footage of white squares

Total square footage = (1 foot × 1 foot × 14) + (1 foot × 1 foot × 18) + (1 foot × 1 foot × 24) + (1 foot × 1 foot × 12)

Total square footage = (14) + (18) + (24) + (12) square feet

The final answer is: The comforter is 58 square feet.</s>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of regular chairs. Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, there must be 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 regular chairs.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chairs Tom and the babies will require. There are 42 adults, so there will be 42 chairs needed for them. The number of chairs for the babies is not given directly, but since each adult requires one chair and each baby requires a high chair (which counts as one chair), the babies will need 15 chairs. So the total number of chairs required is 42 (for the adults) + 15 (for the babies) = <<42+15=57>>57 chairs.

Step 3: Determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get. The number of chairs Mia already has is the number of high chairs + the number of regular chairs = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs. Therefore, she needs to get the difference between the total number of chairs Tom and the babies will require and the number of chairs she already has: 57 (total chairs) - 48 (chairs she has) = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs.

{The final answer is: 9 more chairs are required.}</s>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs

However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that Class 3B needs a minimum of 400 points to go on a trip.

2. Adam has collected 50 points.
3. Betty has collected 50 + 30% of 50 = 50 + (0.3 * 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points.
4. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.
5. Marta has collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.

6. To find out how many points the whole class has collected, we add up the points of Adam, Betty, and Tom. We don't have information about Marta's points yet, but we'll find that out in the next step.
7. We have: 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) = 150 points in total.

8. Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 3 * 35 = 105 points.
9. In total, the class has: 150 (Adam, Betty, and Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

10. The class is missing: 400 (minimum threshold) - 255 (currently collected points) = 145 points.

{The final answer is: The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.}</s>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

Aiden and 12 friends make 13 people. Then, they meet with 7 more friends, making a total of 13 + 7 = <<13+7=20>>20 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of seats needed.
Since each seat holds one person and each person is in the group, we don't need to buy extra seats. So, there's no need to calculate the number of seats based on the group size.

Step 3: Calculate the number of drinks and snacks for each seat.
Each seat has room for two drinks and three snacks, so that's 2 drinks + 3 snacks = <<2+3=5>>5 items per seat.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of items the group buys.
Since there are 20 people in the group, and each person's seat has room for 5 items (2 drinks and 3 snacks), the group buys a total of 20 people * 5 items = <<20*5=100>>100 items.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of all the items.

2. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. (Gordy's truck can carry G + 800)
3. The three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds. (G + Gordy's truck capacity + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600)

Now we'll solve for Gary's truck capacity (X):

Substitute the known value of G (4,000) into the equation:
4,000 + (4,000 + 800) + X = 11,600

Simplify the equation:
4,000 + 4,800 + X = 11,600

Add the first two terms:
8,800 + X = 11,600

Subtract 8,800 from both sides of the equation:

Since there are 8 males (including Larry) and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, each male consumed 3 dumplings + 1 = 4 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings consumed by males is: 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings.

Step 3: Find the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry.
Since there were no leftovers, the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the sum of the number of dumplings eaten by females and males: 18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings.

Step 1: Determine the total amount of money based on the ratio 3:2.
3 parts represent Gerald's share, and 2 parts represent Julia's share.
Total parts = 3 (Gerald's share) + 2 (Julia's share) = 5 parts.
Total amount of money = $100

                 [/INST] Let's call the speed of Martha's turtle ""x"" feet per second. We know that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, so the cat's speed is 5x feet per second. We're given that the cat runs at 15 feet/second.

Using the given information, we can set up the following equation:

5x = 15

To find the speed of the turtle, we'll first divide both sides of the equation by 5:

x = 15/5
x = 3 feet/second

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can determine how far it can crawl in 40 seconds:

distance = speed * time

So, the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds is:

distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
distance = 120 feet

{The final answer is 120 feet}.</s>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

X = 0.4 * Total Water from Colorado River

Step 2: We also know that 80% of this water is used for industrial purposes. Let's represent this quantity as Y.
Y = 0.8 * 0.4 * Total Water from Colorado River

Step 3: To find out how much water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to subtract the industrial water usage from the total water used by the city.
Non-Industrial Water Usage = X - Y

Step 4: Let's find the value of Non-Industrial Water Usage.
Non-Industrial Water Usage = 0.4 * Total Water from Colorado River - 0.8 * 0.4 * Total Water from Colorado River
Non-Industrial Water Usage = 0.4 * Total Water from Colorado River (1 - 0.8)

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find how many quarts of chocolate ice cream are made in one hour.
Since they make 100 quarts in 2 hours, we can find out how many quarts are made in one hour:
Chocolate ice cream production per hour = Total chocolate ice cream / Production time
= 100 quarts / 2 hours
= 50 quarts/hour

Step 2: Find how many quarts of vanilla ice cream are made in one hour.
They make 50 quarts in 4 hours. To find the hourly production, we divide the number of quarts produced by the time it took:
Vanilla ice cream production per hour = Total vanilla ice cream / Production time
= 50 quarts / 4 hours
= 12.5 quarts/hour

Step 3: Find the hourly ice cream production rate of both flavors in combined terms.
Since chocolate ice cream is produced at a rate of 50 quarts/hour and vanilla ice cream is produced at a rate of 12.5 quarts/hour, the combined hourly production rate for both flavors is the sum of their individual hourly rates:
Combined hourly ice cream production = Chocolate ice cream production + Vanilla ice cream production
= 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour
= 62.5 quarts/hour

Step 4: Find the total number of quarts produced in 48 hours.
To find the total number of quarts produced in 48 hours, we multiply the hourly ice cream production rate by the number of hours:
Total quarts produced = Combined hourly ice cream production * Hours
= 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours
= 3,000 quarts
Therefore,

2 scoops * $1.50/scoop = $3.00

Step 2: Subtract the cost of 2 scoops from Erin's available budget.
$6.00 - $3.00 = $3.00

Step 3: Determine how many free scoops Erin can get with the remaining $3.00.
$3.00 / $1.50/scoop = 2 scoops (approximately)

Step 4: Since Erin can get only 1 free scoop in a sale, she needs to buy 1 more scoop to get the third scoop for free.
Total number of scoops she needs to buy = 2 (from her own budget) + 1 (to get the third scoop free) = 3 scoops

First, let's calculate how many pieces of candy Ginger eats in two weeks. We know that Ginger eats 4 pieces a day:

Number of pieces Ginger eats in 2 weeks = Daily pieces eaten * Number of days in 2 weeks

We know that there are 7 days in a week, so there are 14 days in 2 weeks.

Number of pieces Ginger eats in 2 weeks = 4 * 14
Number of pieces Ginger eats in 2 weeks = 56 pieces

So, Ginger will have eaten 56 pieces of candy after 2 weeks.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces of candy Amy eats in 2 weeks:

Number of pieces Amy eats in 2 weeks = Daily pieces eaten * Number of days in 2 weeks

Number of pieces Amy eats in 2 weeks = 3 * 14
Number of pieces Amy eats in 2 weeks = 42 pieces

Since Amy started with 100 pieces of candy and she's eaten 42 pieces, we can calculate how many pieces of candy she has left:

Pieces of candy Amy has after 2 weeks = Starting pieces - Pieces eaten
Pieces of candy Amy has after 2 weeks = 100 - 42

{The final answer is: Amy has 58 pieces of candy left after 2 weeks.}</s>","First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot of his bathroom.
2. The total area of Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 square feet.
3. To cover two thirds of the bathroom, we need to find the area of that portion and then determine how many tiles are needed for that area.
4. To find the area of two thirds of the bathroom, we multiply the total area by 2/3: 36 square feet × 2/3.
5. Simplifying the fraction, we get: 36 square feet × 0.66667.
6. Now, we calculate how many tiles are needed for this area: 0.66667 × 36 square feet × 24 mosaic tiles per square foot.
7. Multiplying these values, we get: 0.66667 × 36 × 24 = 251.69 square feet of tiles.
8. Since it's not possible to have a fraction of a tile, we'll round up to the nearest whole number to ensure Mr. Boarden has enough tiles.

The cost of going to the blueberry farm is $20. We don't have information about the cost per pound for picking at the farm. We'll assume the given price of $1.5/lb is only for the blueberries that James picks.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of blueberries picked
James picked 30 pounds of blueberries and it costs $1.5/lb. So, the cost of the blueberries he picked is:
Cost = Pounds picked * Price per pound
Cost = 30 * $1.5
Cost = $45

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying blueberries at the store
We're given that the cost of blueberries at the store is $2.5 a pound. To calculate the cost of buying a certain amount at the store, we just multiply the cost per pound at the store by the number of pounds. Let's call this number ""x"" and calculate the cost:
Cost at store = x * $2.5

Step 4: Compare the costs
To find out how much James saved, we need to compare the cost of the blueberries he picked and the cost of buying the same amount at the store:
Savings = (Cost of blueberries picked) - (Cost of buying blueberries at the store)
Savings = ($45) - (x * $2.5)

Since we don't know the exact number of pounds of blueberries James would have bought at the store if he hadn't gone picking, it's not possible to find the exact savings. Therefore, the question lacks enough information to find a definitive answer.

Total cost (planned) = 500 * $700
Total cost (planned) = $350,000

Step 2: When they went to order, they found out that each computer cost 10% more than they had planned. This means each computer now costs 110% of the original price. To find the new cost per computer, we multiply the original cost by 1.1:
New cost per computer = Original cost * 1.1
New cost per computer = $700 * 1.1
New cost per computer = $770

Step 3: So, to find the total cost at the new prices, we multiply the number of computers by the new cost per computer:

Since there are 6 eggs and each egg is 75 calories, the calories from eggs are:
Calories from eggs = 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

Step 2: Calculate the calories from cheese.
There is 2 oz of cheese. Therefore, the calories from cheese are:
Calories from cheese = 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

Step 3: Calculate the calories from ham.
There is an equal amount of ham to cheese. Since there is 2 oz of cheese, there must be 2 oz of ham. The calories from ham are:
Calories from ham = 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

                    A pencil cost $0.50, and an eraser cost $0.25. If you bought 6 pencils and 8 . erasers and paid ? $10, how much change would you get?
                 [/INST] First, let's calculate the total cost of buying 6 pencils and 8 erasers. We know that the cost of a pencil is $0.50 and the cost of an eraser is $0.25.

Next, we'll calculate the cost of buying 6 pencils by multiplying the number of pencils by the cost of each pencil: 6 pencils * $0.50/pencil = $3.00.

We'll do the same for erasers: 8 erasers * $0.25/eraser = $2.00.

Now, we'll add the costs of the pencils and erasers to find the total cost: $3.00 (pencils) + $2.00 (erasers) = $5.00.

The problem states that you paid $10 in total. Therefore, the change you would receive would be the difference between what you paid and what the cost of the pencils and erasers was: $10 (what you paid) - $5.00 (cost of pencils and erasers) = $5.00 (change).

So, the final answer is: {You would receive a change of $5.00}. Note that the change should actually be a refund, but since we're just calculating the difference, we call it change.</s>","6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.
8 erasers cost 8 x $0.25 = $<<8*0.25=2>>2.
Thus, you spent $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5.
Therefore, you would get $10 - $5 = $<<10-5=5>>5 change.

1. Each pizza had 12 slices.
2. Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, they had 12 slices * 2 (number of pizzas for Bryce and two friends) * (2/3) = 16 slices in total.
3. The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas. So, they had 12 slices * 2 (number of pizzas for the remaining friends) * (¾) = 10.5 * 2 = 21 slices in total.

Now, let's find the number of slices left over:
1. The total number of slices consumed was 16 slices for Bryce and two friends + 21 slices for the remaining friends = 37 slices.
2. There were initially (5 friends) * (12 slices/pizza) = 60 slices in total.
3. The difference between the total number of slices and the number of slices consumed is the number of slices left: 60 slices - 37 slices = 23 slices.

2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.

                 [/INST] First, let's find out how long it takes the cat to eat nine sausages. We know that the cat consumes nine sausages in 30 minutes.

Next, we'll determine how long it takes the dog to eat the same number of sausages. According to the problem, the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 of the time it takes the cat.

Let T be the time it takes the cat to eat nine sausages.

The dog eats the same number of sausages in T/3 minutes.

Since both the cat and the dog eat the same number of sausages, their eating rates are equal. Let's express their eating rates as quantities per minute.

cat's eating rate = sausages eaten / time in minutes
cat's eating rate = 9 / 30

To find the dog's eating rate, we know that it eats the same number of sausages in a shorter amount of time. We'll use the information given: the dog eats the same number of sausages in T/3 minutes.

dog's eating rate = sausages eaten / time in minutes
dog's eating rate = 9 / (T/3)

Since their eating rates are equal, we'll set the expressions above equal to each other and solve for T:

9 / 30 = 9 / (T/3)

Cross-multiplying gives:

3 * 9 = 30 * T
27 = 30T

Divide both sides by 30:

T = 27/3 = 9 minutes

Now that we have the time it takes the cat to eat nine sausages, we can calculate the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages.

cat's time = 9 minutes
dog's time = T/3 (where T = 9)
dog's time = 9/3 minutes

average time = (cat's time + dog's time) / 2
average time = (9 + 3) / 2
average time = 12 / 2
{The final answer is 6 minutes}.</s>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to 8 x 12 inches + 4 inches = 96 inches.

The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes: 9x + 10.

We are given that 9x + 10 = 96.

To find the value of x, let's first find the value of 9x.

9x = 96 - 10
    = 86

Now, we can find the value of x:

x = 86 / 9

To find the result in its simplest form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

x = 43 / 4.5

Since we are looking for the answer in inches, and since we cannot have a decimals/fractions for lengths, the problem is inconsistent as it seems that we cannot find the exact length of Bobby's shoe from Topher's shoe length information given in the problem.

Therefore, it is impossible to find a definite answer with the information given in the problem.

Final answer: The problem does not provide enough information to find the answer.</s>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

                    Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread, 45 ? dark blue spools of thread, 40 light green spools of thread, and 50 dark green spools of thread. What percent of her spools are blue?
                 [/INST] First, let's find the total number of spools Candy has:

Total spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools + Light green spools + Dark green spools

Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50

Total spools = 110

Next, let's find out how many spools are blue (light blue and dark blue):

Blue spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools

Blue spools = 15 + 45

Blue spools = 60

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools out of the total number of spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100:

Percentage of blue spools = (Blue spools / Total spools) * 100%

Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 110) * 100%

Percentage of blue spools = 0.5455 * 100%

Percentage of blue spools = 54.55%

Since we're looking for the percent as a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, {The final answer is: Approximately 54% of Candy's spools are blue.}</s>","First find the number of blue spools: 15 spools + 45 spools = <<15+45=60>>60 spools
Then find the total number of spools: 40 spools + 50 spools + 60 spools = <<40+50+60=150>>150 spools
Then divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 60 spools / 150 spools * 100% = 40%

Step 2: By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by midday is: 5000 * (2/5) = 2000

Step 3: By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted. So, the number of people who had voted by 16:00 is: x + 2000

Step 4: We know that 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. So, we can calculate the remainder by: x = (5000 - 2000) * (1/3)

Step 5: Simplifying the equation, we get: x = (5000/3 - 2000)

Step 6: Calculating the value of x: x = (16666.67 - 2000) = 13666.67

Step 7: Since the number of people cannot be a fraction, we need to find the closest integer value. So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is: x ≈ 13667

                 [/INST] To find out how many packs of gum Parker needs to buy to last him 30 days, we first need to determine how many pieces of gum he goes through in 30 days.

Given that Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, the number of pieces he goes through in one day is 4. The number of pieces he goes through in 30 days is:

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Since there are 15 pieces of gum in one pack, we can now calculate how many packs of gum Parker needs:

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

{The final answer is: Parker needs to buy 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.}</s>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum

                    question:
                    Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores.  There are 3 sleeves in a box.  If 9 kids want 2 smores apiece and 6 adults will eat 1 smore apiece, how many boxes of graham crackers will , they need?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many smores each box of graham crackers makes. Since each sleeve makes the base for 8 large smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box, we have:
Smores per box = Sleeves per box * Smores per sleeve
= 3 * 8
= 24

Step 2: Determine how many smores are needed for the kids. There are 9 kids, and each will have 2 smores, so:
Smores for kids = Kids * Smores per kid
= 9 * 2
= 18

Step 3: Determine how many smores are needed for the adults. There are 6 adults, and each will have 1 smore, so:
Smores for adults = Adults * Smores per adult
= 6 * 1
= 6

Step 4: Determine the total number of smores needed. We have:
Total smores = Smores for kids + Smores for adults
= 18 + 6
= 24

Step 5: Determine how many boxes of graham crackers are needed to make 24 smores. We have:
Boxes needed = Total smores / Smores per box
= 24 / 24
= 1

However, since a box can make more than 24 smores, it's likely that the children and adults can share a box. Let's check this by seeing how many additional smores can be made with one box:

Step 6: Determine extra smores from one box. We know that a box makes 24 smores, so we have:
Extrasmores = Total smores - Smores used
= 24 - 24
= 0

Since there are no extra smores, it seems that one box is not enough for the kids and adults. Let's calculate how many boxes would be needed if each person had exactly one smore.

Step 7: Calculate the number of boxes needed for everyone to have exactly one smore each. We know that:
Total smores = Smores for kids + Smores for adults
=> 24 = 18 + Smores for adults
=> Smores for adults = 6

We also know that:
Smores per box = Sleeves per box * Smores per sleeve
= 3 * 8
= 24

Therefore, if everyone had exactly one smore each, they would need:
=> Boxes needed = Total smores / Smores per box
= 24 / 24
= 1 box per person
=> Total boxes needed = People * Boxes per person
= 15 * 1
= 15

So, they would need 15 boxes of graham crackers in total to provide exactly one smore for each person. However, since it's more likely that the kids and adults will share a box, a more practical solution would be to buy a few extra boxes to ensure everyone has enough smores. A reasonable estimate might be buying 17 or 18 boxes to have enough for all the smores and some extras for each person.

Final answer: {They need around 17 or 18 boxes of graham crackers}.</s>","Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores
There are 9 kids who will eat 2 smores a piece so they will eat 9*2 = <<9*2=18>>18 smores
There are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores
Together the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores
Each box makes 24 smores and together the kids and adults will eat 24 s'mores so they will need 24/24 = <<24/24=1>>1 box of graham crackers

Step 3: To find the combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their individual ages: X + (X + 8) + [(X + 8) - 4].

Step 4: Simplifying the above expression, we get: 3X + 10.

Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.

1. Greg found $20.
2. He decided to split the money equally among his 3 younger siblings.

First, calculate the amount of money each sibling will get:

Amount per sibling = Total amount of money / Number of siblings
= $20 / 3 siblings

3. Simplify the fraction:
= $20 / 3 ≈ $6.67

However, we cannot give the siblings an amount of money that is not a whole number. Therefore, Greg and his siblings can agree to divide the $20 into three portions of $6.67 each, and round down to $6 for each sibling, or they can wait and find a way to make change for $6.67 for each sibling.

Final answer: Each of Greg's siblings got approximately $6. {However, with rounding down for a fair split, each received $6.}</s>","Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.

Let's calculate the number of votes for candidates A and B:

1. Candidate A received 20% of the votes, so they received:

1. Giant cubes: Peter makes 3 cubes with 4 ounces each. Therefore, he uses:
   Giant cubes ounces = Number of giant cubes × Water per cube
   = 3 cubes × 4 ounces
   = 12 ounces

2. Medium cubes: Peter makes 7 cubes with 2 ounces each. Therefore, he uses:
   Medium cubes ounces = Number of medium cubes × Water per cube
   = 7 cubes × 2 ounces
   = 14 ounces

3. Small cubes: Peter makes 8 cubes with 1/2 ounce each. Therefore, he uses:
   Small cubes ounces = Number of small cubes × Water per cube
   = 8 cubes × 1/2 ounce
   = 4 ounces

To calculate the total number of ounces Peter has used so far, we sum up the respective totals:

Total ounces used = Giant cubes ounces + Medium cubes ounces + Small cubes ounces
= 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces
= 28 ounces

Since Peter started with 32 ounces of water, to find out how many ounces are left, we subtract the total amount used from the initial amount:

Remaining water = Initial water - Total ounces used
= 32 ounces - 28 ounces
= 4 ounces

So, Peter has 4 ounces of water left.

{The final answer is: Peter has 4 ounces of water left.}</s>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.

$5 (for a gallon jar) - $2 (difference in cost) = $3

Now, we can calculate the cost of 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars:

Cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 * $5 = $50
Cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 * $3 = $52

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps:

1. We have a class of 50 students.
2. There are 10 students who like to bake.
3. There are 5 students who like to play basketball.
4. The number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.

Let's denote the number of students who like to play music as x. According to the problem, x = 2 * 5 = 10 * 2 = 20 students.

Now, the number of students who like to play video games is the remainder of the total number of students when the number of students with other hobbies is subtracted from the total number of students.

Let's denote the number of students with hobbies other than baking, basketball, or music as y. We know that there are 10 students who bake, 5 students who play basketball, and 35 students with other hobbies (since there are 50 students in total).

Using the information given, we can write the equation:

10 (baking) + 5 (basketball) + y (other hobbies) = 50 (total students)

Solving for y, we get:

y = 50 - (10 + 5) = 35

So, there are 35 students with other hobbies.

Since we know there are 20 students with the hobby of music, the number of students with the hobby of playing video games is:

50 (total students) - 10 (baking) - 5 (basketball) - 20 (music) = 15 students

{The final answer is 15 students who like to play video games.}</s>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

Let's find out how many students are in one class:
1. Since the total number of students is 80 and there are two classes with an equal number of students, each class must have 40 students (80 / 2).

Now we can find out how many boys are in one class:
1. We know that in each class there are 40% girls and 60% boys.
2. Therefore, the number of boys in one class is 60% of the total number of students in one class, which is 0.6 * 40 = 24 boys.

If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, how many animals will she groom each day of the week?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into parts:

1. First, let's calculate the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom per week. She has 8 dogs, which is 8 * 1 (since each dog gets bathed individually), 5 cats (5), 3 birds (3), and 12 horses (12). In total,she has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals.
2. Next, we want to find out how many animals she can groom evenly over the days in a week. A week has 7 days, so we divide the total number of animals by the number of days: 28 / 7 = <<28/7=4.028571428571429>>4.03 animals per day. Since she can't groom a fraction of an animal, she'll need to groom more than 4 animals per day.
3. To find the exact number of animals she can groom per day, we consider the largest number of animals she can groom from each type. From the problem statement we know that she can groom a dog, a cat, a bird, or a horse in one day. Therefore, she can groom 1 dog, 1 cat, or 1 bird per day, which is the smallest number. Since there are 8 dogs, she can groom all of them in 8 days. Similarly, she can groom all 5 cats in 5 days, and all 3 birds in 3 days. For the horses, since there are 12 and 7 days in a week, she can groom 12/7 ≈ 1.7 horses per day. But since she cannot groom a fraction of a horse, she will need to groom 2 horses per day to groom all 12 horses in 6 days.
4. From this information, we can find the maximum number of animals she can groom per day: maxAnimalsPerDay = max(1 (dog), 1 (cat), 1 (bird), 2 (horses)) = 2.

So, Melissa can groom a maximum of 2 animals per day.
{The final answer is: Melissa can groom 2 animals per day.}</s>","Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.

                 [/INST] To find out how much profit Mark made, we need to calculate the total cost of the packs and the total selling price of all the cards he obtained.

Step 1: Find the cost of 3 packs of old magic cards.
Cost of one pack = $1800
Cost of 3 packs = Cost of one pack * Number of packs
Cost of 3 packs = $1800 * 3 = $5400

Step 2: Find the selling price of the 2 high-value cards.
Price of first high-value card = $4000
Price of second high-value card = $1000
Total selling price of high-value cards = $4000 + $1000 = $5000

Step 3: Find the total selling price of the 30 remaining cards.
Average price of one card = $50
Total selling price of 30 cards = $50 * 30 = $1500

Step 4: Find the total profit.
Total profit = Total selling price - Total cost
Total profit = $5000 + $1500 - $5400 = -$2900

However, the final answer should be a profit amount, not a loss. In this scenario, there seems to be an error in the problem statement, since the cost of the packs ($5400) is more than the selling price of all the cards ($5000 + $1500). This contradiction results in an incorrect loss value. Additionally, the symbol '!' for the second high-value card is not defined, so it should be removed from the problem to make it solvable. To determine profit, the cost should be lower than the selling price.

Therefore, this question doesn't have a feasible answer. For further assistance, please ensure the problem statement is clear and the given values are valid. {The final answer is undefined}</s>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500
So all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500
The cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400

At the first amusement park:
- $26 for each adult * 2 adults = $52
- $12 for each child * 2 children = $24
- Total cost for the first park = $52 + $24 = $76

At the second amusement park:
- $14 for each adult * 2 adults = $28
- $10 for each child * 2 children = $20
- Total cost for the second park = $28 + $20 = $48

Now, we can calculate the difference in cost between the two parks:

Difference in cost = Cost of the first park - Cost of the second park = $76 - $48 = $28.

{The final answer is: $28. Jake's family can save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.}</s>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many tomatoes the vendor buys from each vendor in a day with the new prices.

Tomatoes bought from the old vendor = 500 tomatoes
Price per tomato from the old vendor = $0.5

Tomatoes bought from the new vendor = Unknown
Price per tomato from the new vendor = $0.4

To find out how many tomatoes the vendor buys from the new vendor, we can set up an equation:
500 = 2 * X, where X is the number of tomatoes bought from the new vendor.

X = 500 / 2
X = 250

So, the vendor buys 250 tomatoes from the new vendor.

Step 2: Find out how much the vendor spends on tomatoes from each vendor daily.

Money spent on tomatoes from the old vendor = 500 * $0.5
Money spent on tomatoes from the old vendor = $250

Money spent on tomatoes from the new vendor = 250 * $0.4
Money spent on tomatoes from the new vendor = $100

Step 3: Find out how much money the vendor saves daily.

Daily savings = Money spent on tomatoes from the old vendor - Money spent on tomatoes from the new vendor
Daily savings = $250 - $100
Daily savings = $150

Step 4: Find out how much money the vendor saves weekly.

Weekly savings = Daily savings * 7
Weekly savings = $150 * 7
Weekly savings = $1050

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of marbles that Cal has as C. According to the problem, Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so the number of marbles that Sean has is C/2. We're also told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so the number of marbles that Carl has is 4 * (C/2).

Now we want to find the total number of marbles that both Carl and Cal have. We have:

C (marbles Cal has) + 4 * (C/2) (marbles Carl has) = Total marbles

To find the total number of marbles, we can first find the value of Carl's marbles and then add it to Cal's marbles:

C + 4 * (C/2) = Total marbles

Now, we can solve for ""Total marbles"" by combining the terms:

C + 4 * (C/2) = Total marbles
C + 2C = Total marbles
3C = Total marbles

To find the value of ""C,"" we need to know the number of marbles that Sean has. We are told that Sean has 56 marbles, so:

C = 2 * Sean's marbles = 2 * 56 = 112

So, the number of marbles that Cal has is 112, and the number of marbles that Carl has is 4 * (Cal's marbles) = 4 * 112 = 448.

Therefore, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 112 (Cal's) + 448 (Carl's) = 550.

2. Calculate the number of students currently in the given number of groups and compare it to the required number of groups.

Step 1: Determining the number of students per group for six groups:
Since we want six groups, we need to divide the total number of students by 6.
Number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups
Number of students per group = 54 / 6
Number of students per group = 9

Step 2: Calculate the number of students currently in six groups and compare it to the required number of groups:
Number of students in six groups = Number of students per group * Number of groups
Number of students in six groups = 9 * 6
Number of students in six groups = 54

Since the current number of groups (6) is equal to the number of groups required for the students we have (6), we do not need any additional groups.

                 [/INST] To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we first need to determine how many chairs are rented during one weekday, one weekend day, and one whole week.

1. Chairs rented on one weekday: 60 chairs
2. Chairs rented on one weekend day: 100 chairs
3. Chairs rented during one week (5 weekdays + 2 weekend days): Chairs rented on weekdays = 5 * 60 = 300, Chairs rented on weekend days = 2 * 100 = 200, Total chairs rented during one week = 300 + 200 = 500

Now that we know Candy rents out 500 chairs during one week, we can calculate how many chairs are rented during one month since there are 4 weeks in a month.

4. Chairs rented during one month = 500 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 2000 chairs

Finally, to find out how many chairs will be rented out during two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one month by 2.

5. Chairs rented during two 4-week months = 2000 chairs/month * 2 months = 4000 chairs

Therefore, the final answer is {Candy will be able to rent out 4000 chairs in total during two 4-week months}.</s>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find out how many small and large buttons Lorraine gets by trading her small stickers. She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them:

30 small stickers * 90% = 27 small stickers for each large button
27 small stickers * 1 large button = 27 small buttons or 81 small buttons for each large button (since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons)

So, Lorraine gets 81 large buttons by trading her small stickers.

Step 2: Now let's find out how many large and small buttons Lorraine gets by trading her large stickers. She starts with 40 large stickers and trades 50% of them for large buttons and the rest for small buttons:

40 large stickers * 50% = 20 large stickers for large buttons
40 large stickers - 20 large stickers = 20 large stickers for small buttons

Step 3: Add the number of buttons that Lorraine got by trading her small stickers to the number of buttons she got by trading her large stickers:

Buttons from large stickers = 20 large buttons
Buttons from small stickers = 81 large buttons (which are equivalent to 243 small buttons)

So, the total number of buttons that Lorraine has is:

Total buttons = Buttons from small stickers + Buttons from large stickers
Total buttons = 243 small buttons + 20 large buttons

Converting large buttons to small buttons, we get:

Total buttons = 243 small buttons + (3 * 20) small buttons
Total buttons = 243 small buttons + 60 small buttons

{The final answer is: Lorraine has a total of 303 small buttons by the end.}</s>","She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of votes in favor of the new regulation as x. We know that there are 33 people on the council, and that the number of votes against the new regulation is half the number of votes in favor.

We can set up the equation:

x (votes in favor) = 2 * (votes against)

We also know that the total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and votes against:

x + (1/2 * x) = 33 * (total number of council members)

Combining the terms on the left side of the equation, we have:

x + x/2 = 33

To solve for x, we first need to get rid of the fraction. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:

2x + x = 2 * 33

Simplifying the right side, we get:

2x + x = 66

Now we need to combine like terms:

3x = 66

Finally, to find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 66 / 3

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is approximately 22.

{The final answer is 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.}</s>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So the number of students requiring size small is 2 * 11 = 22. {The number of small shirts Krissa ordered is 22}.
3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So the number of size medium shirts required is 22 - 4 = 18. {The number of medium shirts Krissa ordered is 18}.
4. Half as many students need size large as size medium. So the number of students requiring size large is 18 / 2 = 9. {The number of large shirts Krissa ordered is 9}.

                 [/INST] To find the amount paid after the discount, we first need to find the amount of the discount, and then subtract that from the original price.

Step 1: Determine the amount of the discount:
The discount is 5% of $140.
To find the discount amount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage.

 discount amount = original price * discount percentage

Step 1: Calculate 20% of 50.
20% * 50 = 0.2 * 50 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, let's find out how many people are left after those 10 people have made their prediction.

Step 1: We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let X be the total number of Jana's puppies.
X = 2/3 * (number of Pomeranians) + (number of non-Pomeranians)

Since we're only concerned with the number of Pomeranians, we can focus on the first part of the equation.

Step 2: We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of those are girls. So, one-third of the Pomeranians are girls. We have 6 Pomeranian girls.

Let Y be the number of Pomeranian girls.
Y = 1/3 * (number of Pomeranians)

We know that Y = 6, so:

Step 3: Solve for the number of Pomeranians.
Y = 1/3 * (number of Pomeranians)
6 = 1/3 * (number of Pomeranians)

Now we can find the number of Pomeranians:
3 * 6 = 18

So, there are 18 Pomeranians. Using this value in the first equation, we can find the total number of puppies:

X = 2/3 * 18 + (number of non-Pomeranians)
X = 12 + (number of non-Pomeranians)

Since we don't know the number of non-Pomeranians, we can't find the exact total number of puppies Jana has.

                 [/INST] Let's work through this step by step:

1. We know that the three houses will require a total of 250 cases of shingles.
2. The second house needs 1/2 the amount of shingles as the first house, so the first house uses x cases of shingles. Therefore, the second house uses x * 1/2 = 0.5x cases of shingles.
3. The third house needs double the amount of shingles as the first house, so it needs 2x cases of shingles.
4. We know that the total number of cases of shingles is 250, so we can set up the equation: 0.5x + x + 2x = 250.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that in one hour, Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed. And Ezra reads 300 books in an hour. So, Ahmed reads half of that, which is 300 books / 2 = <150 books> {Note: There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement since 300 books / 2 is an impossible number for Ahmed to read in an hour according to the given information}. We can't continue with this calculation, let's find out how many books Ahmed reads in an hour, to have a correct comparison.

Step 2: To find out how many books Ahmed reads in an hour, let's assume he reads x number of books. Then, Ezra reads 2x books in the same hour. We know that 2x = 300, so x = 150. Therefore, Ahmed reads 150 books in an hour.

Step 3: Ezra initially reads 300 books in an hour, and then he reads an additional 150 books. The total number of books Ezra reads in this hour is 300 + 150 = 450 books.

Step 4: To find the total number of books they both read in this hour, we add the number of books they read individually. But, as mentioned earlier, the problem seems to have a mistake (300 books / 2 = impossible number for Ahmed). With the given information, Ezra reads 450 books in an hour, so Ahmed reads 150 books in an hour, and their total is 450 + 150 = 600 books.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the amount of money Bennet made from selling eggplants.
Money from eggplants = Number of eggplants sold * Price per eggplants
Money from eggplants = 20 * $3
Money from eggplants = $60

Step 2: Determine the amount of money Bennet wants to make in total.
Total amount = $135

Step 3: Find out how many ears of corn Bennet plans to sell.
Number of ears of corn = _____

Since we don't know the number of ears of corn, we cannot directly calculate their price. To find that out, we need to use the given information more effectively. We can set up an equation to represent the desired total income and the known incomes from selling eggplants and the planned number of ears of corn.

Step 4: Set up the equation:
$135 = $60 + (Number of ears of corn * Price per ear of corn)

We need to find the price per ear of corn, which is the unknown variable. However, without knowing the number of ears of corn, we cannot directly find the price. To proceed, let's assume a reasonable number for the number of ears of corn, and see if it satisfies the equation. For example, let's try 30 ears.

Step 5: Test the assumed value of ears of corn (30):
$135 = $60 + (30 * Price per ear of corn)

To solve the equation, we should isolate the price per ear of corn:
Price per ear of corn = ($135 - $60) / 30

Price per ear of corn ≈ $3.83

Since this price doesn't seem reasonable for corn, let's try another number for the quantity of ears of corn, like 40.

Step 6: Test the assumed new value of ears of corn (40):
$135 = $60 + (40 * Price per ear of corn)

Price per ear of corn = ($135 - $60) / 40

Price per ear of corn ≈ $3.18

Now, the price seems closer to what is typically charged for an ear of corn. However, we should check if this value works using a more precise number for the number of ears of corn.

Step 7: Test a more precise value for the quantity of ears of corn to ensure accuracy. Let’s try finding the price per ear with 35 ears.

$135 = $60 + (35 * Price per ear of corn)

Solving the equation:
Price per ear of corn = ($135 - $60) / 35 ≈ $3.89

Thus, the price per ear of corn that enables Bennet to make a total of $135 from selling 20 eggplants and x ears of corn is approximately $3.89.

{The final answer is $3.89 per ear of corn.}</s>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn

1. Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. So her weekend contains 12 hours of time.
2. She spends 3 hours reading, so she has 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours left for soccer and video games.
3. She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time. So she spends 9 hours * 1/3 = 3 hours playing video games.
4. Therefore, she has 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left for playing soccer.
5. In total, Tatiana spends 3 hours reading, 3 hours playing video games, and 6 hours playing soccer over the weekend.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon.
Anthony gave 1/2 of his pencils to Brandon. So, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:
50 pencils * 1/2 = 25 pencils

Step 2: Find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie.
Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. Before giving pencils to Charlie, Anthony had 50 pencils. After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony had:
50 pencils - 25 pencils = 25 pencils
Now, Anthony gave Charlie 3/5 of the remaining pencils. Let's find out how many pencils were given to Charlie:
25 pencils * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Step 3: Find out how many pencils Anthony kept.
The number of pencils Anthony kept is the number of pencils he had after giving pencils to Brandon and Charlie. Therefore, the number of pencels Anthony kept is:
25 pencils - 25 pencils (given to Brandon) - 15 pencils (given to Charlie) = 0 pencils

However, the question states that Anthony kept some positive number of pencils. There seems to be a mistake in the problem.

If we assume that the mistake is in the number of pencils Anthony started with, instead of 50 pencils, let's try with a valid number.

Let's assume Anthony had 55 pencils at the beginning.

Step 1: Find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon.
55 pencils * 1/2 = 27.5 pencils. Since the number of pencils must be a whole number, let's round it off to 28 pencils.

Step 2: Find out how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie.
25 pencils * 3/5 = 15 pencils

Step 3: Find out how many pencils Anthony kept.
25 pencils (remaining after giving pencils to Brandon) - 15 pencils (given to Charlie) = 10 pencils.

So, under the assumption that Anthony had 55 pencils at the beginning, he kept 10 pencils.

{The final answer is 10 pencils.}</s>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils
So, there were 50 -25 = <<50-25=25>>25 pencils left.

Thus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.
Therefore, Anthony kept 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 pencils.

Henry has 57 cars, and each car requires 4 wheels. So, the number of wheels needed for cars is: 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of wheels needed for motorcycles.
Henry has 73 motorcycles, and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. So, the number of wheels needed for motorcycles is: 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 motorcycles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for all toys.
Total number of wheels = wheels for cars + wheels for motorcycles = 228 cars * 4 wheels/car + 146 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle
Total number of wheels = 912 + 292 = 1204

                    The Llesis family drove and hiked ! 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average : of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of ; 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the time spent driving and hiking.
The total time they spent was 6 hours. Let's denote the time spent driving as t_d and the time spent hiking as t_h. We know that:

t_d + t_h = 6 hours

Step 2: Find the distance driven and the distance hiked.
The average driving speed was 50 miles per hour, and the hiking speed was 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed. Let's find the hiking speed first:

Hiking speed = Half of driving speed - 5 miles per hour = 25 miles per hour

Now let's find the distance:
1. Distance traveled driving = Speed * Time
distance_d = 50 miles/hour * t_d

2. Distance hiked = Speed * Time
distance_h = 25 miles/hour * 1.5 hours

Step 3: Find the total distance.
The total distance is the sum of the distance traveled driving and the distance hiked:

Total distance = distance_d + distance_h

Replace the variables back into the equation:

Total distance = 50 miles/hour * t_d + 25 miles/hour * 1.5 hours

Step 4: Solve for the total distance.
We don't know the exact values of t_d, but we do know that:
1. t_d + t_h = 6 hours
2. t_h = 1.5 hours.

Substitute the given values into the equation:

Total distance = 50 miles/hour * t_d + 25 miles/hour * 1.5 hours

Since t_h is already given, we can find t_d by subtracting t_h from the total time:

t_d = 6 hours - 1.5 hours = 4.5 hours

Now calculate the total distance:

Total distance = 50 miles/hour * 4.5 hours + 25 miles/hour * 1.5 hours

The final answer is: Total distance = 105 miles + 37.5 miles = 142.5 miles.</s>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                 [/INST] To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate each of their scores based on the given information and then subtract Ava's score from Emma's score.

Let's first calculate Ava's score:
1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: 8 enemies * 10 points/enemy = 80 points
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: 3 berries * 5 points/berry = 15 points
3. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has 4 seconds less time: 4 seconds * 30 points/second = 120 points

Now let's calculate Ava's total score:
Ava's total score = 80 points (enemies) + 15 points (berries) - 120 points (time)
Ava's total score = 80 + 15 - 120
Ava's total score = 65

Next, let's calculate Emma's score based on the given information:
Since we don't have information on the number of enemies Emma defeated or the number of berries she collected, we can't directly calculate her score. However, we can find the difference between their scores once we have that information.

{The difference between their scores is Ava's score minus Emma's score = 65 points (Ava's score) - Emma's score}

Therefore, we need more information to determine Emma's score and the exact difference between their scores.</s>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

                 [/INST] Let's define some variables to make the problem more manageable:

1. Let x be the number of white fish in Bob's pond initially.
2. Let y be the number of orange fish in Bob's pond initially.
3. Let z be the number of white fish Bob bought at the store.
4. Let w be the number of orange fish in Bob's pond after purchasing new fish.

We know that Bob had 7 fish initially, 3 of which were orange, so:

y = 3
x = 4

Bob's pond had x white fish and y orange fish, so in total, there were x + y = 7 fish in the pond.

Now let's set up an equation to represent the situation after Bob bought more fish:

white fish: x + z = 2(x + y) => x + z = 2(x + y)
orange fish: y + w = 2(x + y)

Solving for z in the first equation:
1. Subtract x from both sides: z = 2x + 2y - x
2. Simplify: z = x + y

However, we know that Bob wanted to have twice as many orange fish as white fish, so:

y = 2x

Substitute y into the equation for z:

z = x + (2x) = 3x

Now, we can set up one equation with the available information. From the problem statement, we know that ""He now had twice as many orange fish as white fish,"" or x = 2y.

Let's try to find the connection between x, y, and z:
If x = 2y, then y = x/2
Substitute x/2 for y in the z equation: z = 3(x/2)

Simplify: z = 3x/2 => z = 2x/2 => z = x

Since our initial assumption that z = x + y was incorrect, we can't find a clear solution, as the initial problem implies an incorrect assumption.

The problem statement contains conflicting information: the statement that ""he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish"" is incompatible with the initial information that there were three orange fish and four white fish. To find an answer, we would need to clarify this inconsistency in the problem statement. {No definitive answer can be provided as given}.</s>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.

3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.

                    question:
                    Samwell owns an appliances store. For this week, one-fourth of their sales are ? smart TVs, one-eighth are analog TVs, and the rest are OLED , TVs. If they were able to sell a total of 40 TVs, how many OLED TVs were they able to sell?
                 [/INST] To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell was able to sell, we first need to determine how many smart TVs and analog TVs they sold.

1. One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs:
   Number of smart TVs = Total sales / 4

2. One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs:
   Number of analog TVs = Total sales / 8

3. The rest of the sales are OLED TVs. Since we know the number of smart TVs and analog TVs, we can find the number of OLED TVs by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:

   Number of OLED TVs = Total sales - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)

Given that they sold a total of 40 TVs:

1. Number of smart TVs = 40 / 4 = 10
2. Number of analog TVs = 40 / 8 = 5
3. Number of OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5) = 25

{The final answer is: they sold 25 OLED TVs.}</s>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.
He was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.
So, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.
Therefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.

                 [/INST] To find out how much money John is missing to cover the entire cost of the school trip, we first need to determine how much money he has already raised and how much the school is contributing.

1. John has raised $50.
2. The school is contributing half the cost of the trip.
3. The cost of the school trip is $300.

To find the amount of money the school is contributing, we need to find half the cost of the trip, which is:

Half the cost of the trip = $300 / 2 = $150

Now we know that John has raised $50 and the school is contributing $150. So, the total amount of money that has been raised for the trip is:

Total amount raised = $50 (John) + $150 (School) = $200

Next, we find the difference between the total cost of the trip and the amount of money that has been raised to see how much money John is still missing:

Total cost of the trip = $300
Amount of money raised = $200

Difference = Total cost of the trip - Amount of money raised
          = $300 - $200 = $100

Therefore, {The final answer is: John is missing $100 to cover the entire cost of the school trip.}</s>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.

                 [/INST] To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the house above freezing during the night, we need to determine how many degrees below freezing it is during the night, and then calculate how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by that amount.

Given:
1. The house is 45 degrees during the day.
2. It's 33 degrees, colder during the night compared to the day.

First, we'll find out how many degrees the temperature drops during the night:

Difference in temperature = Temperature during the day - Temperature during the night
Difference in temperature = 45 degrees - 33 degrees
Difference in temperature = 12 degrees

Now we need to find out how many logs it takes to heat up the house by 12 degrees:

Logs required = Temperature change / Temperature change per log
Logs required = 12 degrees / 5 degrees per log
Logs required = 2.4 logs

Since Carson can't burn a fraction of a log, he'll need to burn at least 3 logs to ensure the house temperature stays above freezing during the night.

{The final answer is: Carson needs to burn at least 3 logs}.</s>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

                    At the trip to the county-level scavenger hunt competition, 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition to begin. To break people up into smaller groups with different leaders, 9-person groups were formed. : If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each, how many seashells did they bring?
                 [/INST] To find the number of seashells brought back by all the groups, we first need to determine the number of groups and then multiply that by the number of seashells each group brings back.

Step 1: Find the number of groups formed.
90 people were required to be divided into 9-person groups. We can calculate the number of full groups, which will be equal to the number of people divided by the group size:

Number of full groups = Total number of people / Number of people per group
Number of full groups = 90 / 9
Number of full groups = 10

Since we cannot have only 10 groups with 9 people each, there will be an additional group with less members. Thus, we need to find the number of people in this last group:

People in the last group = Total number of people % Number of people per group
People in the last group = 90 % 9
People in the last group = 1

Thus, there are a total of 11 groups with a combined total of 99 people (10 full groups * 9 + 1 small group).

Step 2: Find the number of seashells per group.
Each group brought back 2 seashells per group member. Since there are 9 members in a full group, the number of seashells a full group brought back is:

Seashells per full group = Members in a full group * Seashells per member
Seashells per full group = 9 * 2
Seashells per full group = 18

Step 3: Find the total number of seashells.
To determine the total number of seashells brought back, we need to find the number of seashells in a full group and multiply that by the number of full groups and the last group:

Total seashells = Seashells per full group * Number of full groups + Seashells per small group
Total seashells = 18 * 10 + 2
Total seashells = 180 + 2
Total seashells = 182

{The final answer is: 182 seashells were brought back by all the groups}</s>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.
If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

Step 2: At the first stop, 47 people get off the train, so the number of people on the train decreases by 47.

People on train after first stop = Initial number of people - Number of people who got off
People on train after first stop = 172 - 47
People on train after first stop = 125

Step 3: Then, 13 more people get on the train at the first stop, so the number of people on the train increases by 13.

People on train after first stop and after people got on = People on train after first stop + Number of people who got on
People on train after first stop and after people got on = 125 + 13
People on train after first stop and after people got on = 138

The difference in their weekly salaries is: $230 (Billy) - $210 (Sally) = $20.

However, since the question asks for the difference in their earnings in dollars, not in cents, we need to add a dollar sign to the final answer:

{The final answer is: $20}

So, Billy earns $20 more than Sally in one week. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, Billy would earn $20 * 52 = $1,040 more than Sally in a year. But, since the question asks for the difference between their earnings in dollars for one week, not for a year, and we want to keep our answers consistent, we'll stick to $20 as our final answer.</s>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

First, let's find out how many trees each student will plant:
1 tree per student

Next, let's find out how many trees each teacher will plant:
2 trees per teacher

Now, let's find out how many students are in the entire school:
40 classes * 25 students per class = 1000 students

Since each student plants one tree, we know that 1000 trees will be planted by the students.

Next, let's find out how many teachers there are in total:
40 classes * 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Since each teacher plants two trees, we know that 120 teachers will plant a total of:
120 teachers * 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Therefore, the total number of trees planted during the campaign is:
1000 trees (planted by students) + 240 trees (planted by teachers) = {1240 trees}

1. Find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles has.
   Total stuffed animals = 3 (puppies) + 5 (koalas) + 2 (zebras) + 4 (frogs) = 14

2. Calculate how many stuffed goats are required to make up 30% of her total collection.
   30% of total stuffed animals = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2 ≈ 5 (since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed animal)

                 [/INST] To find out how many hours Kris needs to play in total to earn the achievement, let's first calculate the number of hours she plays during her 2-week period of half-hour sessions and her 1-week period of 2-hour sessions.

First, calculate the number of hours Kris plays during her 2-week period of half-hour sessions:
- Half an hour is equivalent to 0.5 hours, so she plays 0.5 hours per day.
- 2 weeks is equivalent to 14 days, so the total number of hours she plays during this period is: 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Next, calculate the number of hours Kris plays during her 1-week period of 2-hour sessions:
- Each day, she plays for 2 hours, so the total number of hours she plays during this week is: 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Kris has played so far:
- During her 2-week period, she played for 7 hours.
- During her 1-week period, she played for 14 hours.
- So, Kris has played for a total of 7 hours + 14 hours = 21 hours.

Finally, we need to find out how many hours more Kris needs to play to reach a total of 30 hours:
- She has played for 21 hours already, so she needs to play for: 30 hours - 21 hours = 9 hours.

{The final answer is: Kris needs to play for 9 more hours to earn the achievement.}</s>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.

First, let's find the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours:

The first car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour:
Distance1 = Speed1 * Time
Distance1 = 60 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance1 = 120 miles

The second car travels at a speed of 70 miles per hour:
Distance2 = Speed2 * Time
Distance2 = 70 miles/hour * 2 hours
Distance2 = 140 miles

Now, we can find the difference in their distances after 2 hours:

Difference = Distance2 - Distance1
Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles
Difference = 20 miles

{The final answer is: The two cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.}</s>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.

2. Number of passing fourth-graders: 40 out of 100, or 40% of fourth-graders passed.

3. Since the pass rate for fifth graders was twice that of fourth graders, the pass rate for fifth-graders was 40% * 2 = 80%.

4. To find the number of passing fifth-graders, we multiply the number of fifth-graders by the pass rate (500 * 0.8 = 400).

5. Now, let's find the total number of passing students: 340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 780.

                 [/INST] Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many glass chips Milo gets from two bags. Since each bag contains 72 chips, two bags would contain: 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

2. Next, we calculate the area of Milo's mosaic in square inches that the first two bags of chips can cover. Given that one square inch requires twelve glass chips, we have: 144 chips / 12 chips/inch² = 12 inches²

3. Milo's mosaic is three inches tall, so to find its length in inches, we need to determine how many inches of area are required to cover the same amount of surface area as the 12 square inches covered by the first two bags of chips. This is done by using the given ratio of three inches height to the calculation of the unknown length:

   - We know that 1 inch³ = 1 square inch, so the volume of Milo's mosaic is 3 inches * (length in inches) = 3 inches * (x inches) = 3x inches³.
   - Since 1 inch³ = 12 square inches, we can set up the equation as follows: 3x = 12.

4. Solving for x: x = 12 / 3 = 4 inches. {The final answer is: Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long.}</s>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

1. Quarts consumed by students who drank 1.5 quarts:
   Num of students = 4, Quarts per student = 1.5
   Total quarts consumed = Num_of_students * Quarts_per_student
   Total quarts consumed = 4 * 1.5 = 6 quarts

2. Quarts consumed by students who drank 2 quarts:
   Num of students = 16, Quarts per student = 2
   Total quarts consumed = Num_of_students * Quarts_per_student
   Total quarts consumed = 16 * 2 = 32 quarts

3. Calculate the total quarts consumed:
   Total quarts consumed = Quarts_consumed_by_1.5_quarts_students + Quarts_consumed_by_2_quarts_students
   Total quarts consumed = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts

4. Calculate the number of gallons in the original amount of tea:
   Gallons = Total_quarts / Quarts_per_gallon
   Gallons = 10 / 4
   Gallons = 2.5 (This doesn't make sense since there cannot be a fraction of a gallon)

Instead, let's first determine the number of quarts at the original party:

If , there are 10 students on campus at the beginning . of the year, how many additional students would have joined by , the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at ; the beginning of the year?
                 [/INST] To find out how many additional students join the campus by the end of May, we need to find out how many students are on campus at the end of May and then subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year.

We know that the number of students doubles every month. Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

1. At the end of the first month, there are 10 students * 2 = 20 students.
2. At the end of the second month, there are 20 students * 2 = 40 students.
3. At the end of the third month, there are 40 students * 2 = 80 students.
4. And so on...

We want to find out how many students are on campus at the end of May. May has 5 months after January, so we need to find 5 doublings of the initial number of students (10).

1. At the end of the 1st additional month, there are 10 students * 2 = 20 students.
2. At the end of the 2nd additional month, there are 20 students * 2 = 40 students.
3. At the end of the 3rd additional month, there are 40 students * 2 = 80 students.
4. At the end of the 4th additional month, there are 80 students * 2 = 160 students.
5. At the end of the 5th additional month (May), there are 160 students * 2 = 320 students.

{The final answer is 320 additional students}.</s>","At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20
At the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40
By the end of March, the number of students doubles to 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80
By the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160
At the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320
If there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.

1. Find the total number of branches Felix climbed in a week:
Total branches = Total earnings / Price per branch
Total branches = $105 / $0.25/branch
Total branches = 420

2. Find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day:
Average branches per day = Total branches / Number of days in a week
Average branches per day = 420 / 7
Average branches per day ≈ 60

Therefore, the final answer is: On average, Felix climbed approximately 60 branches per day.</s>","He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420

                 [/INST] To find out how many petals are in the vase, we first need to determine how many petals each type of flower contributes before accounting for the flowers that were dropped.

1. Three flowers with 5 petals each: 3 * 5 = 15 petals.
2. Four flowers with 6 petals each: 4 * 6 = 24 petals.
3. Five flowers with 4 petals each: 5 * 4 = 20 petals.
4. Six flowers with 7 petals each: 6 * 7 = 42 petals.

The total number of petals in the vase before accounting for the flowers that were dropped is:

15 (from the first set) + 24 (from the second set) + 20 (from the third set) + 42 (from the fourth set) = 101 petals

Now, let's account for the petals lost due to the dropped flowers:
1. One flower with 5 petals: 1 * 5 = 5 petals.
2. One flower with 6 petals: 1 * 6 = 6 petals.
3. One flower with 4 petals: 1 * 4 = 4 petals.
4. One flower with 7 petals: 1 * 7 = 7 petals.

The total number of petals lost is: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 18 petals.

The total number of petals in the vase after accounting for the petals lost due to dropped flowers is:

101 (total petals before dropping) - 18 (petals from dropped flowers) = 83 petals.

So the final answer is: {The final answer is 83 petals are in the vase}.</s>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that John and DeSean used a total of 18 marshmallows to make their initial 18 S'mores (9 each). So, we have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left in the bag.

Step 2: Given that there are 17 marshmallows left in the bag, we want to determine how many S'mores each kid can make with these remaining marshmallows. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, we can calculate the number of S'mores each kid can make by dividing the remaining number of marshmallows by the number of S'mores each kid makes.

Step 3: For John, he can make 17 / 9 = ≈ 1.89 ≈ 2 S'mores. Since he can't make a fraction of a S'more, John can make 2 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows.

Step 4: Similarly, for DeSean, he can make 17 / 9 = ≈ 1.89 ≈ 2 S'mores. Therefore, DeSean can also make 2 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows in the bag.

The final answer is: Each kid can make 2 S'mores with the remaining marshmallows in the bag.</s>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

How much money is used?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of games Jack plays in one hour as x. Since he can play one game in 20 minutes, we have:

1 hour = 2 * 20 minutes = 40 minutes
x games in 1 hour

Each game costs 1 quarter. So, the total number of quarters Jack uses in one hour is:

Quarters used by Jack in 1 hour = x

Since two of his friends can play half as long as him, they each play:

Quarters used by each friend in 1 hour = x / 2

Since there are two friends who are significantly worse than Jack, they use a combined total of:

Quarters used by the two friends in 1 hour = 2 * (x / 2) = x

Now, there is one friend who is significantly better than Jack and can play for 1.5 times as long:

Quarters used by the better friend in 1 hour = x * 1.5

They play for a total of 4 hours. To find the total number of quarters used, we can sum up the quarters used by Jack, the two worse friends, and the better friend:

Total quarters used in 4 hours = Quarters used by Jack in 4 hours + Quarters used by two friends in 4 hours + Quarters used by the better friend in 4 hours

We know that Jack plays x games in 1 hour, so he plays 4x games in 4 hours. Similarly, each of the two friends plays x / 2 games in 1 hour, so they play 2 * (x / 2) = x games in 4 hours. The better friend plays x * 1.5 games in 1 hour, so he plays 4 * (x * 1.5) = 6x games in 4 hours.

Therefore,

Total quarters used in 4 hours = 4x + x + 6x = 11x

However, the question doesn't provide enough information to find the exact value of x. So, we cannot determine the exact amount of money used without more information.

Therefore, there isn't a final answer for this problem, as it depends on the value of x.</s>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

She uses the same amount of ; citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She ; uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much , salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?
                 [/INST] To find the amount of oil that Tanya uses, we need to use the given information and solve the equations step by step.

Let x be the number of ounces of salt, y be the number of ounces of sugar, z be the number of ounces of citrus zest, and w be the number of ounces of oil.

Given that Tanya makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar, so x + y + z + w = 10

Also given that she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar, so z = y and x = 2w (since she uses twice as much salt as zest)

Now we have a system of equations:

x + y + z + w = 10
y = z
x = 2w

Substituting y = z we get:
x + z + z + w = 10
2w = x = 2z

From x = 2w and w = z, we know that w = z/2

Now we can find w in terms of z:

x = 2w = 2(z/2) = z

Substituting x = z in the first equation we get:
z + z + z + w = 10
3z + w = 10
w = 10 - 3z

Now we want to find the amount of oil w, and since we know that w = 10 - 3z, but it's not given any value for z, we cannot determine the exact value of w.

However, we can find the relationship between z and w, which is w = 10 - 3z.

Therefore, without knowing the amount of citrus zest (z) used, we cannot find the amount of oil (w) used.

The final answer is: We cannot determine the amount of oil used without knowing the amount of citrus zest used.</s>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the number of cars Robert has as R, and the number of cars Joe has as J. We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so J = 2R.

Step 2: Joe sells 20% of his cars. The number of cars he sells is 0.2 * J.

Step 3: Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sells to his mother. The number of cars he gives away is 2 * (0.2 * J).

Step 4: After selling and giving some to his mother, Joe is left with the number of cars remaining, which is J - (0.2 * J) - 2 * (0.2 * J).

Step 1: Determine the amount raised by organizations:
Given that the total amount raised is $175,000 and $50,000 was raised by organizations, we can find the amount raised by students by subtracting the amount raised by organizations from the total amount raised:

Amount raised by students = Total amount raised - Amount raised by organizations
Amount raised by students = $175,000 - $50,000
Amount raised by students = $125,000

Step 2: Determine the amount raised by each student:
Since there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount, we can divide the total amount raised by students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:

Amount raised by each student = Total amount raised by students / Number of students

Step 1: Find the hours Sandy walked on the second day.
We know that she walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. So,
Hours on the second day = Hours on the first day / 2

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours in each day.
On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours, so the number of hours in each day is:

Step 2: Cars added during first break: He counted an additional 20 cars during the first break, so the total number of cars present at that time was: 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

Step 3: Cars leaving during second break: At the lunch break, he recognized that 1/2 of the cars had left the lot. This means that 1/2 of the 70 cars were no longer in the parking lot, leaving 70 * 0.5 = 35 cars.

Step 4: Total cars counted during lunch break: Since there were 35 cars in the parking lot during the lunch break, this was the total number of cars Hunter counted during this time.

1. John does 30 cycles of work per day.
2. Each cycle contains 5 different tasks.
3. Each task pays $1.20.

First, let's find out how much John earns in one cycle:
5 tasks/cycle * $1.20/task = $6/cycle

Then, let's find out how much John earns in one day:
$6/cycle * 30 cycles/day = $180/day

Now, let's find out how much John earns in one week. We know there are 7 days in a week, so:
$180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

How many total ! points did Sasha score during both games?
                 [/INST] Step 1: In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points and Julie scored 10 points (since she scored 4 fewer points than Sasha).
Step 2: In the second game, Julie scored more points than Sasha. Let's call the number of points Julie scored in the second game ""X"". Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie, which means Sasha scored X - 6 points in the second game.
Step 3: Since this was an away game for Sasha, we don't have information about the usual point differential between the teams in their games. For the sake of calculation let's assume that ordinarily Julie scores Y points more than Sasha in her home games. In this game, Julie scored X points, so we have X = Y + 14 (since she scored Y more points than Sasha in her home game and Sasha scored 14 points).
Step 4: In the second game, Sasha scored X - 6 points, so we have X - 6 = Y - 14 (since Sasha scored X - 6 fewer points than Julie in this game and Julie scored Y fewer points than Sasha in her home game).
Step 5: Solving both equations for X we get X = Y + 14 and X = Y - 10. Setting the two equations equal to each other we have Y + 14 = Y - 10, which leads to the conclusion that Y = 24. So, in the first game, Julie scored 24 - 14 = 10 points. With this information, we can find the number of points Sasha scored in the second game. Substituting Y = 24 in X = Y + 14 we get X = 38, which means Sasha scored 38 - 6 = 32 points in the second game.

The final answer is that Sasha scored a total of 14 + 32 = 46 points during both games.</s>","In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.

Step 2: Calculate the number of tins for dog food.
Since each package of dog food contained 6 tins, and Kimberly bought 6 packages:
Number of tins for dog food = Packages of dog food * Tins per package
= 6 * 6
= 36 tins

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of tins for cat food and dog food.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as `x`.
According to the problem, Smendrick has `3 * x` cards, and Becca has `12 + x` cards.
The total number of cards is given as `341`, so we can write an equation:

x + 3x + (12 + x) = 341

To solve for `x`, we first combine like terms:

4x + 12

Subtracting `12` from both sides:

4x = -10

Now, to find the value of `x`, we divide both sides by `4`:

x = -10 / 4

x = -2.5

Since a number of cards cannot be a negative number, there is an error in the problem statement. However, assuming that Becca's number was meant to be 12 fewer than Smendrick, the equation should be:

x + 3x + (12 - x) = 341
2x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:
2x = 339

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 169.5

Again, a number of cards cannot be a decimal number. Let's check the problem statement one more time to make sure there are no mistakes, and if necessary, look for another approach.

It appears that the problem statement contains an error. We cannot find an integer number of cards for Becca, Smendrick, and PJ that meet the given conditions. The problem statement might need to be rephrased or checked for accuracy.

Next, let's find the number of blue eggs: Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 2 * 5 = 10 blue eggs.

Now, let's find the number of pink eggs: There was one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Lastly, let's find the number of yellow eggs: There was one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had (1/3) * 9 = 3 yellow eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs to find the total: 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 21 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 21 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 43 eggs

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the shipping cost first and then subtract the refund amount.

1. Calculate the shipping cost based on weight and distance:
   Weight: 4 pounds
   Distance: 20 miles
   Cost per pound: $0.35
   Cost per mile: $0.08

   Shipping cost = (Weight * Cost per pound) + (Distance * Cost per mile)
               = (4 * $0.35) + (20 * $0.08)
               = $1.40 + $1.60
               = $3.00

2. Determine the refund amount based on 75% of the book's purchase price:
   Book cost: $32

   Refund amount = 75% of the book's purchase price
               = 0.75 * $32
               = $24.32

3. Find the total amount Milly will lose:
   Total loss = Shipping cost + (Book cost - Refund amount)
            = $3.00 + ($32 - $24.32)
            = $3.00 + $7.68

1. Mulan starts with $40.
2. Her father gives her an additional $100. So, Mulan now has $40 + $100 = $140.
3. Mulan buys two pairs of jeans, each costing $30. So, she spends $30 x 2 = $60 on jeans.
4. Mulan also buys a bag for $20.
5. To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her father gave her: $140 - ($60 for jeans + $20 for a bag).

So, {The final answer is $60.} This indicates that Mulan has $60 left after buying the jeans and the bag.</s>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.

1. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
2. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.
3. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so he produces 8,000 bars / 2 = 4,000 bars.
4. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces 50,000 bars (for the entire month) × 1/3 = 16,667 bars. (rounded down to 16,666 since we can't produce a fraction of a bar)
5. To find how much Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the number of bars he produced in the first three weeks from the monthly production.
   - First three weeks: 8,000 bars + 4,000 bars + 16,666 bars = 28,666 bars
   - Monthly production: 50,000 bars
   - Difference: 50,000 bars - 28,666 bars = 21,334 bars

Hence, Boris produces 21,334 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

                 [/INST] Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Eva has saved $20.00. Let's name the amount Anthony has saved as ""A"" and the amount Roy has saved as ""R"". According to the problem, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, so R = A + 0.4A = 1.4A.

2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. Therefore, A = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.

3. Now we know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, so R = 1.4A = 1.4($30.00) = $42.00.

{The final answer is Roy has saved $42.00.}</s>","Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kaguyami. Let's call the height Kaguyami can lift as H_K. Then, Naruto can lift a mountain 10H_K units high.
2. Kaguyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. This means Saskay can lift a mountain H_K/4 units high.
3. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Pompei can lift a mountain H_S = H_K/12 units high.
4. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, which is equivalent to 1 foot or 12 inches. Thus, H_P = 1 foot = 12 inches = 12 units.
5. To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to find the height Naruto can lift in terms of the given unit (inch). We know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kaguyami, and Kaguyami can lift a height equivalent to 1 inch. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 12 = 120 times higher than Pompei. So, the height Naruto can lift is 120 * H_P = 120 * (1 inch) = 120 inches.

{The final answer is: Naruto can lift a mountain that is 120 inches or 10 feet high.}</s>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

                 [/INST] Let's find the total distance traveled by Mason step by step:

1. First, Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, he covers a distance of: 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles
2. Next, Mason takes a rest for some time. Unfortunately, the problem does not provide information about the duration of his rest or how far he might have traveled during that time. Therefore, we cannot include that distance in our calculation.
3. Finally, Mason goes on for another 6 hours at a rate of 8 miles per hour. He covers a distance of: 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles.

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Mason is: {The final answer is: 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles}. However, this answer assumes that there was no rest or movement during the rest period, which might not be the case based on the problem statement. If you have more information about the duration of the rest, please let me know, and I will adjust my calculation accordingly.</s>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we first need to find the speed of one kangaroo and then determine the speed of each turtle.

1. The total time it takes for 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway is 18 hours.
  - Since all the kangaroos travel at the same speed, we can find the speed of one kangaroo by dividing the total time by the number of kangaroos: Speed of one kangaroo = Total time / Number of kangaroos
  - Speed of one kangaroo = 18 hours / 3
  - Speed of one kangaroo = 6 hours per kangaroo

2. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
  - Speed of one turtle = Speed of one kangaroo / 2
  - Speed of one turtle = 6 hours per kangaroo / 2
  - Speed of one turtle = 3 hours per turtle

3. To find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway, we use the formula: Total time = Total distance / Speed
  - We don't have the total distance given in the problem, so we need to express the total time in terms of the distance: Total time = Distance / Speed
  - Now we can set up an equation: 18 hours (total time for 3 kangaroos) = Distance / 3 hours per kangaroo
  - To find the total time it takes for four turtles, we need to find the distance and then divide that by the speed of four turtles: Total time = Distance / (Speed of one turtle * Number of turtles)

4. To find the distance, we can multiply the total time for three kangaroos by their speed: Distance = 18 hours * 3 hours per kangaroo * 3 kangaroos
  - Distance = 18 hours * 3 hours per kangaroo * 3
  - Distance = 18 * 3 * 3 = 54 squared meters

5. Now, we can find the total time it takes for four turtles to travel across the highway: Total time = Distance / (Speed of one turtle * Number of turtles)
  - Total time = 54 squared meters / (3 hours per turtle * 4 turtles)
  - Total time = 54 / (3 * 4) = 54 / 12 = 4.5 hours

The final answer is: It takes 4.5 hours for four turtles to travel across the highway.</s>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

                 [/INST] First, let's determine the number of dishes that Rory makes. We know that Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, so if Kora made 20 dishes, then Rory made half that amount:

Dishes made by Rory = (1/2) * Dishes made by Jada

Since Kora made 20 dishes less than what Jada made, we can find the number of dishes Jada made by setting up an equation:

Dishes made by Jada = Dishes made by Kora + 20

Now we can find the number of dishes Rory made:

Dishes made by Rory = (1/2) * Dishes made by Jada

Substitute the expression for dishes made by Jada from the previous equation:

Dishes made by Rory = (1/2) * (Dishes made by Kora + 20)

Therefore, the total number of dishes they all make together is the sum of dishes made by each of them:

Total dishes = Dishes made by Jada + Dishes made by Rory + Dishes made by Kora

Substitute the expressions for dishes made by Jada and Rory:

Total dishes = (Dishes made by Kora + 20) + (1/2 * (Dishes made by Kora + 20)) + Dishes made by Kora

Combine like terms:

Total dishes = (3/2 * Dishes made by Kora) + 20

The final answer is:

{The final answer is (3/2) * Dishes made by Kora + 20}

To find the actual number of dishes they make together, you'll need to determine the value of Dishes made by Kora and then substitute that back into the equation.</s>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.
The total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The laptop costs $600.
2. Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200. So, the new price is $600 - $200 = $400.
3. Erika has some savings in her purse. She has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gives her $80. So, in total, she has $150 + $80 = $230.
4. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.
5. Therefore, after paying theextra $50, she will have $230 + $50 = $280in total.
6. However, we want to know how much money she has in her purse before she pays the extra $50.
7. We know that after paying the $50, she will have $280. We also know that before she paid the $50, she had $230. So, the difference between the two amounts is the $50.
8. Thus, before paying the extra $50, Erika had $230 - $50 = $180in her purse.

                 [/INST] To find out how many apple slices are left, we first need to determine the number of slices Adam has consumed and the number of slices he has prepared.

1. The number of slices from one large apple is 5.
2. The number of slices from one small apple is 3.
3. Adam slices 3 large apples, so the number of slices from this is 3 * 5 = 15 slices.
4. Adam slices 5 small apples, so the number of slices from this is 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
5. In total, Adam has consumed 15 + 15 = 30 slices.

Since Adam started with 3 large apples and 5 small apples, and he consumed 30 slices, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the number of consumed slices from the number of prepared slices.

The number of slices left is 3 large apples * 5 slices/apple + 5 small apples * 3 slices/apple - 30 slices = 12 apples * 5 slices/apple + 15 slices/apple - 30 slices = 15 apples * 3 slices/apple = 45 slices.

However, Adam was asked to find the number of slices left, which is not the same as the number of slices he hasn't consumed yet. Since there were 30 slices consumed and 45 slices prepared, 15 slices were left before he even started eating, and now there are none left.

Therefore, the initial statement about there being slices left is incorrect since Adam has already consumed all the slices prepared from the apples. {The final answer is: there are no apple slices left}.</s>","There are 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 large apple slices.

Step 3: Determine how many more liters of milk the farmer needs to produce daily. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day, but currently, he produces 15 liters a day. So, he needs an additional 25 - 15 = <<25-15=10>>10 liters of milk a day.

Step 4: Determine how many more cows he needs to raise in order to produce 10 liters of milk a day. Let's assume that every additional cow produces the same amount of milk as the cows he currently has, which is 5 liters a day.

3. Multiply the number of $20 bills by the value of each bill to find the amount Thea paid with these bills: $70 = 4 × $20.
4. Subtract the amount Thea paid from the cost of thehat to find the change she received: $70 (cost of the hat) - $70 (amount paid) = $0.

However, the question asks for the change in dollars and cents, not as a final amount of $0. To get the amount of change in dollars and cents, we need to assume that Thea spent some small amount of change in addition to the $70, in order to have spent a total of at least $72 (to round down to $70 when expressed as a multiple of $20).

Let's assume Thea spent an additional $8 in coins. She paid a total of $78 in $20 bills and $8 in coins.

1. Calculate the total amount Thea gave to the craftsman: $78 + $8 = $86.

Craig bought 6 squirt guns at $2 each. So, the total cost of squirt guns is:
6 squirt guns * $2/squirt gun = $12

Step 2: Calculate the cost of water balloons.
Craig bought 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each. So, the total cost of water balloons is:
3 packs of water balloons * $3/pack = $9

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of squirt guns and water balloons.
total cost of squirt guns and water balloons = cost of squirt guns + cost of water balloons
= $12 + $9
= $21

Step 4: Craig initially had 2 twenty dollar bills. Each twenty dollar bill has 20 dollars. So the initial amount Craig had is:
initial amount = number of twenty dollar bills * amount on each twenty dollar bill
= 2 * $20
= $40

Step 5: Subtract the total cost of squirt guns and water balloons from the initial amount.
remaining amount = initial amount - total cost of squirt guns and water balloons
= $40 - $21
= $19

{The final answer is: Craig has $19 left.}</s>","Craig starts off with 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Craig spends 6 squirt guns * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12 on squirt guns.
Craig spends 3 packs of water balloons * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9 on water balloons.
Total Craig has spent $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.
Craig has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 remaining.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S. Then Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2S socks.

According to the problem, Jack has half as many dishes as socks. So, Jack has S/2 dishes.

The problem states that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. This means Jack bought S dishes in the store.

Therefore, Peter, with twice as many socks as Jack, bought 2S socks in the store.

Now, we have the following information:
- Jack has S socks and S/2 dishes.
- Jack bought S dishes in the store.
- Peter has 2S socks.

We want to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together.

So, the total number of socks is:
- Jack's socks: S
- Peter's socks: 2S
- Total socks: S + 2S = 3S

The total number of dishes Jack and Peter have is the sum of Jack's dishes and the dishes he bought in the store:

- Jack's dishes: S/2
- Dishes Jack bought: S
- Total dishes: S + S = 2S

Thus, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:

{The final answer is: Total number of socks = 3S, Total number of dishes = 2S}</s>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.

He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we first need to determine the total time available for performances and intermission, and then divide that by the time needed for each group to perform and changeover. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The concert duration is 2 hours, which is equal to 120 minutes (2 hours * 60 minutes/hour).
2. There is a 10-minute intermission, so the total time for performances is 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes.
3. Each group is given 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = 8 minutes of stage time per group.
4. To find out how many groups can perform in the total available time of 110 minutes, we divide the total performance time by the time allotted for one group: 110 minutes / 8 minutes/group = 13.75 groups
5. Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we can only accommodate 13 groups with the given constraints in the concert.

Therefore, {The final answer is 13 groups can perform in the concert}.</s>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

                    Brenda invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original : amount per year. How much in total will she have after 3 years?
                 [/INST] To find the total amount that Brenda will have after 3 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

A = P(1 + r/n) ^ (nt)

Where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including the initial principal P, and the interest
- r is the annual interest rate as a decimal (0.75 in this case since the problem states ""three-quarters of the original amount per year"")
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (since the problem does not state that the interest is compounded, we will assume it is compounded annually)
- t is the number of years

Given:
- P = $300 (initial investment)
- r = 0.75
- n = 1 (annually)
- t = 3

We can calculate the total amount using the formula:

A = P(1 + r) ^ (nt)
= 300(1 + 0.75) ^ (1*3)
= 300(1+0.75) ^ 3
= 300(1.75^3)

Let's calculate the value of 1.75 raised to the third power:
1.75^3 = 3.4621875

Now let's multiply the initial investment amount by this value:
A = 300 * 3.4621875 = $1038.66

White shirts with no collars = 20

Step 2: Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons. This information was given in the problem.

Step 3: Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons. Since 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, then the remaining floral shirts do not have buttons. So, there are:

1. The farmer has 900 eggs.
2. Each tray can hold up to 30 eggs.
3. To find out how many trays he needs, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:
    - Trays = Total eggs / Eggs per tray
    - Trays = 900 eggs / 30 eggs per tray
    - Trays = 30 trays

4. The farmer earns $2.5 for selling one tray.
5. To find out how much the farmer earns from selling all his eggs, we need to multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:
    - Total earnings = Trays sold * Price per tray

3. We're given that James spends $2640 on shoes every year.
4. To find the cost of one pair of shoes, we need to divide the total amount spent on shoes by the number of pairs he buys in a year.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of one basket of red food with a discount.
Given that one basket of red food costs $18 and you get a $2 discount per basket, the cost of one basket of red food after discount is:
$18 - $2 = $16

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of green food.
The cost of one basket of green food is $25. To calculate the cost of 3 baskets, simply multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:
$25 * 3 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 3 baskets of red food with a discount.
Since one basket of red food after discount costs $16 and you're buying 3 baskets, the total cost will be:
$16 * 3 = $48

Step 4: Add the cost of green and red food to find the total cost.
To find the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with a discount, add the cost of the green baskets to the cost of the red baskets:

From the problem statement, we have:

1. X = Y - 3 (You are three years younger than your brother)
2. X = Z + 2 (You are 2 years older than your sister)
3. Y + X + Z = 87 (The sum of all your ages is 87)

Our goal is to solve for X. To do this, we need to find a relationship between Y and Z using equations 1 and 2, and then use that relationship to find X from equation 3.

First, let's combine equations 1 and 2 to eliminate X:

X = Y - 3
X = Z + 2

We can write Y in terms of Z:

Y = X + 3
Y = Z + 2 + 3
Y = Z + 5

Now, we have equations 1', 2', and 3:

1'. X = Y - 3
2'. X = Z + 2
3. Y = Z + 5

By substituting Y from equation 3 into equation 1'):

X = (Z + 5) - 3
X = Z + 2

We can now find X in terms of Z:

X = Z + 2

Now, we can use equation 3 to find a value for Z:

Y + X + Z = 87
(Z + 5) + (Z + 2) + Z = 87
3Z + 7 = 87
3Z = 80

                    Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue . sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will . Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many glue sticks are needed in total for each student.
Since Mr. Jackson's class has 27 students and each student requires 2 glue sticks, we need a total of 27 students * 2 glue sticks/student = <ins>54 glue sticks</ins>.

Step 2: Determine how many glue sticks come in one pack.
We know that each pack contains 8 glue sticks.

Step 3: Calculate how many packs are needed for all the glue sticks required for the students.
We need 54 glue sticks for the students, so we need to calculate how many packs of 8 we need. We do this by dividing the number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks in one pack and then rounding up to get the number of full packs needed.
54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs
Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number: 7 packs

Step 4: Determine how many extra glue sticks will be left over.
Since we bought 7 packs and each pack contains 8 glue sticks, we have 7 packs * 8 glue sticks/pack = <ins>56 glue sticks}. However, we only needed 54 glue sticks for the students. We have 56 - 54 = <ins>2 extra glue sticks</ins>.

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks to ensure that each student has 2 glue sticks and has some extra glue sticks left over. {The final answer is: Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.}</s>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Each infected person infects 6 other people. So, the number of new infections caused by one infected person in a day is 6.

Step 2: Calculate the number of new infections for the initial 10 infected people in the first day.
With 10 infected people, we will have 10 * 6 = 60 new infections in the first day.

Step 3: Add the new infected people to the initial 10, to find out the number of infected people in the second day.
So, the number of infected people in the second day is 10 (initial) + 60 (newly infected in the first day) = 70.

Step 4: Repeat this process for the third day, finding new infections from the 70 infected people.
The number of new infections in the second day is 70 * 6 = 420.

Step 5: Add the new infected people to the previous number of infected people to find the total number of infected people after three days.

Next, we'll determine how many badges Amber earns in a year. We know it takes Amber twice as long as it takes Claire to earn a badge, so she earns one badge every other month (half the time of Claire). Thus, Amber earns 6 badges in a year.

Now we'll find out how many badges Wendy earns in a year; she earns three times the amount of badges as Claire. So Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.

Finally, we'll find the difference in badges earned between Wendy and Amber in a year. Wendy earns 36 badges, and Amber earns 6 badges. So, the difference is 36 - 6 = ³¹ badges.

1. We know that Mr. George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic.
2. There were 50 students at the picnic, and each student was given 10 burritos.
3. So, the number of burritos given to students in total is: 50 (students) x 10 (burritos per student) = 500 burritos.
4. Mr. George ate 20 burritos himself.
5. Therefore, the number of burritos consumed by students and Mr. George is: 500 (for students) + 20 (for Mr. George) = 520 burritos.
6. The total number of burritos that were eaten is 520, and Mr. George had originally ordered 600 burritos.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of green cars as G. Since there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, which number is represented by R, we have:

R = G + 2

Now we know that there are 3 times the number of green cars as blue cars, so the number of blue cars is:

B = 3G

We also know that the rink has a total of 75 cars. We've determined that there are red, green, and blue cars. Let x represent the number of yellow cars. Then, the total number of cars can be represented as:

Total = R + G + B + x

Substituting our known equations (R = G+2 and B = 3G), we get:

Total = (G+2) + G + 3G + x

Solving for x:

x = Total - (G+2) - G - 3G
x = Total - 2G - 3G
x = Total - 5G

Now we need to find the value of G. Remember we have the equation R = G + 2 and R = 12. Solving for G:

G = R - 2
G = 12 - 2
G = 10

Now we have the number of green cars, G = 10. Let's find the number of blue cars, which is B = 3G = 30. And finally, we can find the number of yellow cars by our equation x = Total - 5G.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of books Anne has as A, the number of books Sofie has as S, and the number of books Fawn has as F.

We know two things from the problem:

1. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so S = A + 25.
2. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so A = F - 12.

Now we can solve for F. First, we'll find the value of A. We know A = F - 12, and we also know S = A + 25.

Substitute the first expression for A into the second expression:
S = (F - 12) + 25.

Now solve for F:
S = F + 3 (subtract 12 from S's side, then add 3 to F's side)
S - 3 = F

We know that together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books, so S + A + F = 85.

Replace S with A + 25 and A with F - 12, and solve for F:
(A + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85
3F = 102
F = 102/3

Since the number of books can't be a fraction, there's an error in the given problem. It's not possible for Sofie, Anne, and Fawn to have a total of 85 books with the given relationships between their quantities.

{The final answer is: The problem contains an error.}

Instead, you can try finding integer values for A, S, and F that would satisfy the conditions in the problem. You might want to consider revising the given conditions or the total number of books to find an integer solution.</s>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.

Number of boxes needed = 120 jello cups / 10 jello cups
Number of boxes needed = 12 boxes

Step 5: Determine how much the cost of jello will be for 12 boxes. We know that each three-ounce box costs $1.25.

Total cost = Number of boxes * Cost per box
Total cost = 12 boxes * $1.25/box
Total cost = $15.00

                 [/INST] To find out how much change the seller will give back, we first need to determine how many phones were bought with the given amount of money.

1. The seller bought 5 phones, each costing $700. So the total amount spent on the phones is:
   Number of phones * Price per phone = $3500

2. However, the seller had $4000 in dollar bills. Therefore, the change the seller will give back is:
   Total amount of dollar bills * Change =$500

   To find the change, we need to subtract the total amount spent on the phones from the total amount of dollar bills the seller had.

3. Total amount of dollar bills = $4000
4. Total amount spent on phones = $3500
5. Change = Total amount of dollar bills - Total amount spent on phones = $4000 - $3500 = $500

{The final answer is: $500}</s>","The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.

                    question:
                    Madeline and her roommate, Keenan, share the cost of groceries. In total, they spend about $400 per month. : In . a four-week month, how many dollars does Keenan spend per week if Madeline pays 60% of the cost?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the total amount Madeline spends per month.
Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we can calculate her portion of the bill as follows:
Madeline's share = Total monthly cost * 0.6
Madeline's share = $400 * 0.6
Madeline's share = $240

Step 2: Determine Keenan's share of the monthly cost.
Since Madeline pays $240 and they split the cost evenly between them, we can find Keenan's share as follows:
Keenan's share = Total monthly cost - Madeline's share
Keenan's share = $400 - $240
Keenan's share = $160

Step 3: Determine how many weeks there are in a four-week month.
We know that there are 4 weeks in a four-week month, so we can calculate the number of days in a week for Keenan as follows (assuming we want to find out how many dollars Keenan spends per week):
Days per week = Total number of days in a month divided by 4
Days per week = 30 (average number of days per month) / 4
Days per week = 7.5
Since Keenan cannot split the cost of groceries into half days, we need to round this number up to the nearest whole number to ensure that they both pay an equal share of the cost each week.

Step 4: Calculate how much Keenan spends per week.
Keenan's weekly cost = Keenan's monthly share / Total number of weeks in a month
Keenan's weekly cost = $160 / 4
Keenan's weekly cost = $40

{The final answer is: Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.}</s>","They spend $400/4=$<<400/4=100>>100 per week.
Keenan pays for 100-60=<<100-60=40>>40% of the groceries.
Thus, she spends $100*(40/100)=$<<100*40/100=40>>40 per week.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the number of pieces he consumed on each day and subtract the remaining pieces from the initial amount.

1. On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza:
   Number of pieces eaten on the first day = Total pieces * Consumption ratio
   Number of pieces eaten on the first day = 60 * (2/5) = 48

2. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

3. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. First, we need to calculate the total number of pieces after the first day, and then find out how many pieces were left after the second day:

   Total pieces after the first day = Initial pieces - Pieces eaten on the first day
   Total pieces after the first day = 60 - 48 = 12

   Pieces remaining after the second day = Total pieces after the first day - Pieces eaten on the second day
   Pieces remaining after the second day = 12 - 10 = 2

4. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
   Number of pieces eaten on the third day = Remaining pieces * Consumption ratio
   Number of pieces eaten on the third day = 2 * (7/13) = 7/6.5 ≈ 1.07 (not a whole number, so we can assume he ate either 1 or 2 pieces more)

5. Summing up the pieces consumed on each day:
   Total pieces eaten = Pieces eaten on the first day + Pieces eaten on the second day + (Approximate pieces eaten on the third day)
   Total pieces eaten = 48 + 10 + 1 = 59 (If 1.07 is rounded to 1, and 2 if it's rounded to 2)

{The final answer is 59 or 60 pieces eaten by Tobias, depending on the rounding of the approximation}</s>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.

                 [/INST] First, let's find the cost of one bottle of soda and one bottle of water.

Cost of 7 bottles of soda = $21.00
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * Cost of one bottle of soda

Since we know the cost of 7 bottles, we can set up the equation:
3 * Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7
Cost of one bottle of soda = $21.00 / (3 * 7) = $3.00

Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of water:
Cost of 4 bottles of water = $8.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * Cost of one bottle of water

So, the equation is:
2 * Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00
Cost of one bottle of water = $8.00 / 2 = $4.00

Now, we can find the cost of 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water:
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $4.00 = $8.00

Total cost = Cost of 3 bottles of soda + Cost of 2 bottles of water
Total cost = $9.00 + $8.00 = $17.00

{The final answer is $17.00}.</s>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.
Three bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.
One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.
Therefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Hourly rate = Amount earned / Hours worked

Hourly rate = $33 / 3 hours

Hourly rate = $11 per hour

Now, we can calculate how much Ella would earn for 12 hours of dog walking at this rate:

Amount earned = Hourly rate * Hours worked

Amount earned = $11 per hour * 12 hours

1. Points from multiple-choice questions:
There are 10 multiple-choice questions worth 1 point each. Amy answers 80% of them correctly, so she gets:
Points from multiple-choice = 10 × 0.8 = 8 points

Number of chickens to sell = Profit target (in dollars) / Price per chicken
Number of chickens to sell = $2000 / $50
Number of chickens to sell = 40 chickens

Next, we need to find out how many chickens Isaias will actually sell, as he only plans to sell 3/5 of his chickens:

Number of chickens to sell = Initial chickens on farm * Percentage to sell
Number of chickens to sell = 300 * 3/5
Number of chickens to sell = 180 chickens

Since Isaias plans to sell 40 chickens to make a profit of $2000 and actually sells 180 chickens, we can't determine how much he spent on the chickens he took to the market without more information, as we don't know the cost of each chicken.

Sarah's old rope is 20 meters long, and she sells it for $2 per meter.
Money from selling old rope = Length of old rope * Price per meter of old rope
= 20 meters * $2/meter
= $40

Step 2: Calculate how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.
The price of a new meter of rope is $1.5, so Sarah will spend this amount per meter when buying a new rope.
Cost of new rope = Price per meter of new rope

Step 3: Calculate how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.
Number of meters of new rope = Profit / Price per meter of new rope
= $40 / $1.5/meter
= 26.67 meters
Since we cannot buy a partial meter of rope, the final number of meters Sarah can buy is rounded down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Sarah can buy 26 meters of new rope.

Step 4: Calculate how much the new rope costs, and subtract that amount from the profit to find the remaining amount of money.
Cost of new rope = Number of meters of new rope * Price per meter of new rope

                    question:
                    In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. In how many years will ; her age be ? thrice ! her present age?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:
1. We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
2. We want to find out in how many years her age will be three times her present age (18 years old + 10 years = 28 years old).
3. Let's call the present age of Melanie ""x"". So, in 10 years, her age will be x + 10.
4. We want her age to be three times her present age in x number of years. So, x + 10 = 3x.
5. To find the number of years, we need to solve for x in the equation x + 10 = 3x.
6. First, subtract x from both sides of the equation: 10 = 2x.
7. Then, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x: x = 5.
8. To find the number of years, we can replace x in the original equation with the value we found in step 7: x + 10 = 3x. So, 5 + 10 = 3*5.
9. Solving for the number of years, we have: 15 = 15*3 => 1 = 3. However, this equation is not true. This means that there is an error or misunderstanding in the problem statement, as the present age of Melanie (x) cannot result in her being 18 in 10 years and her age being three times her present age in a given number of years at the same time.

{The problem statement is not valid.}</s>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.
So, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10.
2. Six packets of chicken each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, the cost of 6 packets of chicken is 2 × $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20.
3. Kelly also has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4, so the cost of these is 3 × $4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
4. She has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, so the cost of these is 7 × $4/2 = $<<7*2/2=7>>7.
5. The total cost of all the items in her cart is $10 (bacon) + $20 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $7 (apples) = $<<10+20+12+7=49>>49.
6. Kelly's budget is $65, and she has already spent $49 on the items in her cart, so she has $65 - $49 = $<<65-49=16>>16 left in her budget. {The final answer is $16}.</s>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

                 [/INST] To find the length of Elaina's usual concert, let's first find out how long her extended final concert was, and then subtract the encore time.

1. The extended final concert lasted for 65 minutes.
2. Elaina made this concert twice as long as her usual concert, so the usual concert length would be half of the extended concert length.
3. Therefore, the length of Elaina's usual concert is: {(1/2) * 65} = 32.5 minutes. (The final answer is 32.5 minutes)

However, it's important to note that a concert length cannot be exactly half an hour, so it would be beneficial for Elaina to round up or down to the nearest whole number, depending on her preference and the concert venue's capabilities.

In summary:
1. The extended final concert lasted for 65 minutes.
2. Elaina made this concert twice as long as her usual concert.
3. The usual concert length is half of the extended concert length.
4. Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concert is approximately 32.5 minutes.

Number of pairs = Total number of microphones / 2
= 50 / 2
= 25 pairs

Now, we know that 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. So, let's find out how many microphones will not be able to form pairs and thus won't be placed on the stage:

Microphones not forming pairs = Total number of microphones * Percentage of microphones not forming pairs
= 50 * 20%
= 50 * 0.2
= 10 microphones

Since each microphone takes one slot when forming a pair, the total number of slots on the stage is equal to the number of pairs that were successfully formed:

Number of slots on the stage = 25 pairs

Therefore, we can find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange on the stage by subtracting the number of extra microphones from the total number of pairs:

Pairs arranged on stage = Total number of pairs - Microphones not forming pairs
= 25 - 10
= 15 pairs

1. We know that Ellen spends a total of $11 on carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
2. The cost of two carrots is 2C, since the cost of one carrot is C.
3. The cost of a salad is $6, and the cost of a yogurt is half the cost of a salad, which is $3.
4. So, the total cost of Ellen's daily meals is 2C + $6 + $3 = 2C + $9.
5. We want to find the cost of one carrot (C), so we need to isolate C in the equation.
6. Subtracting the cost of the salad and the yogurt from the total cost, we get C = 2C + $9 - $6 - $3 = 2C + $2.
7. To find the cost of one carrot, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount Ellen spends every day and then divide the remaining cost by the number of carrots she eats.
8. Ellen spends $11 on two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt, so the cost of two carrots is 11 - 6 - 3 = 2C = 2(C), which implies C = C. This means that the cost of one carrot and the cost of two carrots are the same. However, this information is not provided in the question and is inconsistent with the given information about the cost of the yogurt being half the price of the salad. Therefore, the problem has an inconsistency and cannot be solved with the given information.

                    question:
                    Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The : first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as ; many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn ; five , times as she did Joe's. If ; Joe ; paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?
                 [/INST] To determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we first need to find out how much she made from mowing lawns for Kamala and Alba. We are given that:

1. She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did for Joe.
2. She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did for Joe.
3. She made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn.

Let's find out how many times she mowed Joe's lawn. we'll call the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn x:

1. She mowed Kamala's lawn three times x: 3x
2. She mowed Alba's lawn five times x: 5x

We know that her earnings for mowing Joe's lawn is $6, so:

x * $6 = $6

x = 1 (since $6 is not enough to calculate the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn, it is given as a constant)

Now we know that she mowed Joe's lawn once and:

- She mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many: 3 * 1 = 3
- She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many: 5 * 1 = 5

Putting it all together, she earned:

$6 (from mowing Joe's lawn) + (3 * $x from Kamala's lawn) + (5 * $x from Alba's lawn)

We know x = 1, so:

Total earnings for lawn mowing: $6 + 3 * $1 + 5 * $1 = $12

Now we know that Tasha made $12 from lawn mowing last month. We need to find out how much she made from lemonade sales. However, there is no information given about how much she made from selling lemonade. We cannot determine the answer for this part of the question with the provided information.

The final answer is: We cannot determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales based on the given information.</s>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

Step 2: Carl's weight is more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 kg + x, where x is a positive number.

Step 3: Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is (55 + x) + 8 = 61 kg + x.

Step 4: Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is (61 + x) - 5 = 56 + x.

Since all weights are in kg, x must be in kg as well. However, the problem states that ""Carl’s weight is more than Martin’s weight"" and ""Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight,"" but the given weights don't satisfy this condition. Since Martin's weight is 55 kg and Carl's weight is 16 kg, Carl's weight is not more than Martin's weight, and the given weights do not form a consistent set.

1. Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha. Let's represent the number of notebooks Martha had as X. Then Joseph had 3X notebooks.
2. Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so now she has X + 5 notebooks.
3. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we need to subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has.
4. We know that Joseph had 3X notebooks and Martha now has X + 5 notebooks.
5. Therefore, the difference in the number of notebooks they have is (3X) - (X + 5).
6. To simplify the expression, we can distribute the 3 in the first term: 3X - X - 5.
7. This simplifies to 2X - 5.

1. Susan originally made 100 cookies for her nephews.
2. Her husband took 4 cookies for himself, leaving 96 cookies for the nephews.
3. Susan wants to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews.
4. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of nephews: Cookies per nephew = Total cookies / Number of nephews
5.Plugging in the values: Cookies per nephew = 96 / 6
6. Solving the division: Cookies per nephew = 16 with a remainder of 0.

Since there's no remainder, all calculations are whole numbers, which is valid in this case. However, since we can't really have a fraction of a cookie, we should round down to the nearest whole number as a fair distribution.

Let's denote the number of pages Daniel read yesterday as x. Then, Denise read 5 more pages today, which is x + 5.

Comparing the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel, we have:

Denise = x + 5
Daniel = x

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of pages read between the two days:

Difference = Denise - Daniel = (x + 5) - x = 5

{The final answer is: Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel.}

Or, if you want to know how many pages more Denise read in total, instead of just on the second day:

Therefore, there are still enough soup for 2 adults and 4 children to have one bowl each.

Since each child can have one bowl of soup, the number of bowls of soup that the leftovers can provide for each child is:

{number of bowls of soup for each child = total number of bowls of soup in the pot - bowls of soup used for adults}

{number of bowls of soup for each child = 8 - 2}

{number of bowls of soup for each child = 6}

Therefore, each child can have 6 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

1. First, let's find out how much material Jo uses for one small mask:
   She can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   Therefore, the material required for one small mask = Material for 4 small masks / Number of small masks
   = 2 yards / 4
   = 0.5 yards

2. Next, let's find out how much material Jo uses for one large mask:
   She can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   Therefore, the material required for one large mask = Material for 3 large masks / Number of large masks
   = 2.25 yards / 3
   ≈ 0.75 yards

3. Now, let's find out how much material Jo needs for making 20 small masks:
   Material for one small mask = 0.5 yards
   Number of small masks = 20
   Total material required = Material for one small mask * Number of small masks
   = 0.5 yards * 20
   = 10 yards

4. Lastly, let's find out how much material Jo needs for making 8 large masks:
   Material for one large mask ≈ 0.75 yards
   Number of large masks = 8
   Total material required = Material for one large mask * Number of large masks
   = 0.75 yards * 8
   ≈ 6 yards

5. The total material required to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks = Material for small masks + Material for large masks
    = 10 yards + 6 yards
    = 16 yards

{The final answer is 16 yards of material needed}.</s>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.

1. We know that Tim initially has 7 blue shoeboxes and 9 red shoeboxes. In total, he has 16 shoeboxes.
2. Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing, so we need to subtract these from the number of blue shoeboxes he initially had.
   Blue shoeboxes remaining = Initial blue shoeboxes - Used blue shoeboxes
   Blue shoeboxes remaining = 7 - 3
   Blue shoeboxes remaining = 4

3. Tim uses 1/3 of his red shoeboxes for fishing. To find out how many red shoeboxes he used, we can calculate 1/3 of the initial number of red shoeboxes.
   Red shoeboxes used = Initial red shoeboxes * (1/3)
   Red shoeboxes used = 9 * (1/3)
   Red shoeboxes used = 3

                    Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If , Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?
                 [/INST] Let's denote:
D = Duncan's present age = 60
A = Adam's age at a given past time (we'll find this out)

The problem states that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. In mathematical terms, this equation can be written as:

D - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

Now, we can solve for Adam's Age:

1. Subtract 8 from Duncan's present age:
   D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52

2. Replace D - 8 with the equation from the problem:
   60 - 8 = 2 * (A - 4)

3. Solve for A:
   First, divide both sides by 2:
     29.5 = A - 4

   Next, add 4 to both sides:
      33.5 = A

   Therefore, Adam's age four years ago was 33.5.

4. Find Adam's age now:
   We're asked to find Adam's age in 8 years. So, we'll add 8 to his age 4 years ago:
   A = 33.5 + 8 = 41.5

   However, this result seems suspicious (half a year). Let's check our calculations to make sure there wasn't an error.

5. We checked that Duncan's age eight years ago was 2 times Adam's age four years ago, but the problem actually states this relationship for their ages TODAY not then. In the original problem statement, the ages were given as ""Duncan's age now is 60 and eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago"". So according to this, Adam's age now must be half Duncan's age now:
       Adam's age = Duncan's age / 2

   We're given Duncan's age as 60, so:
       Adam's age = 60 / 2 = 30

   Now let's find Adam's age in 8 years:
       Adam's age = 30 + 8 = 38

 {The final answer is: Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years}.</s>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.

                 [/INST] To find out how many bottles of water John drinks during an Extreme Sudoku puzzle, we first need to determine how long it takes him to complete the Extreme Sudoku puzzle.

We know that a normal Sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes, so an Extreme Sudoku puzzle takes him 4 times that long:

Time for Extreme Sudoku = 4 * Time for Normal Sudoku
Time for Extreme Sudoku = 4 * 45 minutes
Time for Extreme Sudoku = 180 minutes

Since John drinks a bottle of water every half hour, we need to find out how many half hours are in 180 minutes to determine how many bottles of water he will drink during an Extreme Sudoku puzzle.

We know that:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 half hour = 30 minutes

Then, we can calculate the number of half hours in 180 minutes:

Number of half hours = Total minutes / Half hour length
Number of half hours = 180 minutes / 30 minutes
Number of half hours = 6

So, John will drink 6 bottles of water during an Extreme Sudoku puzzle.

Each yellow balloon received 3 pieces of bologna.
Let x be the number of yellow balloons.
The total number of bologna is 58, so the number of bologna for yellow balloons is x * 3.

Step 3: Equate the total number of bologna to the number of bologna for red and yellow balloons.
40 (red) + x(yellow) = 58

Step 4: Solve for x (the number of yellow balloons).
First, subtract the number of red balloons from the total number of bologna.

                 [/INST] To find out how much each girl received as allowance, we first need to determine the total amount of money spent by Julia and Nadine on the cake, balloons, and ice cream.

1. The cake cost $11.
2. The cost of buying 1 dozen balloons is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost of 12 balloons is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Therefore, the total amount spent on the surprise is $11 (cake) + $6 (balloons) + $14 (ice cream) = $<<11+6+14=21>>21.

Since Julia and Nadine had the same amount of allowance from their mother, their combined allowance should be twice the total amount spent, meaning that each girl's allowance is half of that amount.

Half of the total amount spent is: $21 / 2 = $<<21/2=10.5>>10.5.

However, since it's unlikely that their mother would give them a half amount, we should check if there's a mistake in the problem or round up their individual allowances to the next dollar. In this case, if we round up their individual allowances, the total amount must be equal to $22 (rounded total of $21), making their individual allowances $<<22/2=11>>11.

{The final answer is: Each girl received $11 as their allowance.}</s>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.

The profit made by each student is the selling price minus the buying price for each lollipop: Profit per student = Selling price - Buying price = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money each student made by selling the average number of lollipops.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of cats Larry has as C, the number of dogs as D, the number of rabbits as R, and the number of fish as F. We are given the following information:

1. C = 3
2. D = 3C
3. R = D - 2
4. F = 3R
5. Gerbils = 1/3F

Now let's compute the number of pets Larry has:

1. Substitute C = 3 into the equation for D: D = 3 * 3 = 9
2. Substitute C = 3 into the equation for R: R = 9 - 2 = 7
3. Substitute R = 7 into the equation for F: F = 3 * 7 = 21
4. Substitute F = 21 into the equation for gerbils: Gerbils = 1/3 * 21 = 7

Thus, the number of pets Larry has is C + D + R + F + Gerbils = 3 + 9+ 7 + 21 + 7 = 39

{The final answer is: Larry has 39 pets.}</s>","Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that there are 24 slices in a loaf of bread.

Step 2: Abby can eat 2 slices a day, so the number of days the bread lasts for her is:
Number of days for Abby = Total slices / Slices per day
= 24 slices / 2 slices per day
= 12 days

Step 3: Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so the number of slices he eats per day is:
Slices per day for Josh = Slices per day for Abby * 2
= 2 slices per day * 2
= 4 slices per day

Step 4: The number of days the bread lasts for Josh is:
Number of days for Josh = Total slices / Slices per day for Josh
= 24 slices / 4 slices per day
= 6 days

Step 5: Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for a total of 12 days for Abby and 6 days for Josh.

{The final answer is: The loaf of bread will last for a total of 18 days (12 days for Abby + 6 days for Josh)}

Note: There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as the final answer does not match the given information (24 slices). The correct answer should be 18 days to make the bread last for both Abby and Josh.</s>","Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.
So, a loaf of bread will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.

First, let's find out how many shells Martha collects in a year:
1 shell per month = 12 shells per year

Next, let's find out how many years there are between Martha's 5th and 10th birthdays:
10th birthday - 5th birthday = 5 years

Now, we can find the total number of shells Martha has collected by multiplying the number of shells she collects in a year by the number of years she has been collecting:

Total number of shells = Shells per year * Number of years
Total number of shells = 12 shells/year * 5 years
Total number of shells = 60 shells

{The final answer is: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.}</s>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, we first need to find out how many cups are in each row for both chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can find the number of cups in one row for one type of tea, and then double that number to find the number of cups for both types of tea.

Let's call the number of cups in one row for one type of tea ""x"".

1. Total number of cups for chamomile and mint tea in each row is 2 (types of tea) * x.
2. We know that Lana has a total of 27 cups and the number of cups for cinnamon tea is 15. So the number of cups in all three rows for chamomile and mint tea is 3 * (x + x) = 3 * 2x = 6x.
3. Since she has a total of 27 cups, we can find the value of x by subtracting the number of cups for cinnamon tea from the total number of cups: 27 - 15 = 12.
4. Therefore, each row contains x = 12 / 2 = 6 cups of tea for one type. Since there are 2 types of tea in each row, there are 6 * 2 = 12 cups of tea in each row.
5. Half of those cups are mint tea, so there are 12 / 2 = 6 cups of mint tea in each row.

{The final answer is: There are 6 cups of mint tea in each row.}</s>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.

For a meal of berries, it takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, ! and climb back up into his tree. :  Assuming . he picks the same number of berries on each trip, what is the least number of berries he can pick up per trip down to the ground if he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours?
                 [/INST] To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we need to first determine how many trips the sloth makes in 8 hours and then find the minimum number of berries picked up in each trip.

We know that it takes 4 hours to make one round trip (go down, pick berries, and climb back up the tree). So, the time taken for one round trip is 4 hours.

Therefore, the time taken for 8 hours is 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 hours.

Since the sloth can only make one round trip in 4 hours, in 8 hours, the sloth can make 8 hours / 4 hours/trip = <<8/4>>2 trips.

Let x be the number of berries the sloth picks in one trip.

Then, in 8 hours, the sloth picks up a total of 2 * x berries.

To find the minimum value of x, we set up the inequality:

2x >= 24 (since the sloth must pick up at least 24 berries)

Now, let's find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality:

x >= 24 / 2
x >= 12

The smallest integer value of x that satisfies the inequality is x = 13.

However, this means the sloth will collect more than 24 berries in 8 hours. The question asks for the least number of berries that the sloth can pick up per trip to collect exactly 24 berries in 8 hours. Unfortunately, based on the given information, it is not possible to pick up exactly 24 berries in 8 hours as the sloth can only make 2 trips in 8 hours, and he picks up a minimum of 13 berries per trip.

Therefore, the answer to this question is ambiguous, and it depends on whether we focus on minimizing the number of trips or the number of berries picked up per trip.

{The final answer is:

- If we focus on minimizing the number of trips: The sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours, and each trip has a minimum of 13 berries, for a total of 2 * 13 = <<2*13=26>>26 berries
- If we focus on minimizing the number of berries picked up per trip: The sloth cannot pick up exactly 24 berries in 8 hours, and it is not possible to determine the minimum number of berries that can be picked up per trip to collect exactly 24 berries in 8 hours with the given information.}

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. Since a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal one, we can find the calories in a mini cinnamon roll as follows:
Calories in one mini cinnamon roll = Calories in one normal cinnamon roll / 3

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate the number of Junebugs Rita removed on Tuesday and Wednesday. She removed twice as many on those days as she did on Monday, so:

Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 * Junebugs removed on Monday
                                                          = 2 * 39
                                                          = 78

Next, let's calculate the total number of Junebugs Rita removed during the whole week:

Total Junebugs removed = Junebugs removed on Monday + Junebugs removed on Tuesday + Junebugs removed on Wednesday + Junebugs removed on Thursday + Junebugs removed on Friday
                                 = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
                                 = 216

To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we can divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days in the week:

Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
                                               = 216 / 5
                                               = 43.2

However, since it's not possible to remove a fraction of a Junebug, we can't consider the result of 43.2 as the average number of Junebugs removed per day. Instead, we can round up or down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we could round down to 43, but a more reasonable answer would be to round up to the next whole number and consider that Rita removed an additional Junebug on one of the days. So:

The final answer is: Rita removes an average of 44 Junebugs per day.</s>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs

The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number ; of toys . for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Sophie starts with the following toys for her nephew:
- Bag of building blocks: 31 blocks
- Bin of stuffed animals: 8 stuffed animals
- Tower of stacking rings: 9 multicolored rings

Step 2: Sophie adds the toys from a tube of bouncy balls to reach a total of 62 toys for her nephew.

Step 3: We want to find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube. So, we need to find the difference between the total number of toys after the tube was added and the initial number of toys.

Step 4: First, let's calculate the initial number of toys: 31 building blocks + 8 stuffed animals + 9 multicolored rings = 48 toys

Step 5: We know that the total number of toys after adding the bouncy balls is 62.

Step 6: So, the difference in the number of toys is 62 (total) - 48 (initial) = 14 toys

Step 7: Therefore, the number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.

The final answer is: There were 14 bouncy balls in the tube.</s>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of John as J and the age of Paul as P. According to the problem, we know that:

1. Peter's age (Peter = P) is equal to the sum of Paul's and John's ages: P = P + J.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John: P = J + 10.
3. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old: P + P + J = 100.

Let's solve the system of equations:

First, find the value of J from the second equation: J = P - 10

Now substitute J in the third equation:

P + P + (P - 10) = 100

Combine like terms: 2P - 10 = 100

Add 10 to both sides: 2P = 111

Divide by 2: P = 55.5

Since ages are integers, we can conclude that there is an inconsistency in the given information or the problem has inaccurate data. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's try using the closest integer value to our calculation:

P = 55, and J = P - 10 = 45

So, if we assume that Paul and John's ages are 55 and 45, respectively, then Peter's age would be:

Peter = P = 55.

However, please note that this result is based on an inconsistency in the problem's original information.

{The final answer is : Peter's age is 55 (with an inconsistency in the problem).}</s>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spit by Zoey:
Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each seed a total distance of 10 feet.
Total distance spit by Zoey = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
Total distance spit by Zoey = 40 seeds * 10 feet
Total distance spit by Zoey = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spit by Sydney:
Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each seed a total distance of 12 feet.
Total distance spit by Sydney = Number of seeds * Distance per seed
Total distance spit by Sydney = 35 seeds * 12 feet
Total distance spit by Sydney = 420 feet

Step 3: Find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney:
Average total distance = (Total distance spit by Zoey + Total distance spit by Sydney) / Number of contestants
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2
Average total distance = 410 feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets produced by both machines in a day.
Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets an hour, so in a day (24 hours), it produces:
60 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day

Similarly, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets an hour, so in a day, it produces:
45 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day = 1140 widgets/day

Step 2: Calculate the number of widgets produced by both machines in a month (30 days).
For the Widgeteer 3000, the number of widgets produced in a month is:
1440 widgets/day × 30 days/month = 43,200 widgets/month

For the WidgetMaster 9000, the number of widgets produced in a month is:
1140 widgets/day × 30 days/month = 34,200 widgets/month

Step 3: Calculate the revenue for both machines in a month.
Each widget sells for $6, so the monthly revenue for the Widgeteer 30,000 is:
43,200 widgets/month × $6/widget = $259,200

The monthly revenue for the WidgetMaster 9000 is:
34,200 widgets/month × $6/widget = $205,200

Step 4: Find the difference in monthly revenue between both machines.
Revenue difference = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
Revenue difference = $259,200 - $205,200
Revenue difference = $54,000

Step 4: Calculate the cost Cameron would pay for his desired 14-hour stay (initial 12 hours plus 2 additional hours).
12 hours * 1000 pesos/hour + 2 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 12,140 pesos

Step 5: Calculate the difference in cost between a 14-hour stay without extra hours and a 14-hour stay with extra hours.

12,005 pesos - 12,140 pesos = -135 pesos

However, the result is negative. This indicates that Cameron would end up paying more by choosing this option. The mistake in the question is that the cost of the 12 hours at the starting price is less than the cost of 12 hours at the hourly rate charged for additional hours. This is not possible in this scenario.

Therefore, based on the provided information, we cannot calculate the amount of money Cameron would save. The given information seems to be inconsistent, leading to incorrect results.</s>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.

                 [/INST] Let's go through this problem step by step:

1. The teacher has 29 pupils in her class.
2. Each pupil receives 2 bottles of apple juice from the teacher, so the teacher distributes a total of 2 * 29 = 58 bottles of apple juice to the students.
3. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher can redeem her coupons for a total of 9 * 100 = 900 bottles of apple juice.
4. The teacher has already given 2 bottles to each pupil, so she has distributed a total of 58 bottles from the 900 bottles she obtained through coupon redemption.
5. To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we need to find the difference between the total number of bottles she obtained and the number of bottles she distributed.
6. So, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself is 900 (total bottles obtained) - 58 (bottles distributed) = 842 bottles.

                 [/INST] To find out how much Patty charged for the job, we need to calculate the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost separately, and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the visit fee:
Visit fee = $40

Step 2: Calculate the labor cost:
Labor cost = hourly rate * hours worked
Hourly rate = $35 per hour
Hours worked = 2.25 hours

Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours
Labor cost = $82.13 {We'll round up since Patty wouldn't charge in fractions of a dollar}

Step 3: Calculate the parts cost:
Parts cost = $60

Step 4: Find the total charge:
Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total charge = $40 + $82.13 + $60
Total charge = $182.13

{The final answer is: Patty charged $182.13 for the job.}</s>","She charged for 3 hours.

                    James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets , them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he out?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the CDs that James kept.
Discounted price = Original price * (1 - Discount percentage)
Original price = Price of one CD = $15
Discount percentage = 40% = 0.4

Discounted price = $15 * (1 - 0.4)
Discounted price = $15 * 0.6
Discounted price = $9

Since James bought 10 CDs, the total discounted cost of the CDs he kept is:

Total discounted cost = Discounted price per CD * Number of CDs
Total discounted cost = $9 * 10
Total discounted cost = $90

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the CDs he didn't like.
Revenue = Selling price * Number of CDs sold
Selling price = $40 (given in problem)
Number of CDs sold = 5 (given in problem)

Revenue = $40 * 5
Revenue = $200

Step 3: Subtract the revenue from the total discounted cost to find out how much money James was out.

Total amount out = Total discounted cost - Revenue
Total amount out = $90 - $200
Total amount out = -$110

However, this answer does not make sense in the context of the problem, as we cannot have a negative amount of money that James was out.

3. Since Jen has 6 yams and each yam can be sold for $1.5:
5. Earnings from selling yams = Number of yams * Price per yam
6. Earnings from selling yams = 6 * $1.5
7. Earnings from selling yams = $9

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from selling sweet potatoes.
8. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes and each can be sold for $2:
9. Earnings from selling sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes * Price per sweet potato
10. Earnings from selling sweet potatoes = 10 * $2
11. Earnings from selling sweet potatoes = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from selling carrots.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  ; How long did . it take him to get across the lake?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims initially.
- James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
- He swims 60% of the distance.

Let's denote the total distance of the lake as ""d"". Then:
Distance James swims initially = d * 0.6

Step 2: Determine the swimming time for the initial distance.
Swimming time = Distance / Speed
Swimming time = (d * 0.6) / 2 miles per hour

Step 3: Calculate the resting time.
Resting time = Swimming time / 2

Step 4: Calculate the swimming time for the remaining distance.
- James swims the remaining distance at half his initial speed.
- The distance he swims at half speed is d * 0.4 (since he swam 60% initially).

Initial speed = 2 miles per hour
Half speed = Initial speed / 2 = 1 mile per hour

Swimming time for remaining distance = d * 0.4 / 1 mile per hour

Step 5: Calculate the total time taken by James.
Total time = Swimming time + Resting time
Total time = [(d * 0.6) / 2 hours] + [([d * 0.6] / 2 hours) / 2] + [d * 0.4 / 1 hour]

Step 6: Simplify the equation.
Total time = [(d * 0.6) / 2 hours] + [(d * 0.6) / 4 hours] + [d * 0.4 hours]
Total time = [(d * 0.6) / 2 hours] + [d * 0.6 / 2 hours] + [d * 0.4 hours]
Total time = (d * 0.6) / 1 hour * [1 + 1/2 + 1/2]

Step 7: Simplify the fraction [1 + 1/2 + 1/2].
This is a simple geometric series with a common ratio of 1. Given that the sum of an infinite geometric series S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio, we have:

S = (d * 0.6) / 1 hour * [1 + (1/2) + (1/2)]
S = (d * 0.6) / 1 hour * [(1+1)/2]
S = (d * 0.6) / 1 hour * [2/2]
S = (d * 0.6) / 1 hour * [1]
S = (d * 0.6) hours

Therefore, the total time taken by James to get across the lake is {The final answer is (d * 0.6) hours}.</s>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                    Marcus is half of Leo’s age and five years younger than ? Deanna. Deanna is ? 26. How old is Leo?
                 [/INST] Let's call Deanna's age D, and Marcus' age M. According to the problem, Marcus is half of Leo's age and five years younger than Deanna. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

M = Leo's age - (half of Leo's age) - 5
M = Leo's age - Leo's age/2 - 5

Now, we know that Deanna's age is 26, and Marcus is five years younger than Deanna:

M = Leo's age - (Leo's age/2 - 5)

To solve this equation, we first need to get all the variables on one side. We can do this by moving all terms involving Leo's age to the left side and constants to the right.

Leo's age = M + Leo's age/2 + 5

Now we have a quadratic equation in terms of Leo's age. To find the solution, we can try solving it by guessing or factoring, but since it is not given that Leo's age is an integer, it would be difficult. Instead, we can use the quadratic formula:

Leo's age = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/2a

Where a = 1, b = -1, and c = M + 5

Plugging in these values, we get:

Leo's age = (-(-1) ± √((-1)² - 4(1)(M+5)))/2(1)

Simplifying the equation:

Leo's age = (1 ± √(1 + 4M + 20))/2

Leo's age = (1 ± √(4M+21))/2

To find the exact ages, we would need to calculate the two possible solutions, but since the problem does not ask for specific ages and just asks for Leo's age, we can conclude that Leo's age is somewhere in the range of (1 +√(4M+21))/2 and (1-√(4M+21))/2.

For example, if M = 10, then the possible ages for Leo are:

(1 + √(4*10 + 21))/2 = (1 + √26)/2
(1 - √(4*10 + 21))/2 = (1 - √26)/2

Therefore, the final answer is Leo's age is somewhere between (1 + √26)/2 and (1 - √26)/2. {The final answer is Leo's age is approximately 29 or 13} (Depending on whether we take the positive or negative root.) Note that the exact ages cannot be given due to the nature of the quadratic equation. If we knew Marcus' age, we could find the exact ages, but based on the given information, the range of possible ages for Leo is all that can be determined.</s>","Marcus is 26 - 5 = <<26-5=21>>21 years old.

                 [/INST] Let's find out how many points Azibo scored:

1. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored, so Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo. Therefore, Bahati scored (Azibo's points) + 20.
2. Similarly, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar scored (Bahati's points) - 10.
3. All three of them together contributed 45 points. So, Bahati's points + Azibo's points + Dinar's points = 45.
4. Substitute the expressions for Bahati's and Dinar's points from the first two steps into the equation: (Azibo's points) + (Azibo' points + 20) + (Bahati's points - 10) = 45.
5. Simplify the equation: 2*Azibo's points + 20 + Bahati's points - 10 = 45
6. Combine like terms: 2*Azibo's points + Bahati's points + 10 = 45
7. Move the variable term to one side: 2*Azibo's points + Bahati's points = 35
8. Solve for Bahati's points: Bahati's points = 35 - 2*Azibo's points
9. Substitute the equation for Bahati's points from step 8 into the equation from step 5: 2*Azibo's points + (35 - 2*Azibo's points) + 10 = 45
10. Simplify the equation: 2*Azibo's points + 35 - 2*Azibo's points + 10 = 45
11. Eliminate the common term: 15 + 10 = 25
12. Subtract 10: 5 = Bahati's points
13. Now that we have Bahati's points, we can find Azibo's points: Azibo's points = Bahati's points - 20 = 5 - 20 = -15. However, this is not a valid solution since it implies a negative number of points.

It's important to note that the problem as it is stated does not make sense, as the given information indicates that Bahati scored fewer points than both Bahati and Dinar, which is not possible. Therefore, the problem presented is not valid and doesn't have a clear solution. {The final answer cannot be determined with the given information}</s>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored

Since each page is printed on both sides, there are two facets (or sides) to every page. Therefore, we have twice as many pages as inches, since each inch contains 100 pages.

We're also given that the book is 1.5 inches thick. So, the number of pages in the book is twice the number of inches, multiplied by the number of pages in one inch.

Let's write this down in a clear and step-by-step manner.

**Step 1:** We know there are 100 pages to the inch, indicating that each inch consists of 100 pages.

**Step 2:** Since each page is printed on both sides, there are two facets (or sides) to every page. This means that for every inch, we actually have pages for 100 * 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 pages.

                 [/INST] To find out how many reports Vince stapled in total, we first need to determine how many reports he staples in an hour and then use that information to calculate how many hours he works and how many reports he staples during that time.

1. Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. Time elapsed to staple 30 reports is 15 minutes.
2. In order to find out how many reports Vince staples in an hour, we first need to find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in an hour.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and each minute can be divided into 2 segments of 30 seconds, making 2 intervals of 15 minutes in an hour.
4. Therefore, in an hour, Vince staples: ReportsStapledPerHour = ReportsPer15minutes * IntervalsPerHour = 30 * 2 = 60 reports
5. Vince works from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which is 15 hours (since there are 2 hours in the evening, and we don't count midnight as an hour).
    Start_time = 8:00 AM = 8 hours
    End_time = 11:00 PM = 23 hours
    Total_working_hours = 23 hours
6. To calculate the total number of reports Vince stapled, we can use the following formula:
    ReportsStapledTotal = ReportsPerHour * Total_working_hours = 60 * 15 = 900 reports

{The final answer is 900 reports}.</s>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).
From 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.

Her usual sleeping hours are from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Adding the extra 5 minutes she woke up early for the bathroom, her total sleeping time that day is:

Total sleeping time = Usual sleeping hours + Extra time
= 8 hours + 5 minutes
= 480 minutes + 300 seconds ( since 5 minutes = 300 seconds )
= 510 minutes

However, we also know that she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. which is a difference of 23 minutes. This means that she was not sleeping in her bed during that time, so we need to subtract the time she spent sleepwalking from her total sleeping time to find out how many minutes she spent in her bed that day:

Minutes spent in bed = Total sleeping time - Time spent sleepwalking
= 510 minutes - 23 minutes
= 487 minutes

                    ! Jonathan has . 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. If he has two dozen cups and gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons ; for his birthday, ? calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining.
                 [/INST] Solution:

1. First, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan originally has. We know that he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups, and he has 2 dozen (or 24) measuring cups.
2. So, to find out the number of measuring spoons, we can set up the following proportion:
   measuring spoons / measuring cups = 2/3
   Let S be the number of measuring spoons and C be the number of measuring cups:
   S / C = 2/3
3. Cross-multiplying this proportion, we get:
   SC = 2C / 3
   Solving for S, we get:
   S = 2C / 3
4. Substituting the value of C, we get:
   S = 2 * 24 / 3
5. Doing the multiplication and division, we get:
   S = 48
   {So, Jonathan originally has 48 measuring spoons}.
6. After giving Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has:
   S_remaining = S - 6
   Substituting the value of S, we get:
   S_remaining = 48 - 6
7. Doing the subtraction, we get:
   S_remaining = 42
   {Therefore, Jonathan has 42 measuring spoons remaining}.</s>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds in the hospital.
Since 1/5 of the hospital's beds are occupied, we can find the number of occupied beds by:
Occupied_beds = Total_beds * Occupancy_rate
Occupied_beds = 1000 * 1/5
Occupied_beds = 2000/5
Occupied_beds = 400

Step 2: Calculate the number of new patients admitted in 2 weeks.
New_patients_per_day = 50
Days_in_2_weeks = 14 (Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks has 14 days)
Total_new_patients = New_patients_per_day * Days_in_2_weeks
Total_new_patients = 50 * 14
Total_new_patients = 700

Step 3: Calculate the number of occupied beds due to new admissions.
Occupied_beds_due_to_new_admissions = Total_new_patients
Occupied_beds_due_to_new_admissions = 700

Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital.
Total_unoccupied_beds = Total_beds - Occupied_beds_due_to_new_admissions
Total_unoccupied_beds = 1000 - 700
Total_unoccupied_beds = 300

{The final answer is 300 unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.}</s>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, let's find out how many work emails Robyn sends a day. We know she sends 16 emails a day and 7 of those are work emails. So,

Number of work emails = Total emails sent * Percentage of work emails
= 16 * 0.44 (since 7 out of 16 is 0.44)
= 7

Step 2: Now, we need to find out how many emails are left for family and her boyfriend. We know that 2/3 of the remaining emails are to family, and 1/3 are to her boyfriend. Let's denote the number of remaining emails as 'x'.

x * (1/3) = Number of emails to her boyfriend
x * (2/3) = Number of emails to family

Step 3: To find the number of emails to family, we can write an equation: x * (2/3) = Number of family emails. Since we don't have the number of emails to family, we can't directly find the number of emails to her boyfriend from this equation.

Step 4: However, we know that the total number of work and family emails is 13 (7 work emails + 6 family emails). So we have: 13 = 7 + x * (2/3)

Step 5: We can now solve for 'x', the number of remaining emails:

x * (2/3) = 6
x = 6 * (3/2)
x = 9

So, the remaining number of emails is 9.

Step 6: Now, we can find the number of emails to her boyfriend:

Number of emails to boyfriend = x * (1/3)
= 9 * (1/3)
= 3

The final answer is: Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.</s>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

1. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
2. Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old.

Let's represent the ages as follows:
- Shawna's age = S
- Shawna's father's age = F
- Aliya's age = A

1. We know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna: F = 5S
2. We also know that Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya: S = 3A

Now we can express F in terms of A:

F = 5S
F = 5 * 3A
F = 15A

{The final answer is Shawna's father is 15 times as old as Aliya.}

To find the actual age of Shawna's father, we just need to substitute the given value of Aliya's age:

F = 15 * 3
F = 45

However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number . of people in attendance by ; 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?
                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Courtney reported the number of people at the concert as 48.

Step 2: Kelly mentioned that Courtney overstated the number of people by 20%. So, the actual number of people at the concert can be found by subtracting the overstatement from Courtney's reported number.

Step 3: The overstatement was 20% of 48 people. To find this, we multiply the reported number by the percentage as a decimal.

Overstatement = Reported number * Percentage as decimal
                    = 48 * 0.2
                    = 9.6
                    = 10 (rounding up because we can't have a fraction of a person)

Step 4: To find the actual number of people at the concert, we subtract the overstatement from the reported number.

Actual number of people = Reported number - Overstatement
                                    = 48 - 10
                                    = 38

If Jason had picked up and carried , 2 balls, what is the total number of ; balls that the coach brought to practice?
                 [/INST] Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of basketballs carried by each boy in one trip as follows:
   - Jordan: xJ
   - Jason: xS
   - Jeffrey: xF

2. We know that the three boys picked up and carried all the balls in one trip. So the total number of balls carried by them is:
   xJ + xS + xF

3. We also know that Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason:
   xJ = 2 × xS

4. We also know that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
   xS = 2 × xF

5. Substituting xS in terms of xF in the expression for the total number of balls carried:
   xJ + xS + xF = xJ + 2× xF + xF

6. Simplifying the expression, we can express xJ in terms of xF:
   xJ = (3 × xF)

7. Now, we know that the three boys picked up all the balls in one trip. So, the total number of balls is equal to the number of balls carried by each boy in one trip:

   Total number of balls = xJ + xS + xF

8. Substituting xJ with (3 × xF), and xS with (2 × xF):

   Total number of balls = (3 × xF) + (2 × xF) + xF

9. Simplifying the expression:

   Total number of balls = 6 × xF

10. We don't have a direct value for xF, but we do know that Jason carried 2 balls less than half the total number of balls. Let's denote the total number of balls as N. Since Jason carried half of that:

    xS = N/2

11. Substituting xS with N/2 in xS = 2 × xF, we can find xF:

    2 × xF = N/2
    xF = N/4

12. Now, we can find the total number of balls:

    Total number of balls = 6 × xF
    Total number of balls = 6 × (N/4)

13. Multiplying and dividing by 4:

    Total number of balls = (3/2) × N

{The final answer is (3/2) × N}

This means that the total number of basketballs Coach brought to practice is (3/2) times the number of balls each boy picked up and carried in one trip.</s>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.
In total, the three boys carried 4+2+1=<<4+2+1=7>>7 balls, which were all the balls the coach brought to practice.

                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The number of holes dug on the first day was 10.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 more holes, so the total number of holes after the second day is 10 + 13 = 23 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 more holes, for a total of 23 + 8 = 31 holes. However, they had to fill in 2 holes that were not profitable, so the total number of holes on the island by the end of the third day was 31 - 2 = 30 holes.
4. The problem states that by the fourth day, there were four times as many holes on the island as there were on the first day. So, the number of holes on the island by the fourth day was 10 * 4 = 40 holes.
5. Since they dug more holes and filled in some unprofitable ones, the number of holes they dug specifically on the fourth day before finding the treasure is the difference between the total number of holes by the end of the fourth day and the total number of holes on the island after the third day. 

{The final answer is 40 holes - 30 holes = 10 holes}

Therefore, they dug 10 additional holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.</s>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.

After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

If Amora and Lainey ! got 70 corn chips each, how many corn chips were there altogether?
                 [/INST] Let's reason through this step-by-step:

1. We know that Amora and Lainey each get 70 corn chips, and the third person, Collins, gets 15 more than what Amora and Lainey get.
2. Since Amora and Lainey get equal portions, the total number of corn chips for them is 2 * (Amora and Lainey's shared portion).
3. Therefore, Collins gets a portion that is 15 more than their shared portion, so the total number of corn chips for Collins is (2 * (Amora and Lainey's shared portion) + 15).
4. According to the problem statement, we have: 2 * (Amora and Lainey's shared portion) + Collins' portion = Total number of corn chips.
5. Since Amora and Lainey each get 70 corn chips, we can find their shared portion: Amora and Lainey's shared portion = 70 corn chips / 2 = 35 corn chips each.
6. Substituting this value into the equation above, we get: 2 * 35 + 70 = 2 * x + 15 + 70, where x represents the number of corn chips Amora and Lainey share, and the total number of corn chips is represented on the right-hand side of the equation.
7. Simplifying both sides of the equation, we find: 2 * x = 135.
8. Solving for x, we find that x = 67.5. However, since it's not possible to divide corn chips into halves in reality, we must assume their allocated portions were rounded or approximated to the nearest whole number.
9. Rounding up their portions, Amora and Lainey would each receive 36 corn chips instead of 35, which would result in a total of 72 corn chips for the first two people.
10. Now, Collins would get an equal amount plus 15, so the total number of corn chips for Collins is 72 + 15 = 87 corn chips.
11. Consequently, the total number of corn chips is 72 (for Amora and Lainey) + 87 (for Collins) = 159 corn chips.

{The final answer is 159 corn chips.}</s>","If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they received a total of 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 corn chips.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's denote the cost of supplies as S. We know that the cost of travel is 50% more than the supplies, so the cost of travel is 1.5 * S.

Step 2: We also know that the total cost of both supplies and travel is $400. So we have the equation S + Travel = $400

Step 3: Substituting the expression for travel from Step 1 into this equation, we get S + 1.5S = $400

Step 4: Combining the terms with S on the left side, we have 2S = $400

Step 5: Solving for S, we divide both sides by 2, S = $200

Step 6: Going back to the expression for travel from Step 1, we have Travel = 1.5 * S = 1.5 * $200 = $300

The final answer is: Travel costs $300.</s>","He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies

                 [/INST] Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan, so the number of Pokemon that Stan has caught is:
   Stan's number of Pokemon = Alex's number of Pokemon - 5
3. We also know that Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokemon than 4 times the number of Pokemon that Adelwolfe has caught. In other words:
   4 * Adelwolfe's number of Pokemon > Stan's number of Pokemon + 13

Now we have two equations regarding the number of Pokemon caught by Stan and Adelwolfe:

1. Stan's number of Pokemon = Alex's number of Pokemon - 5
2. 4 * Adelwolfe's number of Pokemon > Stan's number of Pokemon + 13

To find the values for Stan's and Adelwolfe's numbers of Pokemon that satisfy both equations, we can create a systematic method as follows:

Let's assume Adelwolfe caught X Pokemon:

1. Stan's number of Pokemon = Alex's number of Pokemon - 5 = (X + 5)
2. 4 * X > (X + 5) + 13

Let's break this down further:

- Alex's number of Pokemon = X + 5
- Stan's number of Pokemon = X

Now let's test the second equation:

4 * X > X + 5 + 13

Simplify:

4 * X > X + 18
3 * X > 18

Since X > 18 / 3, X > 6, this means Adelwolfe must have caught more than 6 Pokemon.

Let's try X = 7:

4 * 7 > 1 + 5 + 13
28 > 12

Since this is not true, we need to test the next number. Let's assume Adelwolfe caught 8 Pokemon:

4 * 8 > 1 + 5 + 13
32 > 12

Since 32 > 12, the second equation is satisfied.

Now let's test the first equation:

Stan's Pokemon = X = 8 - 5 = 3

Since the first equation is also satisfied, we've found the correct values for Stan and Adelwolfe's Pokemon counts: Stan caught 3 Pokemon and Adelwolfe caught 8 Pokemon.

{The final answer is Stan caught 3 Pokemon and Adelwolfe caught 8 Pokemon}.</s>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught
Stan: 4x-13

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that each episode is 20 minutes long.

Step 2: The number of episodes is half the number of minutes in total. So, we need to find the total number of minutes for all episodes.

Let's denote the number of episodes as 'n'.Then, the total number of minutes for all episodes would be n * 20 minutes. By the problem statement, n = total minutes / minutes per episode.

Step 3: Substituting 'n' with total minutes/minutes per episode in the equation, we get: total minutes = (total minutes / minutes per episode) * minutes per episode

Step 4: Simplifying the equation, we have total minutes = total minutes * (1 / 0.5)

Step 5: Since 1/0.5 = 2, we have total minutes = total minutes * 2

Step 6: This implies that the total number of minutes for all episodes is twice the number of minutes in a single episode. Therefore, total minutes = 2 * 20 = 40 minutes.

{The final answer is: John will spend 40 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.}</s>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.

1. First, let's find the distance the bird traveled during the first leg of her journey, which is flying south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.

Distance1 = Speed * Time
Distance1 = 30 miles per hour * 10 hours
Distance1 = 300 miles

2. Next, we need to find the distance the bird traveled during the second leg of her journey, which is flying north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.

Distance2 = Speed * Time
Distance2 = 18 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance2 = 36 miles

3. In the third leg of her journey, the bird flew towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

Distance3 = Speed * Time
Distance3 = 22 miles per hour * 5 hours
Distance3 = 110 miles

4. To find the total distance the bird traveled during her entire journey, we simply add up the distances she covered in each leg.

Total Distance = Distance1 + Distance2 + Distance3
Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles
Total Distance = 446 miles

{The final answer is 446 miles}.</s>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of brownies Greta made for herself and the numbers of brownies she received from her office and friends.

- She made a batch for herself, and 1 batch is typically 12 brownies. So, Greta made 12 brownies for herself.
- She received one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies from her office, so she had an additional 12 brownies.
- Her friends sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies, so she had an additional 6 brownies.
- At her surprise party, 4 dozen brownies were waiting, and there are 12 brownies in a single dozen, so her friends provided her with 48 brownies.

So, Greta ended up with 12 (from herself) + 12 (from her office) + 6 (from her coworkers) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies in total.

Step 2: Calculate the number of individual brownies eaten during the surprise party.

We are told that 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten during the party. Since there are 12 brownies in a dozen, 1 1/2 dozen equals 12 * (1 + 1/2) = 15 brownies.

Step 3: Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies Greta had to find the number left over.

Greta had 66 brownies in total. Of those, 15 were eaten during the party. So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over is 66 - 15 = 51 brownies.

{The final answer is 51 brownies.}</s>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies

1. Synthetic gut: Andy needs to string 3 racquets with synthetic gut. It takes him 15 minutes to string one racquet with synthetic gut, so the time it takes to string all 3 racquets is: 3 racquets * 15 minutes per racquet = 45 minutes

2. Polyester string: Andy needs to string 5 racquets with polyester string. It takes him 22 minutes to string one racquet with polyester string, so the time it takes to string all 5 racquets is: 5 racquets * 22 minutes per racquet = 110 minutes

3. Hybrid sets: Andy needs to string 4 racquets with a hybrid set. It takes him 18 minutes to string one racquet with a hybrid set, so the time it takes to string all 4 racquets is: 4 racquets * 18 minutes per racquet = 72 minutes

Now we can find the total time it takes Andy to string all 12 racquets: 45 minutes (synthetic gut) + 110 minutes (polyester string) + 72 minutes (hybrid sets) = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes

Step 1: Calculate the area of the fence:
The length of the fence is 15 feet, and the width is 10 feet. To convert these measurements to square feet, we can multiply the length by the width:

Area = Length * Width
Area = 15 feet * 10 feet
Area = 150 square feet

Step 2: Determine how many slats are needed for each square foot of fencing:
The problem states that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing he builds. Therefore, we can find out how many slats are needed for one square foot by multiplying the number of slats per foot by the number of feet in a square foot:

Slats per square foot = Slats per foot * Feet per square foot
Slats per square foot = 2 slats/foot * 1 foot
Slats per square foot = 2 slats

Step 3: Find the total number of slats needed:
Now that we know the area of the fence and how many slats are needed for each square foot, we can find the total number of slats needed by multiplying the area of the fence by the number of slats per square foot:

Total slats = Area * Slats per square foot
Total slats = 150 square feet * 2 slats/square foot

She bought 12 boxes in total. So, the number of boxes she had after giving away boxes to her mom and sister and keeping some for herself is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes.

Step 4: Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold.
Each box contains 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = <<8*20=160>>160 oranges. {The final answer is: 160 oranges}</s>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.

Now, let's find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn enough money for the books.

1. Tyler saves $14 from his allowance.
2. Tyler earns $5 per hour.

Number of hours = Total money needed / Hourly wage = $39 / $5 = 7.8 hours

Step 2: We are also told that Jerry has 10 more cherries than Richard.

Step 3: To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we can add 10 to the number of cherries Richard has.

Step 4: We know that in total they have 60 cherries, and Robert has 30. So, the number of cherries Richard has is: 60 (total cherries) - 30 (Robert's cherries) = 30.

Step 5: Now we can find the number of cherries Jerry has: 30 (Richard's cherries) + 10 (extra cherries for Jerry) = 40.

Step 6: Finally, we can find the difference in cherries between Robert and Jerry: |Robert's cherries - Jerry's cherries| = |30 - 40| = |-10| = 10.

Since he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and he sold 15 boxes on Sunday, we can find the number of boxes sold on Saturday by:
Apple pies sold on Saturday = Apple pies sold on Sunday - 4

Step 2: Calculate Sunny's earnings for apple pies on Saturday and Sunday.
Apple pies earnings on Saturday = Number of apple pies sold * Price per apple pie
Apple pies earnings on Sunday = Number of apple pies sold * Price per apple pie

Step 3: Calculate Sunny's total earnings for gingerbread on Saturday and Sunday.
Gingerbread earnings on Saturday = Number of gingerbread boxes sold * Price per gingerbread box
Gingerbread earnings on Sunday = Number of gingerbread boxes sold * Price per gingerbread box

Step 4: Calculate Sunny's total earnings for both days.
Total earnings = Apple pies earnings on Saturday + Apple pies earnings on Sunday + Gingerbread earnings on Saturday + Gingerbread earnings on Sunday

Let's calculate the values.

Step 1:
Apple pies sold on Saturday = 15 - 4 = 11 boxes

Step 2:
Apple pies earnings on Saturday = 11 boxes * $15/box = $165
Apple pies earnings on Sunday = 15 boxes * $15/box = $225

Step 3:
Gingerbread earnings on Saturday = 10 boxes * $6/box = $60
Gingerbread earnings on Sunday = 11 boxes * $6/box = $66

Step 4:
Total earnings = $165 + $225 + $60 + $66 = $452

The final answer is that Sunny earned $452 from selling gingerbread and apple pie for two days.</s>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

Let's denote the size of Sophie's boots as S. Then the size of Charlie's boots is 5S.

The average size of their shoes would be the sum of the sizes of their shoes divided by 2.

{The average size of their shoes is [(S + 5S)/2].}

To simplify the expression, we can combine the terms with the same base, which is S:

Now, we can cancel out the S term by dividing both the numerator and denominator by S:

{The average size of their shoes is 3S/1 = 3S.}

Since we don't have a specific size for Sophie's shoes (S), we cannot provide a numerical answer for the average size of their shoe sizes. We only have a size difference equation of 5:1 between Charlie's and Sophie's shoes.

The flower bed is 111 feet long. Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between every plant, so the distance between centers of neighboring plants is 1 foot (1.5 feet - 12 inches or 15 inches converted to feet). With 17 flowers already owned, we can find out how many more flowers are needed:

Number of flowers = Total length of flower bed / Distance between centers of neighboring flowers + Previously owned flowers
Number of flowers = 111 feet / 1 foot + 17 flowers
Number of flowers = 113 flowers

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying all the flowers.
Each flower costs $6 at the store.

Total cost = Number of flowers * Cost per flower

First, let's calculate the cost of petunias and sweet potato vines in one basket:

Cost of petunias in one basket = Number of petunias * Cost of each petunia
Cost of petunias in one basket = 3 * $3.00
Cost of petunias in one basket = $9.00

Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = Number of sweet potato vines * Cost of each sweet potato vine
Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = 2 * $2.50
Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket = $5.00

Now, let's calculate the total cost of one basket:

Total cost of one basket = Cost of petunias + Cost of sweet potato vines
Total cost of one basket = $9.00 + $5.00
Total cost of one basket = $14.00

Finally, to find out how much Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by the number of baskets:

Total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets = Cost of one basket * Number of baskets
Total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets = $14.00 * 5
Total cost of filling all 5 hanging baskets = $70.00

{The final answer is $70.00}</s>","The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of roses as x.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of soil are used for planting sunflowers and carnations.

The weight of soil for sunflowers = Number of sunflowers * Weight of soil per sunflower
= 4 * 3 pounds
= 12 pounds

The weight of soil for carnations = Number of carnations * Weight of soil per carnation
= 10 * 1.5 pounds
= 15 pounds

Now, let's calculate the total weight of soil used for carnations and sunflowers:

Total weight of soil = Weight of soil for sunflowers + Weight of soil for carnations
= 12 pounds + 15 pounds
= 27 pounds

Next, let's determine the number of pounds of soil left for planting roses:

Weight of soil for roses = Weight of soil in the bag - Total weight of soil for sunflowers and carnations
= 30 pounds - 27 pounds
= 3 pounds

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, we can calculate the number of roses that can be planted:

Number of roses = Weight of soil for roses / Weight of soil per rose
= 3 pounds / 1 pound
= 3 roses

However, it seems there is a mistake in the problem statement, as the given weight of soil (30 pounds) is not sufficient to plant the stated number of sunflowers, carnations, and roses.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 * $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Determine how many shoes Jessica can buy with one month's savings.
Number of shoes = Savings for shoes / Cost per shoe
Number of shoes = $500.00 / $1,000.00 = 0.5
Since Jessica can't buy half a shoe, we'll need to save for an additional shoe.

Step 3: Calculate how many monthly savings are required to buy one extra shoe.
Additional savings for one shoe = $1,000.00 - $500.00 = $500.00

Step 4: Determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year.
Number of shoes in a year = (Monthly savings for one shoe * Number of months in a year) / Cost per shoe

Step 2: To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we need to divide the total number of shrimp by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute.

Time to peel = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp peeled per minute
Time to peel = 90 / 6
{The time it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp is 15 minutes}.

Step 3: Next, let's determine how long it takes Emily to cook 90 shrimp. We know she can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

Step 4: To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we can multiply the number of batches she needs to make (since she cooks 30 shrimp at a time), by the time it takes to cook 30 shrimp.

Number of batches = Total number of shrimp / Shrimp cooked per batch
Number of batches = 90 / 30
Number of batches = 3 batches

Time to cook = Number of batches * Time to cook 30 shrimp
Time to cook = 3 * 10 minutes

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years
2. Bill's father saw the Comet when he was X = 30 years old
3. Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was Y = 3 * X

We can find the value of Y by setting up an equation based on the information given. The time between the two observations of the Comet is 75 years for one orbit, and since Bill's observations were three orbits apart, we have:

Y = 3 * (75 + X)

1. The first plane goes to Greece in three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. Since the first plane doesn't go exclusively to either France or Greece, the number of flights to Greece plus the number of flights to France must be a multiple of three, since every third flight goes to Greece. Let's assume the first plane makes a total of x flights per day, then x/3 of them go to Greece, and x/2 - x/3 go to France (x/3 goes to Greece, x/2 - x/3 = x/2 - x/3 + x/3 - x/3 = (x-x/3)(x/2 + x/3) = x(x+1)/6 flights go to France).
2. We know that the number of trips the first plane makes to France is half the number of trips the second plane makes per day, and the second plane makes 44 trips per day. Therefore, the number of trips the first plane makes to France is 44 * 0.5 = 22.
3. From the previous assumption, x(x+1)/6 flights go to France. We know that 22 is half of plane 2's travel schedule, so 2 * 22 = 44. We can set up an equation: x(x+1)/6 = 44.
4. To find the solution to the equation x(x+1)/6 = 44, we can first find the common multiple of 2, 3, and 6. That would be 6. So we have x(x+1) = 6 * 7 * 2 = 252. Now we can solve the equation by doing x = 11, x+1 = 12, so x = 11, x+1 = 12 => x = 11.

The final answer is: The first plane takes 11 flights to France each day.</s>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.

3. Therefore, the total amount of money Adam received from his parents was $6 + $12 = $18.

However, we know that Adam spent a total of $30 on the new trousers. Since the money his parents gave him was $18, we can find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings by subtracting the amount his parents gave him from the total cost of the trousers.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the age of Wilfred as W.

1. We know that the total age of the four children is 20. So we can write the equation: Akbar (A) + Alessandro (B) + Helene (2A, since Helene is twice Akbars age) + Wilfred (W) = 20

2. Substituting the given ages of Akbar and Alessandro into the equation: 3 + 4 + 2A + W = 20

3. Solving for W, we first need to get A in terms of W. Subtracting 3 and 4 from both sides, we get 2A + W = 13. We then need to solve for A: 2A = 13 - W.

4. To find the value of W, we'll need another equation to solve for two variables. Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we know that (A + W) / 2 = Helene.

5. Substituting A from step 3, we get (A + W) / 2 = 2A / 2 + W / 2, which simplifies to A = (2 + W) / 3.

In this case, trying W = 5, we find that Helene would be 6 years old (2 * 3 + 5 = 11, then 11 / 2 = 5.5, which doesn't work. However, if we try W = 10, we get Helene = 12 years old (2 * 3 + 10 = 11, then 11 / 2 = 5.5, which we can round up to 6). So, W = 10 is a possible value.

7. Therefore, Wilfred is 10 years old.

{The final answer is: Wilfred is 10 years old.}</s>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Walter collected $500 from neighbors.
He collected $1500 from the online fund.
Total amount collected by Walter = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Step 2: Calculate the amount Walter's friend donated.
Walter's friend donated $200.

Step 3: Calculate the amount Walter's lawyer is going to contribute.
Walter's lawyer is going to contribute three times the amount everyone else has donated.

First, we need to calculate the total amount donated by Walter and his friends (excluding the lawyer's contribution):
Total amount donated by Walter and friends = $2000 (Walter's collection) + $200 (Walter's friend's contribution) = $2200

Now, we can calculate the lawyer's contribution:
Lawyer's contribution = 3 * Total amount donated by Walter and friends = 3 * $2200 = $6600

{The final answer is $6600}</s>","Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we first need to determine how many slices there are for the adults and kids.

1. We have 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are a total of 2 + 4 = 6 people in the family.
2. Each kid will get a slice that is one unit in size.
3. Each adult will get a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice. So, each adult will get a slice that is 2 units in size.
4. Since there are 6 people and each adult gets a slice that is 2 units in size, the total number of units for the adults is 2 adults * 2 units/adult = 4 units.
5. To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the number of units for the adults by the total number of units in the watermelon.
6. Let X be the total number of units in the watermelon. Then, the adults will have X/6 of the total units (since there are 6 people in total). However, they actually have 4 units because each of their slices is 2 units in size. So, we want to find the value of X such that 4 = X/6.
7. To find X, we can cross-multiply: 6 * 4 = 24. So, X = 24 units.
8. The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is (number of units for adults / total number of units) * 100%. So, each adult gets (4 units / 24 units) * 100% = 16.67% of the watermelon.

{The final answer is: each adult gets 16.67% of the watermelon.}</s>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

He has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient. So the total time spent on rounds is 9 * 20 = 180 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the time Doctor Jones spends on appointments.
He has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So the total time spent on appointments is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends working at the clinic that day.
He spends 9 hours there, so 9 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 540 minutes.

Step 4: Calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds and appointments.
Total time spent = Time on rounds + Time on appointments
Total time spent = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Step 5: Calculate the time Doctor Jones has left to update his records.
Total working time = Time at clinic + Time for records

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Total time needed: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 170 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60: 170 minutes = 2.83 hours

Since Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, she could start making the cake at a time that is 2.83 hours before 5:00 pm. Let's calculate the time:

5:00 pm - 2.83 hours = 2:13 pm (approximately)

{The latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm is around 2:13 pm.}</s>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

Let's call the number of chocolate bars in a box ""x"".

1. We know that Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and each box contains x chocolate bars. So, the number of chocolate bars Lisa sold is 3.5x.
2. We know that Peter sold 4.5 boxes and each box contains x chocolate bars. So, the number of chocolate bars Peter sold is 4.5x.
3. Together, they sold 3.5x + 4.5x = 8x chocolate bars.
4. We also know that they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, we can set up the equation 8x = 64.

                 [/INST] To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we first need to determine the number of students and sessions per week, and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

1. Number of students per week: There are 10 students, so the number of students per week is 10.

2. Number of sessions per week: Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, and each day has 2 session (assuming a session is morning and evening), the number of sessions per week is 3 days/week * 2 sessions/day = 6 sessions/week.

3. Cost per session: Each session costs $25 for the studio rental, and $1.50 per student. For 10 students, the cost per session is $25 + ($1.50 * 10) = $25 + $15 = $40.

4. Earnings per week: To find the earnings per week, we multiply the number of sessions per week by the earnings per session: $40/session * 6 sessions/week = $240/week.

5. Number of weeks in a month: There are typically 4 weeks in a month, but this assumption may vary. For the purposes of this example, we'll assume there are 4 weeks in a month.

6. Earnings per month: To find the earnings per month, we multiply the earnings per week by the number of weeks in a month: $240/week * 4 weeks/month = $960/month.

If Peter and Martha have ! totals of 64 and 56 chocolate bars respectively, how many more chocolate bars does . Peter have in each ? box than Martha?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter and Martha have as x.

First, let's find the number of boxes each has:

1. Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars he has is 4x.
2. The problem states that Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 4x = 64.

To find the value of x, we can solve for x:

x = 64 / 4
x = 16

So, each of Peter's boxes contains 16 chocolate bars.

Now, let's find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:

1. Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7x.
2. The problem states that Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation: 7x = 56.

To find the value of x, we can solve for x:

x = 56 / 7
x is approximately 8.06

However, since Martha has boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, she cannot have a fraction of a chocolate bar in one box. Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes should be an integer value.

We can check if x = 8 is a feasible solution:

1. If each of Martha's boxes contains 8 chocolate bars, then the total number of chocolate bars she has is 7 * 8 = 56.

So, the discrepancy in the number of chocolate bars between Peter and Martha's boxes is:

1. Peter's boxes have 16 chocolate bars each, and he has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars he has is 16 * 4 = 64.
2. Martha's boxes have 8 chocolate bars each, and she has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is 8 * 7 = 56.
3. The difference in the number of chocolate bars they have is 64 (Peter's) - 56 (Martha's) = 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. {The final answer is 8}.</s>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box

1. We know that there are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red. So, we can find the number of blue sticks by: Blue sticks = Red sticks + 5 => Blue sticks = 9 + 5 => Blue sticks = 14
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, Yellow sticks = Blue sticks - 3 => Yellow sticks = 14 - 3 => Yellow sticks = 11

Therefore, the friends have 9 red sticks + 14 blue sticks + 11 yellow sticks = {24 sticks in total}.

The final answer is: 24 sticks.</s>","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.

                 [/INST] To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first need to find out how many miles each of them drove.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Matteo traveled.
Matteo travels at a speed of 55 miles per hour, and he travels for 4 hours. The formula for calculating distance is: distance = speed * time. So, Matteo's distance is: 55 mph * 4 hours = 220 miles.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Shandy traveled.
Shandy travels at a speed of 45 miles per hour, and she travels for 10 hours. So, Shandy's distance is: 45 mph * 10 hours = 450 miles.

Step 3: Determine the difference in miles driven between Shandy and Matteo.
To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance. So, the difference is: 450 miles (Shandy's distance) - 220 miles (Matteo's distance) = 230 miles.

{The final answer is: Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.}</s>","Matteo = 55 * 4 = <<55*4=220>>220 miles

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, and one-half of the students under 16 are male. In ; total, how many female students are enrolled at this school?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem into steps:

Step 1: Find the number of students over 16 years old.
 Half of the students are over 16 years old, so there are 3000 * 0.5 = 1500 students in this category.

Step 2: Find the number of male students over 16 years old.
 One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 * 0.25 = 375 male students in this category.

Step 3: Find the number of female students over 16 years old.
 Since we know the number of male students over 16, we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students over 16. So, there are 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16 years old.

Step 4: Find the number of students under 16 years old.
 We know that half of the students are under 16 years old, so there are 3000 * 0.5 = 1500 students in this category.

Step 5: Find the number of male students under 16 years old.
 One-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 * 0.5 = 750 male students in this category.

Step 6: Find the number of female students under 16 years old.
 Since we know the number of male students under 16, we can find the number of female students by subtracting the number of male students from the total number of students under 16. So, there are 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16 years old.

Step 7: Find the total number of female students in the school.
 We have found the number of female students in both age categories, so the total number of female students in the school is 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875.

First, let's find the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B on each day.

On the first day:
- Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity: 18000 gallons * 1/4 = 4500 gallons
- Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda: 4500 gallons * 3/4 = 3375 gallons
- Total water pumped on the first day: 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons

On the second day:
- Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day: 4500 gallons * 2/3 = 5333.33 gallons (rounded to nearest gallon)
- Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day: 3375 gallons * 1/3 = 1125 gallons
- Total water pumped on the second day: 5333 + 1125 = 6458 gallons

Now, let's find the total amount of water pumped over the two days and calculate how many gallons are remaining for the tank to be full.

Total water pumped in two days: 7875 gallons (Day 1) + 6458 gallons (Day 2) = 14,333 gallons

Tank capacity: 18000 gallons

Remaining water: 18000 gallons (tank capacity) - 14,333 gallons (water pumped) = 3667 gallons

The final answer is: 3667 gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full.</s>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.

They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons

In , the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge ? of the power bank when Maria went ; out to the park?
                 [/INST] To find the charge percentage of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to determine the total charging time and the charging efficiency during each phase. Let's break this problem into steps:

Step 1: First, let's find the total charging time for the power bank to lose 28% of its capacity during the two different charging rates. Since the power bank lost 28% of its capacity in total, we can find the percentage of capacity lost at each rate and then add them together.

When the power bank was losing 9% of capacity each hour:
Let x be the number of hours it took to lose 28% of the capacity when losing 9% per hour. So, 9% * x = 28%. Solving for x, we get x = 28 / 0.09 = 31.11 hours. Since we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we'll round up this time to 32 hours.

When the power bank was losing 7% of capacity each hour for 3 hours:
Let y be the number of hours it took to lose 28% of the capacity during the 3 hours with a 7% loss per hour. Since this was a constant rate over 3 hours, we know that 7% * y * 3 = 28%. Solving for y, we get y = 28 / (0.07 * 3) = 13.29 hours. Since we cannot have a fraction of an hour, we'll round up this time to 14 hours.

Step 2: Now that we have the total charging time for both phases, we can find the total charge that was put into the power bank during this time by knowing the charge rate is decreasing at a rate of 9% per hour when fully depleted and 7% per hour when in this second phase. Let's assume the power bank was fully depleted at the start.

The charge remaining after charging for 32 hours at a 9% loss per hour is 72%. So, the power bank was charged up to 100% + 72% = 172% of its capacity during the first phase. However, since we can't have more than 100% of the capacity, this indicates that the power bank started with a partial charge of 1 - (100 / 172) = 0.5878 or approximately 58.78% charge.

During the second phase, the power bank was charged for 14 hours, losing 7% of its capacity each hour. Therefore, it gained (100 - 7%) * 14 = 93.6% of its capacity during this second phase. In total, the power bank was charged to a capacity of 58.78 + 93.6 = 152.48%. Again, since we can't have more than 100% of the capacity, this indicates that an error has occurred in the question, and the charging rates do not add up to a realistic scenario.

However, if we assume the power bank had a full charge at the start (100%), we can use this information to find the charging time when Maria went to the park.

Step 3: Since the power bank was fully depleted after 32 hours of losing 9% of the capacity per hour and gained 93.6% of its capacity during the second phase, this means that the total charging duration was 32 hours + (the duration for the second phase). To find the duration of the second phase, we can set up the equation 7% * (seconds_in_seconds_during_the_second_phase) * 3 = 28% * total_capacity, where total_capacity is the capacity of the power bank. Solving this equation and simplifying, we find that the duration of the second phase was 3 hours. Hence, the total charging duration was 32 hours + 3 hours = 35 hours. Since we started charging 5 hours before going to the park, the charging duration when Maria went to the park was 30 hours (35 hours - 5 hours).

Since Maria started charging with a full charge, she depleted her power bank and charged it back up 30 hours later. Therefore, the percentage of charge when Maria went to the park was 100%.

{The final answer is: Maria went out to the park with a fully charged power bank (","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                 [/INST] To find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, we first need to determine how much money she saves per week from both wages and tips.

1. Calculate Janet's weekly earnings from wages:
   Janet works 40 hours a week and makes $10 an hour, so her weekly wage earnings are:
   Weekly wage = Hours worked per week * Hourly wage
   Weekly wage = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

2. Next, calculate her weekly earnings from tips. However, we don't have enough information to determine her average tip income per hour or per customer, so we can't directly calculate her weekly tip earnings.

3. The question asks for how many weeks she needs to work to save up 20% of the car's cost, so we'll assume that Janet saves all her wages for the down payment and find out how long it takes to reach that goal. If she earns $400 per week from wages, we can calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000 (20% of $10000) as follows:

4. Weeks to save down payment = Total amount to save / Weekly savings
   Weeks to save down payment = $2000 / $400
   Weeks to save down payment = 5 weeks

So, {The final answer is: Janet needs to work for 5 weeks to save up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car.}

This answer assumes that Janet saves all her wages and doesn't include any tips. If Janet's tips significantly increase her weekly earnings, she may be able to reach her savings goal faster than 5 weeks.</s>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

Peaches: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
Pears: 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
Kiwis: 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
Apples: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Total spent on fruits: $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

However, Jamaar only has $10. So, he hasn't been able to buy all the fruits he wants with the money he earned.

The difference between what Jamaar has and what he wants to spend is $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75. This means Jamaar has enough left to buy plums worth $0.75.

Since each plum costs $0.25, Jamaar can buy: $0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums.

(Round ; to the nearest integer)
                 [/INST] Step 1: We're given the initial price of carrots ($120) and the rate of increase per year (5%). To find the price after one year, we'll first calculate the increase in price:

Price Increase = Initial Price * Increase Rate
Price Increase = $120 * 0.05
Price Increase = $6

Step 2: Add the price increase to the initial price to find the price after one year:

Price after 1 year = Initial Price + Price Increase
Price after 1 year = $120 + $6
Price after 1 year = $126

Step 3: Repeat this process for the second and third years:

Price Increase for each year = Initial Price * Increase Rate
Price Increase for each year = $126 * 0.05
Price Increase for year 2 = $6.30 (rounding to the nearest ten cents due to decimal places in the calculation)
Price Increase for year 3 = $6.30 (applying the same calculation)

Step 4: Add the price increase for each year to the price at the beginning of that year to find the price at the end of the year:

Price after 2 years = Price after 1 year + Price Increase for year 2
Price after 2 years = $126 + $6.30

                 [/INST] Let's break down the information given in the problem and find out how many portraits and selfies Olivia has:

1. Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.
2. She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.
3.There are 3 albums with selfies (selfie albums) and 2 albums with portraits (portrait albums).

Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into each album, we'll first find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures she uploaded by the number of albums she created:

Total pictures / Number of albums = Pictures per album
72 / 8 = 9

As we know, there are 3 selfie albums and 2 portrait albums. So, let's calculate how many pictures each selfie album and each portrait album has:

Selfie albums = Number of selfie albums * Pictures per album
Selfie albums = 3 * 9 = 27 pictures per selfie album

Portrait albums = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per album
Portrait albums = 2 * 9 = 18 pictures per portrait album

Now we can find the total number of selfies and portraits:

Total selfies = Number of selfie albums * Pictures per selfie album
Total selfies = 3 * 27 = 81 selfies

Total portraits = Number of portrait albums * Pictures per portrait album
Total portraits = 2 * 18 = 36 portraits

{The final answer is: Olivia has 81 selfies and 36 portraits.}</s>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.

                 [/INST] To find the number of points Aries is sure to get, we first need to determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions.

1. Easy questions make up 40% of the total number of questions, so there are 0.4 * 60 = <|0.4*60=24.> 24 easy questions.
2. Half of the questions are average or difficult, so there are 0.6 * 60 = <|0.6*60=36.> 36 non-easy questions.
   Since there are equal numbers of average and difficult questions, there are 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Now, we can calculate the number of points Aries is sure to get for each type of question:

1. She gets 75% of the points for the easy questions, so she earns <|75*24=18.> 18 points for the easy questions.
2. She gets half of the points for the average and difficult questions. For the average questions, she earns <|50*18=9.> 9 points. For the difficult questions, she earns <|50*18=9.> 9 points.

Adding up the points for all question types, we get:

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold as ""x"". Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 2x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal, so the price of a large stuffed animal is $12 when the price of a small stuffed animal is $4.

We can set up an equation to solve for x:

4*2x + 12x = 120

Simplifying the equation:

16x + 12x = 120
28x = 120
x = 120 / 28

Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals, x = 4.21 (approximately). However, since Teresa sells whole stuffed animals, this result is not valid.

1. We know that the Smith twins found 30 eggs each, so they found a total of 30 + 30 = <<30+30=60>>60 eggs.
2. The problem states that ""all the other eggs except ?10 were found by their friends."" It doesn't specify how many eggs the friends found.

4. We also know that 10 eggs were not found by the Smith twins or their friends, so those 10 eggs are still hidden.
5. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is the total number of eggs hidden minus the eggs found by the Smith twins minus the eggs still hidden: 100 - 60 - 10 = <<100-60-10=30>>30 eggs.

With a bare hand, one dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day. With an iron pickaxe, one dwarf mines 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds per day.

A 50% increase in mining output means multiplying the number of pounds mined with an iron pickaxe by 1.5 (since 100% + 50% = 150%, or 1.5 times the original). Therefore, one dwarf mines 24 * 1.5 = <<24*1.5=36>>36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, we want to find out how many pounds 40 dwarves mine in a month with 30 days, each using a steel pickaxe. First, let's calculate their daily mining output: 36 pounds per dwarf per day.

The combined daily mining output of 40 dwarves is 36 * 40 = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds of ore.

To find their monthly mining output, we need to multiply the daily mining output by the number of days in a month: 1440 * 30 = <<1440*30=43200>>43,200 pounds of ore.

For the first package:
Price ratio_1 = $3 / 2
Price ratio_1 = $1.5

For the second package:
Price ratio_2 = $6 / 4
Price ratio_2 = $1.5

Since both ratios are equal ($1.5), we can determine that each sandwich costs $1.5 in this system. Now, let's find the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches.

1. Tom bought the new bedroom set for $3000.
2. He sold his old bedroom for $1000 and used that money to pay part of the new set's cost.
3. So, Tom paid $3000 (new set's cost) - $1000 (money from old set's sale) = $2900 for the new bedroom set.

Now, we'll calculate how much Tom owes monthly for the remaining balance.

Since Tom paid $2900 upfront and now has to pay 10% monthly interest, we can use the formula for calculating monthly payments for a loan:

Monthly payment = Loan amount * (Interest rate / 12)

First, we need to convert the annual interest rate (10%) into a decimal format: 10% = 0.1.

Now, let's find the monthly payment:
Monthly payment = $2900 * (0.1 / 12) = $2900 * 0.00833333 = $238.50 {approximately}

                    question:
                    As Sally walked to school, she was holding the strings to 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 ? yellow balloons. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused 40% ; of the red balloons to burst.  The shockingly loud : sound startled Sally, and . she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons.  But as she neared the school grounds, she found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree, and she added 75% of them to her remaining ; clutch of ? balloons, which she carried into , the school.  What number of balloons did she finally ! carry into the school?
                 [/INST] To find the number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of each type of balloon remaining after the events described in the problem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and x yellow balloons.
2. Forty percent of the red balloons burst, so 25 * 0.4 = 10 red balloons burst. Therefore, Sally had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.
3. She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Since she had x yellow balloons, 0.5x balloons were released. But since she released half, she had x - 0.5x = 0.5x balloons left.
4. She found 8 blue balloons caught in a tree and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons. So, she had 0.75 * 8 + 15 + 0.5x balloons after adding the blue balloons.

To find the value of x, we need to check if the number of balloons Sally had after all events is reasonable. Let's calculate:

0.75 * 8 + 15 + 0.5x = total number of balloons
6.4 + 15 + 0.5x = total number of balloons
11.4 + 0.5x = total number of balloons

If x = 12, she would have had 11.4 + 0.5 * 12 = 16.2, which is not a reasonable number of balloons. Let's try x = 24 instead.

11.4 + 0.5 * 24 = 15 + 12 = 27 balloons

So, the final answer is: {Sally carried 27 balloons into the school}.</s>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                    Marcus is trying to ! decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.

Even : if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal ! extension. ! What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
                 [/INST] To find the percentage chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to calculate the probability that neither of the three events (substitute teacher, extension for everyone, or personal extension for Marcus) occurs.

1. The probability that a substitute teacher doesn't come is 50% (100% - 50%).
2. Given that a normal teacher comes, the probability that everyone gets an extension is 40%.
3. Given that no one gets an extension, the probability that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and gets a personal extension is 20%.

To find the probability that none of these events occur, we can use the formula for the probability of the intersection of two or more events:

P(A and B and C) = P(A) * P(B | A) * P(C | A and B)

In our case, A = Substitute teacher doesn't come, B = No extension for everyone, C = Marcus gets a personal extension

1. P(A) = Probability of no substitute teacher = 50%
2. Given A, P(B) = Probability of no extension for everyone | Substitute teacher doesn't come = 60% (100% - 40%)
3. Given A and B, P(C) = Probability of Marcus getting a personal extension | Substitute teacher doesn't come and No extension for everyone = 80% (20% + 60% = 80%)

Now we can calculate the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework, which is the opposite of the event we're interested in:

P(Marcus turns in his homework) = 1 - P(No substitute teacher and No extension for everyone and Marcus gets a personal extension)
P(Marcus turns in his homework) = 1 - (P(A) * P(B | A) * P(C | A and B))

Substituting the values we found for A, B, and C:

P(Marcus turns in his homework) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.4 * 0.2)
P(Marcus turns in his homework) = 1 - 0.4
P(Marcus turns in his homework) = 0.6

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 60%. {The final answer is 60%}.</s>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24

                 [/INST] To find out how many tickets each graduate would receive, we first need to determine the total number of seats available for guests.

Total seating capacity = Seats for graduates + Seats for faculty + Seats for guests

Given that there are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, the number of seats for guests is:

Seats for guests = Total seating capacity - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty
Seats for guests = 6000 - 950 - 300
Seats for guests = 5150

Now that we know there are 5150 seats for guests, we can find out how many tickets each graduate would receive by dividing the total number of seats for guests by the number of graduates:

Tickets per graduate = Seats for guests / Number of graduates
Tickets per graduate = 5150 / 950
Tickets per graduate ≈ 5.43

 Since each graduate can't have a fraction of a ticket, the number of tickets each graduate would receive is approximately rounded down to account for the difference in the number of graduates and the total number of seats for guests.

The final answer is: Each graduate would receive approximately 5 tickets.</s>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.

Let's denote the number of medium-sized beans as x.
We know that x = 2 * 75 = 150.

Next, we need to find the number of small jelly beans that is equivalent to one medium-sized bean.

3. We're told that eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.

Let's denote the number of small beans as y.
We know that y = 3.

Now we can find the total number of small jelly beans that Grandpa can eat:

4. To eat the same amount as 1 medium-sized bean, Grandpa needs to eat y small beans:

Total small beans =Number of medium-sized beans * Small beans per medium-sized bean

Total small beans = 150 * 3

Total small beans = 450

                 [/INST] To find out Melissa's hourly pay after expenses, follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of jury pay Melissa received.
Total jury pay = Jury pay per day * Number of days
Total jury pay = $15/day * 3 days
Total jury pay = $45

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Melissa paid for parking.
Total parking expenses = Parking fee per day * Number of days
Total parking expenses = $3/day * 3 days
Total parking expenses = $9

Step 3: Subtract the total parking expenses from the total jury pay to find out Melissa's net jury pay.
Net jury pay = Total jury pay - Total parking expenses
Net jury pay = $45 - $9
Net jury pay = $36

Step 4: Divide the net jury pay by the total number of hours Melissa worked to find out her hourly rate.
Hourly rate = Net jury pay / Total number of hours
Total number of hours = Days * Hours per day
Total number of hours = 3 days * 6 hours
Total number of hours = 18 hours

Hourly rate = $36 / 18 hours

{The final answer is: Melissa earns approximately $2.00 per hour after expenses.}

Note: Since the hourly rate calculated is an approximation (it is not the exact hourly rate because of rounding), the final answer could be expressed as ""{Approximately $2.00 per hour}"".

                 [/INST] To find out how long it would take Jim to earn enough money to pay off his loans and cover the lost income while in college, we need to calculate the total amount of money he needs to make and then determine how long it would take him to earn that amount with his increased income.

First, let's find the total amount of loans Jim accumulated during his college years:

Loans = Loans per year * Number of years

Loans = $50,000/year * 4 years

Loans = $200,000

Now, let's calculate the lost income while Jim was in college. Since he had a $25,000/year job before college, the amount of lost income while in college for 4 years is:

Lost Income = $25,000/year * 4 years

Lost Income = $100,000

Next, we need to calculate Jim's new income after college, which is three times his old income:

New Income = Old Income * 3

New Income = $25,000/year * 3

New Income = $75,000/year

To find out how long it would take Jim to earn enough money to pay off the loans and the lost income, we can set up an equation:

Total amount of money needed = Loans + Lost Income

Total amount of money needed = $200,000 + $100,000

Total amount of money needed = $300,000

Now, we can determine how long it would take Jim to earn this amount with his new income of $75,000/year:

Time to earn enough money = Total amount of money needed / New Income

Time to earn enough money = $300,000 / $75,000/year

Time to earn enough money = 4 years

Therefore, Jim would need to work for an additional 4 years after college to earn enough money to pay off the loans and cover the lost income.

{The final answer is: Jim would need to work for an additional 4 years to earn enough money to pay off the loans and cover the lost income.}</s>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000

3. Hence, the dimension of the required fabric pieces will be: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet long, and 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet wide.

Now, to calculate the area of one fabric piece, we need to find the square footage:

1. Area of one fabric piece = Length * Width
2. Area of one fabric piece = 8 feet * 10 feet
3. Area of one fabric piece = 80 square feet

Since Jim needs two fabric pieces, the total square footage required will be:

1. Total square footage required = 2 * Area of one fabric piece
2. Total square footage required = 2 * 80 square feet
3. Total square footage required = 160 square feet.

{The final answer is Jim needs 160 square feet of fabric to make a comforter for his king-sized bed.}</s>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday. We can write this as:
Letters delivered on Tuesday = Letters delivered on Monday * (1/5 + 0.17)

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
Letters delivered on Tuesday = 425 * (1/5 + 0.17)
Letters delivered on Tuesday = 425 * (0.2 + 0.17)
Letters delivered on Tuesday = 425 * 0.37
Letters delivered on Tuesday ≈ 158.635 Letters
Since the post office cannot deliver a fraction of a letter, we'll round this number down to the nearest whole number.
So, Letters delivered on Tuesday = 158

Step 3: Find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday.
Letters delivered on Wednesday = 2 * Letters delivered on Tuesday + 5
Letters delivered on Wednesday = 2 * 158 + 5
Letters delivered on Wednesday = 316 + 5
Letters delivered on Wednesday = 321

Step 4: Find the total number of letters delivered Monday - Wednesday.
Total letters delivered = Letters delivered on Monday + Letters delivered on Tuesday + Letters delivered on Wednesday
Total letters delivered = 425 + 158 + 321
Total letters delivered = 904

                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount Johnny's dad lost on the first race as X. Then, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost on the first race in the second race, so the amount he won in the second race is 2X+1. In the third race, he lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race, so the amount he lost in the third race is 1.5(2X+1).

Since Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race and won more than twice the amount he lost on the second race, we can assume that 2X+1 > 5. Also, since he lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the third race, we have 1.5(2X+1) < 0.

To find out how much he lost on average that day, we need to find the sum of all the money he lost and divide it by the number of races he participated in. That is:

Sum of losses = X + (2X+1) + 1.5(2X+1)

Now we have the equation: 3X + 2X + 1 + 3X + (1.5)\*(2X+1) = 0.

Simplifying this equation, we have: 6X + 1 + 3X + 3X+(3X+1.5) = 0, which gives us 12X + 5 = 0. From this, we can find X = -5/12.

1. Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we have Xavier's height in inches: Xavier = 4 * 12 = 48 inches.
 over the summer, he grew by 3 inches, so:
 New height of Xavier = 48 + 3 = 51 inches

2. Cole was 50 inches tall. After growing 2 inches, his new height is:
 New height of Cole = 50 + 2 = 52 inches

Now, we can find the difference between their new heights:
Difference = New height of Cole - New height of Xavier
Difference = 52 inches - 51 inches
Difference = 1 inch

{The final answer is: The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.}</s>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.

                    A team of 4 painters worked on , a mansion : for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks. How many hours of work did each painter put in?
                 [/INST] To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, let's go through the following steps:

1. First, let's find out how many days there are in 3 weeks. We know that:
   - 1 week = 7 days
   - 3 weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days

2. The team of 4 painters worked on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day, which is the same as working for 3/8 hours (since there are 24 hours in a day).

3. To find out how many hours each painter worked in one day, we simply multiply the total hours they worked in a day by the number of painters:
   
   Hours worked by 1 painter in one day = (3/8) hours × 4 painters = 12/8 hours

4. Now, we need to convert the mixed number 12/8 into an improper fraction and simplify it. An improper fraction is a fraction with a numerator that is greater than or equal to its denominator:

   - In this case, we have a larger numerator (12) compared to the denominator (8).

5. To convert a mixed number (1 1/8) to an improper fraction, we first multiply the whole number (1) by the denominator (8), then add the numerator (1):
   
   - 1 × 8 = 8
   - 8 + 1 = 9

6. So, the improper fraction form of 1 1/8 is 9/8.

7. Now, we can find the total hours of work done by all 4 painters in one day by multiplying the hours each painter worked in one day (9/8 hours) by the total number of days they worked (21 days):

   Total hours of work by all 4 painters = 9/8 hours/painter × 21 days = 45 × 9/8 = 45 × (3/4) = 135/2 hours

8. To get the hours worked by each painter individually, we divide the total hours of work by the total number of painters:

   Hours worked by 1 painter = Total hours of work / Number of painters = 135/2 hours / 4 painters = 33.75 hours

In the . third set, he retrieved half : as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis . balls . in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of tennis balls that Rory retrieved in the second set as x.

From the problem, we know that:

1. In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 tennis balls.
2. In the third set, he retrieved x/2 tennis balls.
3. The total number of tennis balls he retrieved was x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 3x/2 + 2x + 4

We also know that the total number of tennis balls was 19. So, we can set up the equation:

3x/2 + 2x + 4 = 19

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we have:

3x + 4x + 8 = 38

Combining the terms, we get:

7x + 8 = 38

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get:

7x = 30

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 30/7 ≈ 4.29

Since it's not possible to retrieve a fraction of a tennis ball, there's a mistake in the problem or the given data doesn't make sense. In this case, the final answer is undefined or unobtainable.

However, assuming the second set had an exact multiple of 4 tennis balls more than the first set, we could try approximating a value for x. In this example, we could consider that Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second, which is equivalent to x + 4 = 1.5x. Solving this equation for x gives x = 4. This would mean that in the second set, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls (2x = 20), making the total 20 + 9 = 29 tennis balls, which is also an impossible number.

Therefore, this problem contains conflicting information and does not have a valid answer.</s>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the annual depreciation rate. The problem states that the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Step 2: Calculate the annual depreciation amount. To find the annual depreciation amount, multiply the car's initial cost ($20000) and the depreciation rate (0.21).

Annual depreciation amount = Initial cost * Depreciation rate
Annual depreciation amount = $20000 * 0.21
Annual depreciation amount = $4200

Step 3: Determine the car's value in 2008. To find the car's value in 2008, subtract the first year's depreciation from the initial cost.

Car value in 2008 = Initial cost - (Annual depreciation amount * Number of years)
Car value in 2008 = $20000 - ($4200 * 1)
Car value in 2008 = $15780

Step 4: Calculate the car's value in 2009. Similarly, subtract the second year's depreciation from the car's value in 2008.

Car value in 2009 = Car value in 2008 - (Annual depreciation amount * Number of years)
Car value in 2009 = $15780 - ($4200 * 1)
Car value in 2009 = $11580

Step 5: Calculate the car's value in 2010. Subtract the third year's depreciation from the car's value in 2009.

Car value in 2010 = Car value in 2009 - (Annual depreciation amount * Number of years)
Car value in 2010 = $11580 - ($4200 * 1)
Car value in 2010 = $7380

We are given that it is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego to New York City. So, to find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we simply subtract the number of kilometers she has already covered from the total distance to New York City.

Remaining Distance = Total Distance to New York City - Distance Already Covered
Remaining Distance = 1955 km - 1300 km
Remaining Distance = 655 km

{The final answer is Bernice needs to drive approximately 655 kilometers to reach New York City from San Diego.}</s>","325 * 4 = <<325*4=1300>>1300 km
1955 - 1300 = <<1955-1300=655>>655 km

1. Initially, Romeo boards the train with 120 people.
2. At the first stop, 20 more people board, so there are now 120 + 20 = 140 people on the train.
3. At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, so there are now 140 - 50 = 90 people on the train.
4. At the second stop, twice the number of people that descended boarded the train, which means there were 50 * 2 = 100 new people. Thus, there are now 90 + 100 = 190 people on the train.
5. At the third stop, 80 more people descended from the train, so there are now 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.

Step 2: Calculate the final number of people on the train.
The problem has asked for the number of people on the train at the final stop, but it hasn't explicitly stated that the third station is the final station. Therefore, we need to check if there are any more stops after the third station. With the given information, it appears that the third stop is indeed the final stop, so we have the answer.

However, 50*2 = <<50*2=100>>100 more people boarded the train.
After the second stop, the total number of people was 90+100 =<<90+100=190>>190
At the third stop, the number of people on the train decreased to 190-80 = <<190-80=110>>110 who reached the final stop.

Step 1: Determine the number of tiles required.
Given:
- Area of the kitchen floor = 200 sqft
- Each tile side length = 1 ft

To find the number of tiles, we divide the total area by the area of each tile.
Area of one tile = side length ^ 2
Area of one tile = 1 ft ^ 2 = 1 sqft

So, the number of tiles required is:
200 sqft / 1 sqft/ tile = 200 tiles

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of renovating the floor.
Given:
- Number of tiles = 200
- Cost per tile = $12

Total cost of renovating the floor is:
Cost = number of tiles * cost per tile
Cost = 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400

Step 1: Calculate the cost of insurance a month with the surcharge.
Cost of insurance a month with surcharge = Normal cost + (Normal cost * Surcharge percentage)
Cost of insurance a month with surcharge = $120 + ($120 * 0.6)
Cost of insurance a month with surcharge = $120 + $72
Cost of insurance a month with surcharge = $192

Step 2: Calculate the cost of insurance a year.
Cost of insurance a year = Cost of insurance a month * 12 months
Cost of insurance a year = $192 * 12
Cost of insurance a year = $2,268

                 [/INST] To find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we first need to determine how many loads are required to wash all the sheets for one week.

1. Greg puts clean sheets on 5 beds (4 twin beds and 1 king size bed), so he needs to wash that many sets of sheets per week.
2. He has 4 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets.
3. The laundry machine can wash 2 sets of twin sheets and 1 set of king sheets at a time.

To find out how many loads of laundry are needed to wash all the sheets for one week, we simply divide the number of sets of sheets he has by the number of sets of sheets that can be washed in one load.

Loads for twin sheets: 4 sets * (2 sets/load) = 8 loads
Loads for king sheet: 1 set * (1 set/load) = 1 load

The total number of loads for one week is the sum of the loads for twin and king sheets:

Total loads for one week = 8 loads (twin) + 1 load (king) = 9 loads

Now we need to find out how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year. We know that there are 52 weeks in a year.

Total loads for one year = Loads per week * 52 weeks
Total loads for one year = 9 loads/week * 52 weeks = 468 loads.

Step 1: Find out how much cat food is consumed in one day by all three cats.
Imma feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each feeding. Since there are three cats, the total amount of cat food consumed in one day is:
60 grams/cat × 2 feedings/day × 3 cats = 360 grams of cat food/day

Step 2: Calculate how many days 720 grams of cat food will last.
To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by their daily consumption:
720 grams/total cat food ÷ 360 grams/day = 2 days

However, since we calculated the daily consumption for two feedings, we need to multiply the result by 1.5 to account for the three feedings that occur each day:
2 days × 1.5 = 3 days

The final answer is: 720 grams of cat food will last for 3 days.</s>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.

Step 2: We're told that Becky ate 10 slices. We don't know yet how many slices Jake and Silvia ate, but we can find the difference in the number of slices Becky and Jake ate:
Becky: 10 slices
Jake: x slices
Difference: (Becky's slices) - (Jake's slices) = 3 (since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake)

Step 3: We can use the difference in slices to find the number of slices Jake ate:
Jake's slices: (Becky's slices) - (difference) = 10 - 3 = 7 slices

Step 4: We're also told that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, we can find the number of slices Silvia ate:
Silvia's slices: 2 * (Jake's slices) = 2 * 7 = 14 slices

Step 5: To find the total number of slices they all ate, we simply add the number of slices for each person:

We know that Betsy's part takes 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so the length of Betsy's part is ""d + 18"" minutes.

The meal was made in 98 minutes in total, so we can write the equation: d + (d + 18) = 98

Now, let's solve this equation for ""d"":

Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: 2d + 18 = 98

Step 2: Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with the variable: 2d = 80

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the value of d: d = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.

To find the length of Betsy's part, we add the 18 minutes difference: Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = {The final answer is 58 minutes}</s>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes

=> = 80 emails/day × 5 days = 400 emails

Step 2: Find out how many emails James responds to daily.
Emails requiring response = Total emails - Emails not requiring response
=> Percentage of emails requiring response = 100% - 20% = 80%
=> Number of emails requiring response = Total emails × Percentage of emails requiring response
=> = 80 emails/day × 80% = 64 emails/day

Step 3: Find out how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week.

So, they have 20 - 14 = <<20-14=6>>6 pizzas left.

Step 2: The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas.
They consumed 40 pizzas * 0.8 = <<40*0.8=32>>32 pizzas.

Step 3: Therefore, the amount of pizzas left in total is the pizzas the glee club have left + the pizzas the football team have left.
We know that the glee club have 6 pizzas left, but the problem doesn't tell us how many pizzas the football team have left. So, since we don't have enough information to determine an exact answer, we cannot provide a definite numerical final answer.

However, we can make a general statement about the situation: Since the glee club consumed fewer pizzas than they ordered, and the football team consumed more pizzas than they ordered, the total number of pizzas left is likely to be greater than the number of pizzas the glee club ordered, but less than twice the number of pizzas the glee club and football team ordered combined.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons. He wants to send twice as many big coupons, so:
Number of big coupons = 2 * Number of small coupons
Number of big coupons = 2 * 700
Number of big coupons = 1400

Step 2: Calculate the cost of mailing each type of coupon.
Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents:
Cost of mailing one small coupon = 5 cents
Cost of mailing one big coupon = 15 cents

Step 3: Calculate the cost of mailing all the small and big coupons.
Cost of mailing all small coupons = Number of small coupons * Cost of mailing one small coupon
Cost of mailing all small coupons = 700 * 5 cents
Cost of mailing all small coupons = $35

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
According to the problem, a quarter of the number of trucks dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures. So, we need to find 25% of the total number of trucks.
20 trucks * 25% = 5 trucks {There are 5 trucks that had mechanical failures}

Step 2: Find the amount of fertiliser each truck carries in tons.
Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser.

Step 3: Find the total amount of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers (from trucks with mechanical failures).
Since there are 5 trucks that had mechanical failures, and each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers is:
5 trucks * 20 tons = 100 tons {100 tons of fertiliser did not reach the farmers}

Step 4: Find the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
The problem states that there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that was dispatched for delivery is:
20 trucks * 20 tons = 400 tons {The total amount of fertiliser that was dispatched for delivery}

Step 5: Find the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.
To find the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to subtract the amount of fertiliser that did not reach the farmers from the total amount of fertiliser that was dispatched for delivery.
400 tons (total amount of fertiliser dispatched) - 100 tons (fertiliser that did not reach farmers) = 300 tons {The final answer: 300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers that day}</s>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

- So for 6 dozen croissants, he will need 6 * 12 = <6*12=72>72 ounces (or 4.5 pounds, since there are 16 ounces in a pound) of butter.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 4.5 pounds of butter at $4.00 per pound.
- 4.5 pounds * $4.00/pound = $18.00

Step 3: Find out how much 6 pounds of butter would cost under the promotion.
- Since the promotion offers half off for one pound of butter, the discounted price for one pound of butter is $2.00/pound.
- So for 6 pounds of butter, the cost would be 6 * $2.00/pound = $12.00

Step 4: Subtract the discount from the original cost to find the cost of 6 pounds of butter without the promotion.
- Original cost of 4.5 pounds of butter = $18.00
- Discounted cost of 6 pounds of butter = $12.00
- To find the cost of 6 pounds of butter without the promotion, we can use the following equation:
  Original Cost - Discount = Cost Without Promotion
  $18.00 - $12.00 = $6.00

The final answer is that it will cost Dennis $6.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter without the promotion.</s>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter

1. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, so she has X - (X/4) = 3X/4 left.
2. Riza spent one-third of her money, so she has Y - (Y/3) = 3Y/4 left.
3. We know that each of them had $60 initially. So, X + Y = 2 * $60 = $120.
4. Substitute X = $120 - Y into Maggie's equation: 3X/4 = 3 * ($120 - Y) / 4.
5. Simplify: 3$120/4 - 3Y/4 = $360/4.
6. Solve for Y: 3$120 - 3Y = $360.
7. Subtract $120 from both sides: 2$120 = 3Y.
8. Divide both sides by 2: Y = 2$120 / 3 = $240.
9. Now we have Maggie's money: X = $120 - Y = $120 - $240 = -$120.

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many bananas one monkey (monkey 1) eats in a day, and then we'll calculate the number of bananas for the other two monkeys, including monkey 3.

One monkey (monkey 1) eats 10 bananas each day.

Now let's find out how many bananas the second monkey eats each day. According to the problem statement, the second monkey eats ""4 more bananas than the first monkey,"" so we have:

Bananas for Monkey 2 = Bananas for Monkey 1 + 4
Bananas for Monkey 2 = 10 bananas + 4
Bananas for Monkey 2 = 14 bananas

Since Mr. Robles buys enough bananas to feed all three monkeys for one week, we can calculate the total number of bananas needed for one week first, and then divide this by the number of days in a week to find the daily requirement.

Total bananas for one week = Bananas for one monkey in a week * Number of monkeys
Total bananas for one week = 315 bananas * 3
Total bananas for one week = 945 bananas

Now, let's find out the number of bananas for one day in a week.

Bananas for one day = Total bananas for one week / Number of days in a week
Bananas for one day = 945 bananas / 7 days
Bananas for one day ≈ 135 bananas

Now we have the daily banana requirement for all three monkeys combined. We already know that Monkey 1 eats 10 bananas and Monkey 2 eats 14 bananas. So, we need to find out how many bananas Monkey 3 eats each day.

Total bananas for all monkeys each day = Bananas for Monkey 1 + Bananas for Monkey 2
Total bananas for all monkeys each day = 10 bananas + 14 bananas
Total bananas for all monkeys each day = 24 bananas

Now we know that there are 24 bananas for all three monkeys each day. Since we already found that there are approximately 135 bananas in total for one day, we can calculate how many bananas Monkey 3 eats:

Bananas for Monkey 3 = Total bananas for all monkeys each day - Bananas for Monkey 1 - Bananas for Monkey 2
Bananas for Monkey 3 = 24 bananas - 10 bananas - 14 bananas
Bananas for Monkey 3 = 0 bananas

There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement, as it implies that the given amount of bananas is enough for all three monkeys for a week, but the calculation shows that there are not enough bananas for all three monkeys each day. Additionally, the result for bananas for Monkey 3 seems incorrect. This problem might have an error, or some important information might be missing.

{The final answer is not provided as the problem appears to have inconsistent information, and further clarification would be required to reach a correct conclusion.}</s>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.

Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.
So, her total collection = Saved toothpicks = 10 (toothpicks per week) × 12 (weeks) = 120 toothpicks

Step 2: Determine how many more toothpicks Melanie needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks.
Goal toothpicks = 200
Toothpicks Melanie has = 120
So, toothpicks needed to collect = Goal toothpicks - Toothpicks Melanie has = 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks if she continues saving at her current rate.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price, we need to find the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch and then the price his friend paid. Then we can find the percentage discount by determining how much less the price his friend paid was compared to the original price.

Step 1: Mr. Rogers paid for the watch
Since he bought the watch at 75% of its original price:
Price Mr. Rogers paid = Original price * 0.75

Step 2: Price his friend paid
Since he bought the watch from Mr. Rogers at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid:
Price his friend paid = Price Mr. Rogers paid * 1.2

Step 3: Find the percentage discount
Percentage discount = ((Original price - Price his friend paid) / Original price) * 100%

First, find the difference between the original price and the price his friend paid:
Original price - Price his friend paid

Now, substitute the prices we found above and calculate the percentage discount:
((2000 - (Price Mr. Rogers paid * 1.2)) / 2000) * 100%

Let's find Price Mr. Rogers paid first:
Price Mr. Rogers paid = Original price * 0.75

Substitute this value in the discount calculation formula:
((2000 - (Original price * 0.75 * 1.2)) / 2000) * 100%

We don't have enough information to determine the original price so we cannot find the exact percentage discount. However, we do have a formula for finding it if we know the original price.

The final answer is: Unfortunately, we cannot determine the percentage discount without knowing the original price.</s>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

The problem states that every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish.

Step 2: Determine how many jellyfish one spring produces in one minute.
Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, a spring creates 60 jellyfish in one minute.

Step 3: Determine how many jellyfish one spring produces in one hour.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so a spring creates 60 * 60 = 3600 jellyfish in one hour.

Five springs working at the same rate would create 5 * 3600 = 18000 jellyfish in one hour.

Step 5: Determine how many jellyfish 5 springs create in 4 hours.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours in a day, and 4 hours is two thirds of a day (or 2 * 24 / 3 = 2x24/3 = 8 hours), 5 springs would create 5 * 3600 * 8 = 115200 jellyfish in 4 hours.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it took James to walk to the store before he had to turn back, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

First, let's calculate the time it took James to walk to the store:

distance to store = 4 miles
James' walking speed = 4 miles per hour

time to store = distance to store / James' walking speed
time to store = 4 miles / 4 miles per hour
time to store = 1 hour

{At this point, James reached the store.}

Since James had to walk back home after realizing he forgot something, the total distance he walked was 8 miles (4 miles to the store and 4 miles back home). The time it took him to walk back home would also be 1 hour because the speed was the same.

Since James spent 1 hour at the store (and this is included in the 2 hours of total walking time), then the time it took him to walk to the store was 1 hour as well.

The final answer is: It took James 1 hour to walk to the store.</s>","He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's represent the amount of fence that Sam gets with the variable S. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can represent the amount of fence that Harry gets with the variable H.

Step 2: We know that the total amount of fence between them is 100 feet. So, we have the equation: S + H = 100.

Step 3: We also know that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. So, we have the equation: S < H.

Step 4: To find how much fence is left for Sam, we need to find the value of S. Since we have two equations and three variables, we can't directly find the values of S and H. However, we can find the difference between the amount of fence that Harry gets and the amount that Sam gets.

Step 5: From the given information, we have: H = S +60.

Step 6: Substituting the value of H in the first equation, we get: S + (S+60) = 100.

Step 7: Solving the equation, we get: S = 40. This means that Sam gets 40 feet of fence.

Step 8: To find the amount of fence left for Sam, we subtract the amount of fence that Sam gets from the total amount of fence: 100 - 40 = 60.

The final answer is: Sam has 60 feet of fence left over.</s>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100

Half of them were ; Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The , rest of the sold bikes ? were MTB type. How much : did Marcel earn from selling ? bicycles during that month?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many bikes of each type were sold.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking, so there were 0.5 * 300 = <<0.5*300=150>>150 Trekking bikes sold.
- 15% of the bikes were BMX, so there were 0.15 * 300 = <<0.15*300=45>>45 BMX bikes sold.
- The rest of the bikes were MTB, so there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 MTB bikes sold.

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from each type of bike.
- Marcel earned $500 from selling each MTB, so he earned 105 * $500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52,500 from MTB bikes.
- Marcel earned $450 from each Trekking bike, so he earned 150 * $450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67,500 from Trekking bikes.
- Marcel earned half of the price of an MTB from each BMX bike (since the price of a BMX is half the price of an MTB), so the price of an MTB is $500, so Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11,250 from BMX bikes.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue earned that month.
Marcel earned a total of $52,500 (MTB) + $67,500 (Trekking) + $11,250 (BMX) = $<<52500+67500+11250=131250>>131,250. {The final answer is $131,250}.</s>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

- Number of classes per week = Periods per day * Days per week
- Classes per week = 6 periods/day * 5 days/week = 30 classes/week
- Duration of each class = 40 minutes

Step 2: Find out how many minutes John spends on classes per week.
- Weekly minutes for classes = Number of classes per week * Duration of each class
- Weekly minutes for classes = 30 classes/week * 40 minutes/class = 1200 minutes/week

Step 3: Calculate the time he spends on extra classes per week.
- Extra classes per week = 2 classes/week
- Duration of each extra class = 40 minutes
- Weekly minutes for extra classes = Extra classes per week * Duration of each extra class
- Weekly minutes for extra classes = 2 classes/week * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes/week

Step 4: Add the weekly minutes spent on classes and extra learning together.
- Total weekly minutes = Weekly minutes for classes + Weekly minutes for extra classes
- Total weekly minutes = 1200 minutes/week + 80 minutes/week = 1280 minutes/week

Step 5: Find the total hours John spends learning per week.
- We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
- Total hours per week = Total weekly minutes / Minutes per hour
- Total hours per week = 1280 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 21.33 hours/week

{The final answer is: John spends approximately 21.33 hours learning per week.}</s>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

Given that Nathan drops the ball from a third-floor balcony, which is a height of 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

Step 2: Calculate the height of the second bounce.
Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height each time, we need to find the height of the first bounce:
1st bounce = 72 feet
2nd bounce = 2/3 * 1st bounce

A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?
                 [/INST] Let's work through this problem step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much meat was left on the Triceratops after the T-Rex had eaten half of it.
Let X be the weight of the Triceratops.
So, the amount of meat the T-Rex ate is X/2

2. When the velociraptors came, they scavenged half of what was left. So, the amount of meat the velociraptors ate is (X/2)/2

3. The remaining meat after both the T-Rex and velociraptors had eaten was 270 kilograms. So, we can set up an equation:
 (X/2) + [(X/2)/2] + 270 = X

4. To simplify the equation, we can first find the total amount of meat eaten by the T-Rex and velociraptors:
 (X/2) + [(X/2)/2] = X/2(1+1/2) = X/2 * 3/2

5. Now, we can subtract the Total amount of meat eaten by T-rex and Velociraptors from the original weight of the Triceratops and get X.
X - (X/2 * 3/2) = 270

6. Solving for X, we get,
X = 2*(3/2)*270 = 648 kilograms

So, the original weight of the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate it was {The final answer is: 648 kilograms}.</s>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

- East and West wall: 5 feet x 8 feet = 40 square feet

Step 2: Find the total area that needs to be painted:
Total Area = Area of North and South walls + Area of East and West walls
Total Area = 80 square feet + 40 square feet
Total Area = 120 square feet

Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed:
Number of Gallons = Total Area to be painted / Area covered by one gallon of paint
Number of Gallons = 120 square feet / 20 square feet per gallon
Number of Gallons = 6 gallons

Step 4: Find the cost of 6 gallons of paint:

                 [/INST] To solve the problem, let's find out first how many people were in the cars and then in the buses.

1. There were 20 private cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, there were 20 cars * 3 people/car = <<20*3=60>>60 people in cars.

2. There were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, there were 12 buses * 35 people/bus = <<12*35=420>>420 people in buses.

Therefore, the total number of people inside the church is the number of people in cars plus the number of people in buses. {The final answer is: 60 people (in cars) + 420 people (in buses) = <<60+420=480>>480 people inside the church}</s>","There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha's age can be found by subtracting 4 years from Mike's age.
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4

Step 2: We also know that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age can be found by adding 10 years to Martha's age.
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10

Step 3: We are given that Mike is 24 years old, so let's find Martha's age first.
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4
Martha's age = 20

Step 4: Now let's find Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age.
Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10

The second biggest waterslide . is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?
                 [/INST] To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we first need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide.

Time to ride the biggest slide = Length of the biggest slide / Speed people slide down
= 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
= 5 hours / 3 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
= 5/3 hours

Time to ride the second biggest slide = Length of the second biggest slide / Speed people slide down
= 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
= 3 hours

Now, let's find the difference in time:

Difference in time = Time to ride the biggest slide - Time to ride the second biggest slide
= (5/3 hours) - 3 hours
= (5/3 - 3) hours
= (5-9)/3 hours (subtracting the whole numbers)
= -2/3 hours

Since a negative number doesn't make sense in this context, it means that the time to ride the second biggest slide is actually shorter than the time to ride the biggest slide. Therefore, the question may have an incorrect premise.

However, if we assume for the sake of argument that the question is correct, then the answer would be:

It takes a difference of 2/3 hours longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

But since the second slide takes less time than the biggest slide to ride, there is no final answer in this case.</s>","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes

                 [/INST] First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks per day:
Breaks per day = 2 * 15 minutes
Breaks per day = 2 * 15 * 1 hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
Breaks per day = 30 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks and his lunch per day:
Total time per day = Lunch + Breaks
Total time per day = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks)
Total time per day = 1 hour

Finally, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on breaks and lunch per 5 days:
Total time in 5 days = Total time per day * 5 days
Total time in 5 days = 1 hour/day * 5 days
Total time in 5 days = 5 hours
{The final answer is: After 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours.}</s>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

1. We know that Amber ran 8 miles.
2. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we can calculate how many miles Micah ran: Micah ran = 3.5 * Amber's miles = 3.5 * 8 = 28 miles.
3. The total miles ran by both Amber and Micah is 8 miles (Amber) + 28 miles (Micah) = 36 miles.
4. We know that the total miles ran by all three runners is 52 miles, so we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran: Ahito's miles = Total miles (52) - Miles run by Amber (8) - Miles run by Micah (28) = 52 - 8 - 28 = 16 miles.

{The final answer is: Ahito ran 16 miles.}</s>","Amber ran <<8=8>>8 miles.

The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a , UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, so if S represents the total number of jellyfish, then the number of large jellyfish is 5S/10 = 0.5S.

2. Of the large jellyfish, a third change color when UV light is turned on, so the number of large, color-changing jellyfish is 0.5S * 1/3 = S/6.

3. We're told that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on. However, not all of these jellyfish were large and color-changing. Some of them could be small and always blue.

4. Let's denote the number of small, always blue jellyfish as X, and the number of large, color-changing jellyfish as Y. We know that Y = S/6, so S = 6Y.

5. Since X represents the number of small, always blue jellyfish, and there are (S - X) jellyfish that are large and change color, we have S = X + (6Y), or X = S - 6Y.

6. Now we have a system of two equations:
   1. S = X + 6Y
   2. X = S - 6Y

7. Solving this system of equations, we find that X = S/2 and Y = S/12.

8. The total number of jellyfish in the tank is S = X + Y = S/2 + S/12, which simplifies to S = 3S/2, or S = 2S/3.

9. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 3/2, we get S = 3S/3 = 3. This doesn't make sense, as the number of jellyfish should be a positive integer. There seems to be a mistake in the problem, or some missing information.

10. The final answer is not provided in the given information.</s>","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.

Ben's age = 2 * Chris's age
Ben's age = 2 * 4
Ben's age = 8

Next, we're told that Caroline is three times older than Ben. So, Caroline's age would be:

The amount Lauren saves every year = Current annual salary * Savings percentage
= $100,000 * 0.2
= $20,000

Next, we need to find out how much money Lauren needs to save for a retirement period of 20 years. Since she plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary during retirement, the total amount she needs to save for 20 years is:

Total amount to be saved = Annual savings needed during retirement * Number of years in retirement
= $40,000 * 20
= $800,000

Now, we need to determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save this amount if she continues saving 20% of her current annual salary each year. We can use the formula:

Number of years = Total amount to be saved / (Current annual salary * Savings percentage)
= $800,000 / ($100,000 * 0.2)

To calculate the above expression, we first divide the total amount to be saved by the annual savings percentage:

Number of years = $800,000 / $20,000
= $40

Then, we divide $40 by the savings percentage to get the number of years in terms of the current annual salary:

Number of years = $40 / 0.2
= $200,000 / $100,000
= 20

The final answer is: {Lauren needs to work for an additional 20 years}.</s>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year

1. Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon initially.

2. He makes the first cut into 4 equal parts. Since the parts must be equal, we divide the total length by the number of parts:

Length of one part after the first cut = Initial length / Number of parts
Length of one part after the first cut = 100 cm / 4
Length of one part after the first cut = 25 cm

3. Now, he makes the second cut on each part to create 5 equal parts.

Length of one part after the second cut = Length of one part after the first cut / Number of parts
Length of one final part = 25 cm / 5

1. First, let's find the total number of students in the school. From the given information, we know that there are 240 boys, and 40% of the total population are boys. So, the total population can be calculated using the following formula:

Total Population = Number of Boys / Percentage of Boys
Total Population = 240 boys / 0.4
Total Population = 600 boys / 0.4
Total Population = 1500 students

2. Since 40% of the school population is made up of boys, it follows that 60% of the school population must be girls. So, we can find the number of girls by calculating 60% of the total population.

Number of Girls = Total Population * Percentage of Girls
Number of Girls = 1500 students * 0.6
Number of Girls = 900 students

{The final answer is: There are 900 girls in the school.}</s>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

                    question:
                    Although Soledad works . in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of , June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?
                 [/INST] First, let's calculate how many miles Soledad plans to hike in total during her vacation in June.

Total miles to hike = Miles hiked per day * Number of days in June
Total miles to hike = 125 miles * 30 days
Total miles to hike = 3750 miles

However, Soledad's planned total miles to hike (3750 miles) is different from the given total miles to hike (9300 miles). Therefore, she needs to hike more miles per day to meet her goal.

The difference in miles that Soledad needs to cover each day = Total miles to hike - Miles hiked per day

The difference in miles per day = 9300 miles - 125 miles/day
The difference in miles per day = 8125 miles/day

{The final answer is: Soledad must hike an additional 8125 miles per day to complete her 9300-mile hike in the month of June.}

However, it's important to note that 8125 miles per day is an unrealistic goal, and Soledad would need to reevaluate her plan or reduce her total miles to achieve her goal in a reasonable and safe way.</s>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day
Initially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day
To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total number of balls in the store.
Total number of balls = Red balls + Blue balls + Green balls
Total number of balls = 3 (red) + 11 (blue) + 25 (green) = 39 balls

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling all red balls.
Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls * Price per red ball
Revenue from red balls = 3 (red balls) * $9 (price per red ball) = $27

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling all blue balls.
Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls * Price per blue ball
Revenue from blue balls = 11 (blue balls) * $5 (price per blue ball) = $55

Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling all green balls.
Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls * Price per green ball
Revenue from green balls = 25 (green balls) * $3 (price per green ball) = $75

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from selling all balls.
Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
Total revenue = $27 + $55 + $75 = $157

1. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought a total of 12 kg of apples.
2. Pierre is not mentioned in the problem regarding sharing the apples further. So we focus on what Pierre, Paul, and Jacques have left for Peter and Paul.
3. Pierre, Paul, and Jacques have 12 kg of apples altogether.
4. Peter wants a quarter of that amount: 12 kg * 1/4 = 3 kg
5. Paul wants 1/3 of that amount: 12 kg * 1/3 = 4 kg
6. However, the problem asks for the amount left for James, not the shares for Peter and Paul. Since we haven't been told how much they take for themselves, we cannot determine the amount left for James based on the provided information.

The final answer is: {We cannot determine the amount left for James based on the given information}.</s>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.

1. Anna's initial budget was $16.
2. She had already spent $4, leaving her with $12 ($16 - $4).
3. She bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount.
4. After buying these 2 books, Anna had $2 left in her budget ($12 - total cost of 2 books).

Let x be the cost of each book.
Then the total cost of 2 books is 2x.

Setting up an equation: $12 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2:
x = $12 / 2
x = $6

{The final answer is: Each book cost $6.}</s>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.

First, let's calculate the rate of blinking in minutes per blink:
1. Find out how many seconds are in 5 minutes: 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 300 seconds.
2. Divide the total number of seconds by the total number of blinks to find the number of seconds per blink: 300 seconds / 255 blinks = approximately 1.178 seconds/blink.

Now that we know how long one blink takes, we can calculate how long it takes for 459 blinks:
1. Multiply the number of blinks (459) by the duration of one blink (1.178 seconds): 459 blinks * 1.178 seconds/blink = 537.8614 seconds.
2. Convert the decimal part of the seconds to hundredths and round to the nearest whole number: 0.8614 * 100 = 86. Since this is not an entire second, ignore it.

1. Distance traveled per visit:
Since it takes John 2 hours to drive there at 70 mph, we can calculate the distance by multiplying his speed by the time it takes him to get there:
Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 70 miles per hour * 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

2. Miles driven per month:
John visits his parents twice a month, so we can multiply the distance traveled per visit by the number of visits he makes in a month:
Miles driven per month = Distance per visit *Number of visits per month
Miles driven per month = 140 miles * 2 visits

We know that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. And we're given that Sofie walks 10 miles every day.

Let's set up an equation to represent this information:

Sofie's total miles in 7 days = 2 * Brian's total miles in 7 days
10 miles/day * 7 days = 2 * (Brian's miles/day * 7 days)

Solving for Brian's miles/day:

70 miles (Sofie) = 2 * (Brian's miles/day * 7 days)

Dividing both sides by 7 days to find Brian's miles/day:

Brian's miles/day = 70 miles / (2 * 7)
Brian's miles/day = 10 miles / 2
Brian's miles/day = 5 miles

So, Brian walks 5 miles every day. To find the total miles Brian walks in 7 days, we multiply his daily miles by the number of days:

Total miles for Brian in 7 days = Brian's miles/day * 7 days
Total miles for Brian in 7 days = 5 miles/day * 7 days
Total miles for Brian in 7 days = 35 miles

{The final answer is Brian walks 35 miles in seven days.}</s>","If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.

- Two workers produce 6 toys an hour. So, the contribution of these two workers is 6 toys per hour.
- The other two workers produce 4 toys an hour. So, the contribution of these two workers is 4 toys per hour.
- The total number of toys produced by all four workers in an hour is: 6 toys/hour (for the first two workers) + 4 toys/hour (for the second two workers) = 10 toys/hour.

Now that we know all four workers can produce 10 toys per hour, let's find out how many toys they can produce during their 10-hour workday: 10 toys/hour * 10 hours = 100 toys.

However, the manufacturer needs a total of 420 toys for the order. Currently they have 100 toys and need an additional 320 toys.

To find out how many toes the fifth worker must produce per hour to meet the target, calculate the difference between the targeted number of toys and the number of toys already produced, and divide it by the total number of hours worked in a shift: (Targeted Number of Toys - Number of Toys Produced) / Total Hours Worked = Toys Produced per Hour by Fifth Worker

320 toys (additional required) / 10 hours = 32 toys/hour

However, this calculation appears to be incorrect since a single worker cannot produce such a high number of toys per hour. This contradiction highlights the fact that the initial information of 5 workers producing enough toys during their 10-hour shift for the order might not be accurate.

{The final answer is: An error in the initial calculation or data provided makes it impossible to determine the production rate of the fifth worker. This contradiction requires reevaluating the input.}</s>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Elijah has two dogs. One dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so let's call the weight of Elijah's first dog x. Then, Kory's dog weighs 4x.

Step 2: The other dog that Elijah has is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it weighs 30 pounds (since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds).

Step 3: To find the total weight of both dogs that Elijah owns, we can add the weights of each dog: x (fourth the weight of Kory's dog) + 30 (half the weight of Kory's dog).

Step 4: Since x is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog (60 pounds), we can write the relationship as: x = (1/4) * 60 = 15 pounds.

Step 5: Therefore, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds, and his second dog weighs 30 pounds. The total weight of their dogs is 15 + 30 = <u>45 pounds</u>.

                 [/INST] Let's reason through this problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had as S. Then, the number of stickers Luis received was S/2.

2. Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, the number of stickers Luis used was S/2, and the number of stickers he gave to Kris was S/2 as well.

3. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. Therefore, the number of stickers Kris kept was 9, and the number of stickers she gave to Rob was S/2 - 9.

4. To find the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning, let's set up an equation using the available information: S = 2(S/2) + S/2 + 9 + (S/2 - 9)

5. Simplifying the equation, we get: S = 3S/2 + 9

6. Multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction, we have: 2S = 3S + 18

7. Subtracting 3S from both sides, we have: -S = 18

8. Dividing both sides by -1, we find that S = -18, which doesn't make sense because the number of stickers cannot be negative. This means there is an error in the given problem. {The final answer is: There is an error in the given problem, as the number of stickers cannot be negative.}

Therefore, the problem has inconsistent information, and we cannot find a valid solution for the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning.</s>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.

                 [/INST] To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far Alfie flies in one day as a fraction of the distance around the earth. We know that Alfie flies 400 kilometers per day and the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers.

Step 1: Find the fraction of the earth's circumference that Alfie flies in one day.

Fraction of earth's circumference flown by Alfie in 1 day = Distance Alfie flies in 1 day / Total circumference of the earth

Step 2: Calculate the distance Alfie flies in 1 day as a proportion of the total circumference of the earth.

Fraction of earth's circumference flown by Alfie in 1 day = 400 kilometers / 40,000 kilometers

Step 3: Simplify the fraction to find out what fraction of the earth's circumference Alfie covers in one day.

Fraction of earth's circumference flown by Alfie in 1 day = 0.01 or 1%

Step 4: To find out how many days it takes Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the circumference of the earth, we need to determine how long it takes him to fly 50% of the earth's circumference.

Step 5: Calculate the number of days Alfie needs to fly 50% of the earth's circumference.

Number of days = (Fraction of earth's circumference) / (Fraction of earth's circumference Alfie flies in one day)

Step 6: Plug the known quantities into the equation.

Number of days = (0.5) / (0.01)

Step 7: Perform the division operation to get the number of days Alfie needs to fly a distance equal to half of the earth's circumference.

Number of days = 50

The final answer is: It takes Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.</s>","Half of 40,000 kilometers is 40,000/2=<<40000/2=20000>>20,000 kilometers.

The : 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. ; The average car can go 120 Miles ; per hour. How fast does the faster car go?
                 [/INST] Step 1: We are given that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, and the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Let's define the average car's speed as x hours per hour.

Step 2: We know that the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so its speed is 5x hours per hour.

Step 3: The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, so its speed is 1.25 * 5x = 6.25x hours per hour.

Step 4: We want to find the value of x (the speed of the average car), so we can find the speed of the fastest car. To do this, we'll first find the ratio of the speeds of the fastest car and the second fastest car. We know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car, so the ratio of their speeds is 1.25:1.

Step 5: We can represent this ratio as a mathematical equation: Speed of fastest car = 1.25 * Speed of second fastest car

Step 6: Substituting the known values, we have 6.25x = 1.25 * (5x). To solve for x, we need to get x alone on one side of the equation. So, we can cancel out the x's by dividing both sides by 5.

Step 7: We get 6.25x = 1.25 * (5x) => 6.25x = 6.25 * 5 * x => 6.25x = 31.25x. Dividing both sides by 6.25, we get x = 31.25x / 6.25 => x = 5 hours per hour.

Step 8: Now that we have the speed of the average car, we can find the speed of the fastest car: 6.25x = 6.25 * (5 hours per hour) = 31.25 hours per hour.

The final answer is: The fastest car goes 31.25 hours per hour. However, it's important to note that this is an impractically high speed for a car.

Step 2: Now, Liam is 16 years old. That means his age two years ago was 16 - 2 = 14. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 14 = 2V.

Step 3: Solving for V, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: V = 14/2 = 7. So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old.

Step 4: To find Vince's age now, we add the two years that have passed since then: Vince's age = 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

Step 2: Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Here, Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so we can write the equation: X + 30 = 2X + 12

Step 3: Solving for X in the equation above, we first subtract X from both sides, then subtract 12 from the right side and divide by 1 on the left side: X = 14

Step 4: Arnold and Madeline painted X = 14 eggs each. The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline is 2X = 2*14 = 28

Step 5: Camden painted X + 30 = 14 + 30 = 15 eggs more than Arnold and Madeline. Therefore, Camden painted 15 - 14 = 1 more egg than Arnold in the first place. So, Camden painted 2 eggs more than Arnold overall because they both painted 14 eggs but Camden painted an additional 2 eggs.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the number of boxes Nik can make with his crayons.
Since Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8, the number of boxes he can make is:
200 crayons ÷ 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Step 2: Find the total weight of the crayons.
The weight of one crayon is .1 ounces, so the total weight of Nik's 200 crayons is:
200 crayons × .1 ounces per crayon = 20 pounds

Step 3: Find the total weight of the empty boxes.
Since each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 16 ounces in a pound, the total weight of 16 empty boxes is:
16 boxes × 8 ounces per box × 16 ounces per pound = 128 pounds

Step 4: Find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes.
The total weight of the crayons and the empty boxes is the sum of the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the empty boxes:

                 [/INST] Let's go through each step of the problem to find the answer.

Step 1: Determine the number of logs John gets from the tree.
The tree is cut down into logs represented by 80% of the tree's length. So, the number of logs is:
80-foot tree * 0.8 = 64 logs of 4 feet each

Step 2: Calculate the number of planks John gets from each log.
Each log is cut into 5 planks:
Number of planks from one log = 1 log * 5 planks = 5 planks

Step 3: Calculate the total number of planks John gets from all logs.
Total planks = Number of logs * Planks per log = 64 logs * 5 planks/log = 320 planks

Step 4: Determine the revenue John earns from selling each plank.
The price of one plank is $1.2:
Revenue from one plank = $1.2

Step 5: Calculate the total revenue John earns from selling all planks.
Total revenue = Number of planks * Price per plank = 320 planks * $1.2/plank = $384

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the time Grandma spends on the beach in minutes.
Since Grandma walks on the beach for 2 miles and spends 40 minutes there, we can first find her walking speed on the beach in miles per hour (mph), then convert the speed to minutes per mile (mins/mile) to find the time she spends on the 2-mile stretch.

First, let's find Grandma's walking speed on the beach in mph:
1 mile on the beach = 40 minutes
Walking speed on the beach = 1 mile / 40 minutes = 1/40 mph

Next, convert the beach walking speed from miles per hour to minutes per mile:
1 mile / hour = 60 minutes
Walking speed on the beach = (1 mile / hour) / (1 mile / 40 minutes) = 60 minutes / 40 = 1.5 hours

So, Grandma spends 1.5 hours (or 90 minutes) on the beach.

Step 2: Determine the time Grandma spends on the sidewalk in minutes.
Since Grandma walks 1 mile on the sidewalk and walks twice as fast as her beach walking speed, her time spent on the sidewalk in minutes can be calculated as follows:

Walking speed on the sidewalk = 2 * Walking speed on the beach
Walking speed on the sidewalk = 2 * (1 mile / hour) / (1 mile / 40 minutes) = (1 mile / hour) / (0.5 miles / hour) = 2 hours

So, Grandma spends 2 hours (or 120 minutes) on the sidewalk.

Step 3: Determine the total time it takes Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk in minutes.
Since Grandma spends 90 minutes on the beach and 120 minutes on the sidewalk, the total time spent on the walk is:

Total time spent on the walk = 90 minutes (beach) + 120 minutes (sidewalk) = 210 minutes

{The final answer is: It takes Grandma 210 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk.}</s>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how much money Jane has saved in the past 8 weeks. Since she saves $4 each week, the total amount saved can be calculated as:
Total amount saved = Savings per week * Number of weeks

Step 2: Let's calculate this:
Total amount saved = $4 * 8
Total amount saved = $32

Step 3: Jane now wants to save a total of $60. So, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to reach this goal:
Additional weeks needed = Total savings goal - Current total savings / Savings per week

Step 4: Let's calculate this:
Additional weeks needed = $60 - $32 / $4
Additional weeks needed = $24 / $4
Additional weeks needed = 6 weeks

The final answer is: It will take an additional 6 weeks for Jane to save a total of $60.</s>","She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.

                 [/INST] Let's call the initial number of marbles Bob has ""x."" We're given two pieces of information:

1. Bob receives 2 dozen (or 2 x 12 = 24) marbles, so now he has ""x + 24.""
2. He then has 60 marbles, so ""x + 24 = 60.""

To find the initial number of marbles, we need to solve the equation ""x + 24 = 60"":

1. Subtract 24 from both sides: x = 36.
   The final answer is: {Bob initially had 36 marbles}.

Next, let's find out how many marbles Bob has left after losing 10:

x - 10 = the final number of marbles.

                 [/INST] To determine the temperature of the second bottle, we need to make sure that the temperature of the water in Donny's water bottle is above 40 degrees. Let's call the temperature of the water in the second bottle x.

We know that Donny adds 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle to his water bottle. The total volume of water in the water bottle is not given, so we cannot directly calculate the final temperature, but we can set up an inequality to ensure that the final temperature is above 40 degrees.

Let's denote the temperature of the water in Donny's water bottle after mixing as T. The change in temperature due to adding 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug would be:

ΔT1 = m1 * c * ΔT

where m1 is the mass of the water in the 33-degree mug (in kg), c is the specific heat capacity of water (approximately 4.186 J/g * °C), and ΔT is the change in temperature in degrees Celsius.

We don't know the mass of the water in the 33-degree mug, but we do know that 4 ounces is about 0.113 kg. So ΔT1 would be approximately:

ΔT1 ≈ 0.113 kg * 4.186 J/g * °C * ΔT

Now let's calculate the change in temperature due to adding 1 ounce of water from the second bottle:

ΔT2 = m2 * c * ΔT

where m2 is the mass of the water in the second bottle (in kg).

To make sure that the final temperature is above 40 degrees, we need to have:

T = ΔT1 + ΔT2 + 33°C > 40°C

Substituting the expressions for ΔT1 and ΔT2 and solving for x:

ΔT1 + ΔT2 > 9°C
0.113 kg * 4.186 J/g * °C * ΔT + x * 4.186 J/g * °C * ΔT > 9°C

Dividing both sides of the inequality by 4.186 J/g * °C:

ΔT > (9°C - 0.113 kg * ΔT) / x

Solving this inequality for x:

x > (9°C / (ΔT + 0.113 kg * ΔT)) - 0.113 kg

Since ΔT is not given, we cannot find the exact temperature of the second bottle from this information. However, we can see that it must be above a certain threshold value to ensure that the final temperature is above 40 degrees.

Therefore, the temperature of the second bottle must be above a certain value depending on the initial temperature of the water in Donny's water bottle. Unfortunately, we cannot find the exact threshold temperature without knowing more information.

First, let's find out how many cows and chickens will be brought in each day for three weeks:

1. Cows from Milkie Cows Limited: 20 cows per day for 21 days (3 weeks) => 20 cows/day × 21 days
2. Chickens from Broilers Limited: 10 chickens per day for 21 days => 10 chickens/day × 21 days

Now, let's calculate the total number of cows and chickens that will be brought in:

Total cows = 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows
Total chickens = 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

Next, let's find the total number of animals (cows + chickens) on the farm after three weeks:

Total animals = Total cows + Total chickens = 420 cows + 210 chickens = 630 animals

Cost per pack = $10.00
Number of packs = 4

Total cost (without discount) = Cost per pack * Number of packs
Total cost (without discount) = $10.00 * 4
Total cost (without discount) = $40.00

Next, let's find out how much the discount is:

Discount = 10% of total cost (without discount)
Discount = 0.1 * $40.00
Discount = $4.00

Now, we will subtract the discount from the total cost without discount to find the final cost of 4 packs of bagels:

Final cost for 4 packs = Total cost (without discount) - Discount
Final cost for 4 packs = $40.00 - $4.00
Final cost for 4 packs = $36.00

Finally, we can calculate the cost of a single bagel after ordering 4 bags:

Cost for 4 packs = $36.00
Number of bagels in 4 packs = 4 * 9
Number of bagels in 4 packs = 36

Cost per bagel = Cost for 4 packs / Number of bagels in 4 packs
Cost per bagel = $36.00 / 36
Cost per bagel = $1.00

1. First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. We know that he ate 5 less than 23 scoops, so:
   Number of scoops = 23 - 5
   Number of scoops = 18 scoops

2. Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make one less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We're told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make one less than 3 scoops, which means:

   Potatoes required for 1 scoop = 3 + 6 = 9 potatoes

3. So, to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate in total, we multiply the number of scoops he ate by the number of potatoes required to make one scoop:

   Total potatoes = Scoops * Potatoes per scoop
   Total potatoes = 18 * 9
   Total potatoes = 162

1. First, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats during the first 30-day period, eating 3 eggs per day.
   Number of eggs = Eating Habit per Day * Number of Days
   = 3 eggs/day * 30 days
   = 90 eggs

2. Next, let's calculate the number of eggs Chester eats during the second 30-day period, eating 5 eggs per day.
   Number of eggs = Eating Habit per Day * Number of Days

4. Now, we'll convert the total number of eggs Chester will consume into dozens.
   We know that:

Step 2: Now that we know the number of red jelly beans, we can find the number of blue jelly beans by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans.

Total jelly beans = Green jelly beans + Red jelly beans + Blue jelly beans
60 = 17 + 34 + Blue jelly beans

Step 3: Subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans, we find the number of blue jelly beans:

First, let's find out how many women are in the bus according to the given ratio:

Men : Women = 5 : 9
Let x be the number of women, then the number of men on the bus is 5x/9.

The total number of passengers is 84, so:

Men + Women = 84
5x/9 + x = 84

To find a common denominator, we'll multiply both sides by 9:

5x + 9x = 752
14x = 752
x = 54.5267...

Since the number of passengers must be a whole number, it's clear that this ratio doesn't fit the total number of passengers (84), which suggests that the given ratio might not be correct.

To proceed with the provided question, let's assume that there were initially 45 men and 39 women on the bus (a total of 84 passengers). When 20 women left, the number of women on the bus changed to:

Number of women on the bus = Initial number of women - Women who left
Number of women on the bus = 39 - 20 = 19

So, there are currently 19 women on the bus.

{The final answer is: 19 women}</s>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14

                    question:
                    Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned ! $26 ? from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to : sell after 3 days?
                 [/INST] To find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we first need to find out how many sunflowers he sold as individual flowers and how many were in the bouquets he sold each day.

Let's look at the given information:

1. The cost of a single sunflower is $2.
2. The cost of a bouquet of 12 sunflowers is $8 (or $0.67 per sunflower).
3. Faraday earned $26 from selling sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets in one day, for a total of $82.

Now let's find out how many sunflowers were sold as individual flowers and how many were in the bouquets each day:

Let x be the number of sunflowers sold as individual flowers in one day.
Then the number of bouquets sold in one day is x/12 (since there are 12 sunflowers in each bouquet).

The total revenue from selling sunflowers is $2x (price per sunflower multiplied by the number of sunflowers sold).
The total revenue from selling bouquets is $56, so the revenue from selling individual sunflowers is $26 (we know that $26 + $56 = $82 is the total revenue for one day).

Setting up the equation, we get:
$2x + $56 = $82
Subtracting $56 from both sides:
$2x = $26
Dividing both sides by $2:
x = 13 sunflowers sold as individual flowers per day

Now, since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, and there are 3 days in the given time frame, we can calculate the total number of sunflowers sold as follows:

Total number of sunflowers sold = Sunflowers sold as individual flowers per day + Bouquets sold per day * Number of sunflowers per bouquet

So,
Total number of sunflowers sold = 13 sunflowers/day + (x/12 sunflowers/bouquet * 12 sunflowers/bouquet * 3 days)

Substituting the value of x = 13 sunflowers/day, we get:

Total number of sunflowers sold = 13 + (13 * 3 * 12)

Total number of sunflowers sold = 13 + 117

Total number of sunflowers sold = 126

Therefore, the final answer is: Faraday was able to sell 126 sunflowers after 3 days.</s>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue Adam can make by selling 60% of his inventory.

How many days will it take for her to create all of the picture scenes?
                 [/INST] To find out how many days it takes for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to find out how many picture scenes she can draw per day with each size, and then calculate how many days she needs to draw each size to complete the project.

1. Large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days needed to complete 45 large-sized picture scenes is:
{45 / 5 = 9 days}

2. Medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days needed to complete 36 medium-sized picture scenes is:
{36 / 6 = 6 days}

3. Small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. So, the number of days needed to complete 49 small-sized picture scenes is:
{49 / 7 = 7 days}

Since Lauren is working on this project alone, she needs to complete all the picture scenes in the shortest possible time. To do this, she should focus on the medium-sized picture scenes first, as she can complete them the fastest. After completing the medium-sized picture scenes, she can move on to the large-sized picture scenes, and finally, the small-sized picture scenes.

Therefore, the total number of days she needs to complete the project is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the days needed for each size. To find the GCD, we use the Euclidean algorithm:

GCD(a, b) = a % b (if a < b)
             = b (if a >= b)

Applying this algorithm to the numbers of days for medium-sized and large-sized picture scenes:

GCD(6, 9) = 3

So, the project will take 3 days if she focuses on the medium-sized picture scenes first.

Therefore, the final answer is: {Lauren will need 3 days to complete the project}.</s>","At 5 small-sized picture scenes per day, 45 small-sized scenes will take 45/5 = <<45/5=9>>9 days.
At 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, 36 medium-sized scenes will take 36/6 = <<36/6=6>>6 days.
At 7 large-sized picture scenes per day, 49 large-sized scenes will take 49/7 = <<49/7=7>>7 days.
Altogether, the entire project will take 9 + 6 +7 = <<9+6+7=22>>22 days to complete.

                 [/INST] To find out how many eggs each child receives, we first need to determine how many eggs Chatty prepared in total for her four children. The problem states that she prepared three dozen eggs. A dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs, so we have:

Total eggs = 3 * 12 = 36 eggs

Since there are four children and the eggs are evenly distributed, we can divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find out how many eggs each child gets.

Eggs per child = Total eggs / Number of children = 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs

However, this answer seems incorrect because 9 eggs is not an equal distribution among 4 children. When we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children, we actually get the number of full sets of eggs each child would receive, plus the remaining eggs to divide equally among the children. Since there are 4 children, there will always be one child receiving one less egg than the others. Let's double-check our calculation with this in mind:

Eggs per child for full sets = Total eggs / Number of children = 36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs

Now, we take one egg away from the portion each child would normally get and give it to another child:

Additional eggs for one child = 1 egg

We've subtracted one egg from the number of eggs each child gets in a full set, so we need to add one more egg that one child will get:

Total eggs for children = (9 eggs - 1) * 4 children + 4 extra eggs = 32 eggs + 4 eggs = 36 eggs

There you have it! Each child receives 8 eggs and one child receives 9 eggs. {The final answer is: Each child gets 8 eggs, and one child gets 9 eggs.}</s>","Chatty prepared 3 dozen x 12 eggs/dozen = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.

P(first ticket wins) = 0.2

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its probability is:

P(second ticket wins) = 3 * 0.2 = 0.6

Since the occurrences of the two events are independent, we can find the probability of both happening by multiplying their individual probabilities:

P(both tickets win) = P(first ticket wins) * P(second ticket wins)
                    = 0.2 * 0.6

                 [/INST] Let's denote the height of Carl as C, the height of Ned as N, and the height of Isabel as I. From the problem, we have the following relationships:

C > N
N = C - 1
I = C + 2 (where C, N, and I are all in feet)

We're trying to find the length of Carl's cane, which is given as being half as long as Carl is tall:

Cane Length = C / 2

Now, let's find the height of Ned and Isabel using the relationships given in the problem:

Since N = C - 1, we can find the height of Ned in terms of Carl's height:

N = C - 1
N = C - 1 foot

Since Isabel is two feet shorter than Ned, we can find her height as well:

I = C + 2
I = C + 2 feet

Now, let's find Carl's height using the given relationships and find the length of his cane:

C > N
C > (C - 1)
C > C - 1
C = C + 1
C = 2C - 1
C = (2C-1) feet

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we can find the length of his cane using what we know about his height:

Cane Length = C / 2
Cane Length = (2C-1) / 2
Cane Length = (2C-1) / 2 feet

Since Isabel's height is given and we know that Ned is one foot shorter than Carl, we can use Isabel's height to find Carl's height:

                    question:
                    The Hortex company produces : bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. . How ; many more bottles of juices would Hortex have , to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?
                 [/INST] To find out how many more bottles of juices Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first need to calculate the number of bottles needed to cover 20% of the energy demand of one person, and then scale that up to cover the energy needs of 2300 people.

1. first, we need to find out how many bottles are needed to cover 20% of the energy demand of one person:
   - Let x be the number of bottles needed to cover 20% of the energy demand of one person
   - We know that each bottle can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand
   - So, x bottles = 20% of one person's daily energy demand

2. To find the amount of daily energy demand of one person, we don't have a specific value given in the problem, so we'll assume for simplicity that one person needs 2000 kilocalories (kcal) per day.

3. Convert the percentage to a decimal for calculation: 20% = 0.2

4. To find the number of bottles needed to cover 20% of one person's energy demand:
   - x = 20% of one person's daily energy demand
   - x = 0.2 * One person's daily energy demand
   - x = 0.2 * 2000 kcal
   - x = 400 kcal
   - Since one bottle covers 40 kcal and we're dealing with whole numbers here, we may assume a bottle covers an equivalent of 40 kcal
   - x = 400 kcal / 40 kcal per bottle = 10 bottles.

5. Now we know that 10 bottles can cover 20% of the energy demand of one person:

6. To calculate how many bottles are needed to satisfy 100% of the energy demand of 2300 people:
   - We first calculate the total energy demand of 2300 people: 2300 people * 2000 kcal per person = 4,600,000 kcal
   - Then we calculate the number of bottles required to cover the total energy demand: 4,600,000 kcal / 40 kcal per bottle = 115,000 bottles

7. Therefore, the difference between the number of bottles Hortex currently produces and the number required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people is:
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day
   - They need to produce 115,000 bottles to satisfy 100% of the energy needs of 2300 people.
   - The difference = 115,000 bottles - 4200 bottles = 110,800 bottles.

{The final answer is 110,800 more bottles of juices would be required}

It's important to remember that this is a simplified answer, as it assumed that one person needs 2000 kcal per day, and that a bottle covers 40 kcal. The actual values might differ, but this should give you an estimation of the required difference in production.</s>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

                 [/INST] To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first need to determine the number of babies wearing purple and the number of babies wearing bows.

1. Identical octuplets means there are 8 babies born.

2. Carla dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 8 x 3/4 = 6 babies.

3. She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is 8 x 1/4 = 2 babies.

4. 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows. Since there are 6 babies wearing purple, 1/3 of them wear bows, which is 6 x 1/3 = 2 babies.

5. There are also 2 babies wearing blue who wear bows, as it was not specified in the question that only the purple-wearers wear bows.

6. To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we can calculate the ratio of the number of babies wearing purple and bows over the total number of babies wearing bows.

7. The total number of babies wearing bows is 6 (purple-wearers) + 2 (blue-wearers) = 8 babies.

8. The percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is (Number of babies wearing purple and bows / Total number of babies wearing bows) x 100%.

9. So, (6 / 8) x 100% = 75%.

{The final answer is, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 75%.}.</s>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies
Then multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies
Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

Step 2: We also know that on Monday and Tuesday, they received a total of 1907 reports. And on Thursday and Friday, they received a total of 2136 reports.

Step 3: So, to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday-Tuesday and Thursday-Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Step 4: First, let's find out how many reports were received from Monday-Tuesday and Thursday-Friday.

Reports received on Monday-Tuesday: 1907
Reports received on Thursday-Friday: 2136

Total reports received on Monday-Tuesday and Thursday-Friday: 1907 + 2136 = 4043

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the size of the land Abraham sold in each transaction.
- He sold half of the 80 square meters, so that's 80 * 0.5 = {40 square meters}
- He sold a quarter of the land after a month, which is 80 * 0.25 = {20 square meters}

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from each transaction.
- He sold 40 square meters for $50, so the price per square meter is $50 / 40 = {$1.25}
- He sold 20 square meters for $30, so the price per square meter is $30 / 20 = {$1.5}

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining land.
The land Abraham had left after the first two sales was 80 - 40 - 20 = {20 square meters}
He sold this land for $3 per square meter, so the revenue is 20 * $3 = {$60}

Step 4: Add up all the revenues to find the total earnings.
Total revenue = Revenue from first sale + Revenue from second sale + Revenue from third sale
Total revenue = $1.25 * 40 + $1.5 * 20 + $60
Total revenue = ($50 + $30) + $60
Total revenue = $120 + $60
The final answer is: Abraham will be able to earn a total of {$180} after selling all his unused land.</s>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.

3. We want to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days.

First, let's calculate how many times Tyrion goes out in 2 days:
2 days * 3 times a day = 6 outings in 2 days

Next, since Tyrion changes his face mask twice during each outing, we need to multiply the number of outings by the number of mask changes per outing to find the total number of masks used in 2 days:
6 outings * 2 mask changes = 12 mask changes in 2 days

However, since each mask change represents the use of one face mask, the final answer is:

It's important to note that the given values don't provide valid solutions for centimeter measurements as the length for Y is not a whole number. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake or incomplete information in the problem statement.

To find the length of the red rope, R, if it were possible to have valid centimeter measurements, we could have used the expression derived in step 1: R = 4B.

If B = 10.83, then R = 4 * 10.83 = 43.32 (rounded) centimeters. However, due to the issue with the measurement of Y, this final answer is likely incorrect as well.

                    question:
                    Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given ! thrice as much. After each of them had ! given an equal ? amount of money to their little sister, Rissa ? is left with 4/5 of her money. How much is left in Ronnie's money?
                 [/INST] Let's denote the amount of money given to Rissa as x. According to the problem, Rissa was given three times as much money as Ronnie, so Ronnie was given x/3.

Next, let's assume that each sibling gave an equal amount a to their little sister. The problem states that Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so we can set up the equation:

Rissa's money after giving to little sister = x - a
(4/5)x = x - a

To solve for the difference between Rissa's initial and final amounts (a), we can first find the value of x:

x = 3Ronnie's money = x/3

Substituting x/3 for Ronnie's money in our initial equation:

(4/5)x = (x/3) - a

We don't have enough information to find the exact value of a, but we can set up the equation in terms of Ronnie's money. Let's first find x:

x = 3Ronnie's money = 3x/3 = x

Now we can find the difference (a) between Rissa's initial and final amounts:

(4/5)x = (x/3) - a
(4/5)x = x/3 - a
(4/5)x = x/3 - (Ronnie's money)

To find the final amount of money (Ronnie's money) we have:

x = 3(Ronnie's money) => Ronnie's money = x/3

Substituting Ronnie's money in the equation we derived for a:

(4/5)(x/3) = x/3 - Ronnie's money

Simplifying:

(4/5)(x/3) = x/3 - (x/3)
(4/5)(x/3) = (4/5)x/3

Canceling terms:

x = (5/4)(Ronnie's money)

Now we know that x = 3Ronnie's money, so:

(5/4)(Ronnie's money) = 3Ronnie's money

Solving for Ronnie's money:

Ronnie's money = (3/5)*(5/4)*(Ronnie's money) = (3/4)*Ronnie's money

Ronnie's money = (1/4)*Ronnie's money

Ronnie's money = Ronnie's money/4

Canceling terms:

Ronnie's money = 4Ronnie's money/4

Ronnie's money = 1Ronnie's money

Therefore, Ronnie's money is equal to 1. However, we know that he was given $5. Since $1 doesn't equal $5, the problem has wrong information and cannot be solved with the given premises.

{The final answer is: This problem cannot be solved with the given premises.}</s>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

                 [/INST] To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we need to first determine the amount of each color in the mural and then find the amount of red paint based on that information.

1. We know that the mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half of the mural is yellow.
2. Let's assume the entire mural is made up of x pints of paint. So, the red, white, and purple parts each make up (x/2) pints.
3. We know that (x/2) pints of paint is half of the mural, which is all yellow. So, the yellow part makes up x pints in total.
4. Half of the mural is yellow, so the other half must be the red, white, and purple parts. Therefore, the red, white, and purple parts make up x pints as well.
5. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and there are three colors, we know that the amount of paint for each color is x/3 pints.
6. To find the amount of red paint, we simply multiply the amount of paint per color by 1 (since there is one color of red): x/3 pints.
7. We know that the mural used 12 pints of paint in total. So, we can set up an equation to find the value of x: (x/3) + (x/2) + x = 12
8. Solving for x, we get x = 6 pints (this is the total amount of paint for all three colors).
9. So, the amount of red paint in the mural is (x/3) pints = (6/3) pints = 2 pints.

{The final answer is: 2 pints of red paint were used.}</s>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

                 [/INST] Let's call the area of one bedroom A. So, the area of one bedroom is 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is 5 * A = 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet.

We know the area of one bedroom is 240 square feet, and the area of the living room is 1200 square feet. The rest of the house has an area of 1000 square feet.

First, let's find the area of the 4 bedrooms in the house:
Area of 4 bedrooms = Number of bedrooms * Area of one bedroom
Area of 4 bedrooms = 4 * 240
Area of 4 bedrooms = 960 square feet

Now, let's find the area of the rest of the house (excluding the living room and bedrooms):
Area of rest of the house = Total area of the house - Area of bedrooms - Area of living room
Area of rest of the house = 1000 sq ft - 960 sq ft - 1200 sq ft
Area of rest of the house = -1160 sq ft

1. On Monday, Alice sees 3 puffs of clouds.
2. The number of clouds she sees each day after Monday is double the number of clouds she saw the previous day. So, we have:

                    question:
                    A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the ; same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?
                 [/INST] To find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 with the new box, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box and then calculate how many cycles one pod can pay for.

Given that:
1. A regular box costs $12 for 100 pods.
2. The new box costs the same $12 but has 20% more pods.

To find the number of pods in the new box, let's calculate:
100 pods (regular box) * 1.20 (20% more) = 120 pods

Now that we know there are 120 pods in the new box, we'll figure out how many cycles $1 can pay for with one pod.

$12 (cost of new box) / 120 (number of pods in new box) = $0.10 per pod
Since $1 can pay for 10 such pods:
10 pods * 1 dishwashing cycle per pod = 10 dishwashing cycles

However, this answer does not provide the correct number of cycles as the question asks for the number of cycles that can be run for $1, not $10.

Let's adjust our calculation for $1 as follows:
$0.10 (cost per pod) = $1.00 (cost for 10 pods) / 10 = $0.10 per pod

We can run 10 dishwashing cycles with $1 on the regular box. But using the new box, we can have 20% more pods. So the number of cycles we can run for $1 with the new box would be:

$0.10 (cost per pod) * 20% more pods (in the new box) = $0.12 per pod
$1.00 (cost for 10 pods) = $1.20
Number of cycles using $1 = 10 cycles / ($1.20 cost for 10 pods) = 8.3333... ≈ 8 cycles (rounded down since we can't run a fraction of a cycle)

So {The final answer is - you can run 8 dishwashing cycles with the new box for $1.}</s>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills, so he has a total of $1000 / $20 = <<1000/20=50>>50 bills.
2. He loses 10 bills, so now he has $1000 / $20 - 10 = <<1000/20-10=49>>49 bills.
3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for something, so he uses 49 / 2 = <<49/2=24.5>>24.5 bills. Since he can't use half a bill, let's assume he uses 24 bills and gives the last one back to the dealer or round up and uses 25 bills.
4. Thomas then triples his money. Since he originally had 50 bills with $1000, tripling his money would result in 50 x 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 bills.
5. Finally, Thomas converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find out how many 5 dollar bills he has, we divide the total number of bills he has by the number of 5 dollar bills in each bill: 150 / 1 = <<150/1=150>>150.

1. The teacher uses a 5-inch piece of chalk each day. Since he tries to use only 20% of it each day, the amount of chalk used per day is 5 inches × 0.2 = <<5*0.2=1>>1 inch.
2. On Monday, the teacher used up 45% of the chalk. So, the amount of chalk used on Monday is 5 inches × 0.45 = <<5*0.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
3. The difference between the chalk used on Monday and the regular daily usage is 2.25 inches - 1 inch = <<2.25-1=1.25>>1.25 inches.
4. The teacher can recycle the chalk when it becomes smaller than 2 inches. So, if the teacher uses 1.25 inches on Tuesday, he will still have 3.75 inches left. He will need to recycle the chalk when he uses more than 2.5 inches of the remaining chalk.
5. To find how many more days the teacher can use this piece of chalk before recycling, we need to divide the remaining chalk by his daily usage: (3.75 inches) / (1 inch per day) = <<3.75/1=3.75>>3.75 days. However, we should round this down to the nearest whole number as we cannot use a fraction of a day.

The final answer is the teacher can use this piece of chalk for 3 more days before recycling it.</s>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.

4. However, we just counted 12 boys and 4 girls on varsity, so there are a total of 16 students on the varsity team.

5. Since we want to find out how many students are NOT on the varsity team, we simply need to subtract the number of students on the varsity team from the total number of students in the class.

                 [/INST] Step 1: First, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist fixes in total. We know that the dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 teeth. Therefore, the number of teeth the dentist fixes is: 4 (drilled) + 7 (caps) = 11 teeth.

Step 2: Next, we want to find out what percentage of James' total number of teeth this represents. We have 11 teeth that have been fixed and 30 teeth in total. Therefore, the percentage of teeth that the dentist has fixed is: (11 teeth / 30 teeth) x 100% = 36.67%.

{The final answer is 36.67%}.

However, it's important to note that the percentage value is not typically reported with a decimal point. So, it's more common to report this value as 37%.

So, the dentist fixes 37% of James' teeth.</s>","First find the total number of teeth the dentist caps: 4 teeth + 7 teeth = <<4+7=11>>11 teeth

                    Wendy is five times , as old as Colin will ; be seven years from now. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy , is now. How old is Colin ! now?
                 [/INST] Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. In seven years, Wendy will be five times as old as Colin will be, so we can write this equation: Wendy's age in 7 years = 5 * Colin's age in 7 years

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is then, so we can write this equation: Colin's age in 25 years = (1/3) * Wendy's age in 25 years

3. To find Colin's age now, we need to determine Wendy's age now. Let's call Wendy's current age W and Colin's current age C.

4. In 18 years (which is 7 years plus the difference between Wendy's and Colin's ages in 7 years), Wendy will be five times as old as Colin will be in 7 years. This translates into the equation: W + 18 = 5 * (C + 7)

5. Solving for C: Subtract 7 from both sides, then divide by 4 (since 5 is equivalent to 4 times a number) to get Colin's age in 7 years. Also, subtract 18 from both sides to find Wendy's current age.
C + 7 = W/4
W = 4*C + 7

6. Substituting W back into the second equation: (1/3) * (4*C + 7) = C + 25

7. Solving for C: Multiply both sides by 3, subtract 7 and divide by 3.
C = (4 * C + 7 + 25) / 3
C = (4 * C + 32) / 3
3 * C = 4 * C + 32
C = 32 / (1 - 4/3)
C = 32 / (1/3) * (3/4)
C = 32 * (12/15)
C = 32 * (2/5)
C = 128/5
C = 25.6
Since age cannot be a fraction, this might not make sense, suggesting a mistake in the problem itself.

                 [/INST] To find out how many books Bob can buy per school, we first need to determine how much he spends on books for each school. We know that he spends a total of $27,000 on books and buys 100 books for $500.

First, let's find out how many books Bob can buy with $500:

1. Bob buys 100 books with $500, so the cost of one book is $5.
2. Therefore, the number of books Bob can buy with his total budget of $27,000 is:
   $27,000 / $5 = 5,400 books

Since Bob spends this amount of money among 3 schools, we can find out how many books he buys for each school by dividing the total number of books by the number of schools:

3. Number of books per school = Total number of books / Number of schools
    = 5,400 / 3
    ≈ 1800

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:
{The final answer is: Bob can buy approximately 1800 books per school.}</s>","He spends 27000/3=$<<27000/3=9000>>9000

Let's find out the total number of slices of cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza that her friends will eat:

1. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
2. So, the total number of cheese pizza slices for all her friends is: 6 slices/friend x number of friends.
3. The total number of pepperoni pizza slices for all her friends is: 4 slices/friend x number of friends.

Let's calculate that:
number of friends x 6 slices/friend = total cheese pizza slices
number of friends x 4 slices/friend = total pepperoni pizza slices

Now, let's find the total number of slices needed for both types of pizza:

total cheese pizza slices + total pepperoni pizza slices = total pizza slices

Next, we need to determine how many pies are needed to provide this number of slices for both types of pizza:

We know that:
1 cheese pizza pie = 12 slices
1 pepperoni pizza pie = 8 slices

Let's first find the number of cheese pizza pies needed:
total cheese pizza slices / slices per cheese pizza = number of cheese pizza pies

And let's find the number of pepperoni pizza pies needed:
total pepperoni pizza slices / slices per pepperoni pizza = number of pepperoni pizza pies

Let's calculate that:
(number of friends x 6 slices/friend) + (number of friends x 4 slices/friend) = total pizza slices
number of cheese pizza pies = total cheese pizza slices / 12 slices/pie
number of pepperoni pizza pies = total pepperoni pizza slices / 8 slices/pie

                 [/INST] Let's first find out how many snowballs Jay can make in an hour and a half, which is the time it takes for 2 snowballs to melt.

We know Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour. So, in 1.5 hours (which is 1 hour and 30 minutes or 90 minutes), he can make:

Snowballs in 1.5 hours = Snowballs per hour * Hours
= 20 * 1.5
= 30 snowballs

However, since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, 4 snowballs melt in an hour. So, Jay loses 4 snowballs every hour. In 1.5 hours, he loses:

Lost snowballs = Snowballs lost per hour * Hours
= 4 * 1.5
= 6 snowballs

So, in 1.5 hours, Jay can make 30 snowballs but lose 6 due to melting, resulting in a total of 24 snowballs.

To reach 60 snowballs, Jay needs to make an additional 36 snowballs (60 total snowballs - 24 current snowballs). It takes him 1 hour to make 20 snowballs. So, it will take him an additional 1.5 hours to make the 36 extra snowballs:

Time to make 36 more snowballs = Snowballs to make / Snowballs per hour
= 36 snowballs / 20 snowballs per hour
= 1.8 hours

Adding the 1.5 hours he already spent to make 24 snowballs, Jay will need a total of:

Total time to make 60 snowballs = Time to make 24 snowballs + Time to make 36 more snowballs
= 1.5 hours + 1.8 hours
= 3.3 hours

{The final answer is: It takes Jay 3.3 hours to make 60 snowballs.}</s>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

John's age when Digimon came out = x + 2x = 3x
Jim's age when Digimon came out = x

Now, we know that John is currently 28 years old. This means:

John's age now = 28
 John's age when Digimon came out = 3x

To find Jim's current age, we can set up the equation:

Jim's age now = Jim's age when Digimon came out + (number of years that have passed since then)

We know that:
Jim's age when Digimon came out = x
Number of years that have passed since then = 28 - 3x (since John is now 28)

So,

Jim's age now = x + (28 - 3x)

To find x, we need to solve for it. This can be done by isolating x:

x + 28 - 3x = 0
x = 28/6
x ≈ 4.67

Since ages are whole numbers, it's not possible for Jim to be approximately 4.67 years older than John when Digimon came out. It's more likely that there's a mistake in the problem statement, and John was not twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.

Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of haircut.
Since the cost of haircut is $30 per inch, and the length of her hair decreased from 10 inches to 8 inches, the cost of haircut would be:
$30/inch * (10 inches - 8 inches)

Step 2: Calculate the cost of haircut.
$30/inch * 2 inches = $60

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
The cost of cut and color is the sum of the cost of haircut and the cost of color, which is given to be $40.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate Jen's weekly earnings without the attendance bonus.
Hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Weekly earnings without bonus = Hourly rate * Weekly hours worked
Weekly earnings without bonus = $1.5 * 45 = $67.50/week

Step 2: Calculate Jen's monthly earnings without the attendance bonus for 4 weeks in April.
Monthly earnings without bonus = Weekly earnings without bonus * Number of weeks in a month (April has 4 weeks)
Monthly earnings without bonus = $67.50/week * 4 = $270/month

Step 3: Calculate Jen's additional attendance bonus for complete attendance in April.
Attendance bonus = $10/week * Number of weeks in a month (April has 4 weeks)
Attendance bonus = $10/week * 4 = $40

Step 4: Add Jen's weekly earnings without bonus and her attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April.
Total earnings in April = Weekly earnings without bonus + Attendance bonus

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the earnings from each chore in a two-week period.

- Emptying the dishwasher 6 times: $0.50 x 6 = $3.00 (since he earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, which is more than what he earned from emptying the dishwasher 6 times, we'll consider the laundry chore as done once and focus on the rest of the chores)
- Taking the trash out twice: $0.75 x 2 = $1.50
- Cleaning his room once: $1.50

Step 2: Add the earnings from each chore to find the total amount earned.

Total earnings = $3.00 for laundry (given) + $1.50 for taking out the trash twice + $1.50 for cleaning his room

Total earnings = $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.50 = $6.00

Step 2: At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant and ordered food. So, the number of people at 10:00 is N + 40.

Step 3: Later in the day, twice the number of people who came at 10:00 entered for lunch. So, the number of people for lunch was 2 * (N + 40).

Step 4: By evening, the number of people in the restaurant was 3 times the number of people in the morning. So, 3N is the total number of people by evening.

Step 5: To find the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add the number of people in the morning, the number of people at 10:00, and the number of people for lunch. This gives us the equation: N + (N + 40) + 2 * (N + 40) = 3N.

Step 6: Solving this quadratic equation, we find that N = 20. This gives us the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day: 50 (morning) + 40 (10:00) + 2 * 40 (lunch) = 160.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find out how many pens are in the 5 packs of red pens.
Since each pack contains 5 pens, then 5 packs will contain:
5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens

Step 2: Find out how many pens are in the packs of black pens.
We know that there are twice as many black pens as red pens. So the number of black pens in one pack is:
1 pack red pens * 2 * 5 pens/pack = 10 pens

Step 3: Find out how many pens are in total purchased black pens.
Since there are 5 packs of red pens and twice that number of black pens:
5 packs red pens * 2 * 10 pens/pack = 50 packs black pens * 10 pens/pack = 500 pens

Step 4: Add the number of red pens Alain has (from step 1) to the number of black pens (from step 3).

                 [/INST] Step 1: Let's find the number of bottles of cognac that John bought. We know he bought 10 bottles of scotch, so he bought twice as many bottles of cognac.

Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * Number of bottles of scotch = 2 * 10 = 20 bottles

Step 2: Now, let's find the cost of one bottle of cognac. We know each bottle of scotch costs $60 in total for 10 bottles, so the cost per bottle is $60 / 10 = $6. We're told the bottles of cognac cost 50% more per bottle, so we'll find the cost of one bottle of cognac by adding 50% to the cost of one bottle of scotch.

Cost of one bottle of cognac = $6 + ($6 * 0.5) = $6 + $3 = $9

Step 3: Now that we know the cost per bottle of cognac, we can calculate the total number of bottles and the total cost of both types of alcohol.

Total cost = (Cost of scotch bottles + Cost of cognac bottles)

Total cost = ($600 + (Number of cognac bottles * $9))

Step 4: To find the total cost, we need to calculate the number of cognac bottles once more:

Number of cognac bottles = 2 * Number of scotch bottles = 2 * 10 = 20

Step 5: Now, we can find the total cost:

Total cost = $600 + (20 * $9)

Total cost = $600 + $180

Total cost = $780

{The final answer is $780.}</s>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each

Step 2:On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pines than what he planted on the first day.
10 more White Oaks = 30 White Oaks (20 initial + 10 more)

4. On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 8 gallons.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people (including Fred) showed up for the party.

To find out how much is available for each person during the party, we need to divide the remaining amount by the number of people:

The final answer is: {8 gallons / 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person} However, it's impractical to serve root beer in fractions of a gallon during a party. Therefore, it would be necessary to make or have enough root beer for the guests, or buy more to accommodate everyone's consumption.</s>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.

Step 1: Find out how many fish have red stripes.
One-third of the 66 fish have red stripes, so we calculate this as: 66 * (1/3) = 22 fish
{The number of fish with red stripes is 22.}

Step 2: Find out how many fish have blue stripes.

Step 3: She also had 3 makeup sets, each with 6 eyeshadow colors. So she had 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 eyeshadow colors from the sets.

Step 4: Half of one makeup set was used up, which means she used 1 * 6 = <<1*6=6>>6 eyeshadow colors from one set.

Step 5: After using up half of one makeup set, Amy has 18 - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 eyeshadow colors remaining from the sets.

                    Mattison is 60 inches tall. His two-story house : is 7 times ? as high as ; he is. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is. How ; high is the roof from the second floor's floor in inches?
                 [/INST] To find the height of the roof from thesecond floor's floor, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mattison is 60 inches tall.
2. The two-story house is 7 times as high as Mattison, so its total height is: 60 inches (Mattison's height) x 7 = 420 inches
3. The ceiling height on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so it's: 60 inches (Mattison's height) x 3 = 180 inches
4. The difference between the total house height (420 inches) and the ceiling height on the first floor (180 inches) represents the height of one story and the height of the roof. Since there are two stories and one roof, each story should be half of the height difference, and all together they should be equal to the height difference:

Let's denote the height of each story as x and the height of the roof as y. We have x + y = Total height difference:

x (Story height) = (1/2) * height difference
y (Roof height) = (1/2) * height difference

The difference between the total height (420 inches) and the first floor's ceiling height (180 inches) is 240 inches (420 inches - 180 inches).

So, each story height is half of it, which is: 120 inches (240 inches / 2)

Now we can find the height of the roof by subtracting the story height from the total height to obtain the roof height.

Height of roof = Total height - 2 * (half story height) = 420 inches - 2 * 120 inches = 420 inches - 240 inches = 180 inches

Therefore, the final answer is: The roof is 180 inches high. {The final answer is: The roof is 180 inches high}</s>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

Total miles needed by the first three dogs = 1 mile + 4 miles + 3 miles
Total miles needed by the first three dogs = 8 miles

Now, we find the average miles needed per dog:
Average miles per day for one dog = Total miles needed by all dogs / Number of dogs
Average miles per day for one dog = 8 miles / 4
Average miles per day for one dog = 2 miles

Therefore, the last dog also needs to walk an average of 2 miles per day.

If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to , the market?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the tunas that Deandre caught.
The first tuna weighs 56 kg, the second tuna weighs 46 kg, and the third tuna weighs x kg.
So, the total weight of the tunas is 56 kg + 46 kg + x kg = 102 kg + x kg

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the tunas.
Each kilogram of tuna is sold for $0.50, so the revenue from selling one tuna is its weight in kilograms multiplied by $0.50.
The revenue from the first tuna is 56 kg * $0.50/kg = $28
The revenue from the second tuna is 46 kg * $0.50/kg = $23
To find the revenue from the third tuna, we need to know its weight. Let x = 26, then the third tuna weighs 26 kg, so the revenue from the third tuna is 26 kg * $0.50/kg = $13

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the tunas.
The total revenue from selling all the tunas is the sum of the revenues from each tuna:
$28 + $23 + $13 = $64

                 [/INST] To find Trinity's profit, we first need to determine her selling price. We know that she sells magazines for 11/8 of the price she paid. So:

Selling price = Cost price * (1 + Markup percentage)
             = $72 * (1 + 11/8)

First, let's simplify the fraction 11/8. To do this, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 8 and 11 which is 88.

11 × 7 = 77
7 × 8 = 56
LCM(8,11) = 88

Now we can write the markup percentage as a decimal:

Markup percentage = (11/8) * 100%
                 = (11/8) * 100% * (1/10)
                 = 11/8 * 0.1
                 = 1.375

Now we can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = $72 * 1.375
             = $98.88

To find her profit, we subtract her cost price from her selling price:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price
       = $98.88 - $72
       = $26.88

{The final answer is: $26.88}</s>","Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.

                    question:
                    Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also ! knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?
                 [/INST] To determine how far off Tim was with his guess, let's first calculate the actual number of jelly beans in the container, and then compare that to Tim's guess.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.
Since the jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches, we can calculate the volume of the base as follows:
Volume of base = Side length^2
Volume of base = (6 inches)^2
Volume of base = 36 cubic inches

The total volume of the jar is the volume of the base plus the volume of the height (which is a cube with side length 6 inches):
Total volume = Base volume + Height^3
Total volume = 36 cubic inches + (6 inches)^3
Total volume = 36 cubic inches + 216 cubic inches
Total volume = 252 cubic inches

Step 2: Calculate the number of jelly beans in the jar when packed 100%.
Since each jelly bean occupies .15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans in a jar of volume V is V / .15.

Number of jelly beans when packed 100% = Total volume / Volume of one jelly bean
Number of jelly beans when packed 100% = 252 cubic inches / .15 cubic inches
Number of jelly beans when packed 100% = approximately 1680 jelly beans

Step 3: Calculate the actual number of jelly beans in the jar (accounting for packing efficiency).
Since the packing efficiency is given to be 80%, the actual number of jelly beans in the jar when packed is the number calculated in Step 2 multiplied by the packing efficiency.

Actual number of jelly beans = Number of jelly beans when packed 100% * Packing efficiency
Actual number of jelly beans = 1680 jelly beans * .8
Actual number of jelly beans = approximately 1344 jelly beans

Step 4: Calculate the number of red jelly beans in the jar.
Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar is 30% of the actual number of total jelly beans.

Number of red jelly beans = Actual number of jelly beans * Percentage of red jelly beans
Number of red jelly beans = 1344 jelly beans * .3
Number of red jelly beans ≈ 403 red jelly beans

Step 5: Calculate the difference between the actual number of red jelly beans and Tim's guess.
Difference = |Actual number of red jelly beans - Tim's guess|
{The final answer is: The difference between the actual number of red jelly beans and Tim's guess is approximately 497.}

Tim's guess was approximately 497 red jelly beans short of the actual number in the jar.</s>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

The bus had 20 people initially, and 40 more people entered at the first station. So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60.

Step 2: Find the number of people who entered the bus at the second station.
The problem states that 3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first station entered at the second station. So, the number of people who entered the bus at the second station is 0.75 * 40 = <<0.75*40=30>>30.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people on the bus after the second station.
The number of people on the bus after the second stop is the number of people on the bus after the first stop plus the number of people who entered the bus at the second station. So, the number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90.

Step 4: Find the number of empty seats on the bus after the second station.
The bus has a capacity of 200 people. The number of people on the bus after the second station is 90. So, there are 200 - 90 = <<200-90=110>>110 empty seats on the bus after the second station.

How much did Pauline spend on all visits to ; the museum?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the cost of one visit initially and after 5 years.
The cost of one visit initially is $2. After 5 years, the cost has increased by 150%. To find the cost of one visit after 5 years, we need to calculate 150% of the initial cost:

Cost of one visit after 5 years = Initial cost * 1.15
Cost of one visit after 5 years = $2 * 1.15
Cost of one visit after 5 years = $2.30

Step 2: Calculate the number of visits Pauline made during the 8 years (3 visits per year for 5 years + 3 extra visits).
Total number of visits = Visits in first 5 years + Extra visits
Total number of visits = 3 visits/year * 5 years + 3 visits
Total number of visits = 15 visits + 3 visits
Total number of visits = 18 visits

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by Pauline on all visits.
Total amount spent = Cost of one visit * Total number of visits
Total amount spent = $2.30/visit * 18 visits
Total amount spent = $41.40

{The final answer is: Pauline spent $41.40 on all visits to the museum.}</s>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes for everyone to try the escape room, we first need to determine how many students can try the escape room in an hour and how many groups of students can try in an hour.

1. The number of students who can try the escape room in an hour is 8 (since only 8 students can try at a time).
2. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, in an hour, the school can accommodate 2 groups (since 60 minutes / 45 minutes = 1.33 hours per group, but we can only schedule complete groups).
3. Since there are 10 students in each grade, the total number of students who can try the escape room in a year is 70 students (10 students per grade for 7 grades).
4. To find out how long it takes for all the students to try the escape room, we divide the total number of students who will try the escape room in a year by the number of students who can try in an hour.
5. So, the calculation is: 70 students / 2 students per hour = 35 hours

Therefore, it would take 35 hours for everyone to try the escape room. However, since this is a simplification assuming that everyone would fit into the school calendar in exactly one year, it's important to consider holidays, weekends, and breaks. The actual implementation would depend on the school's schedule.

{The final answer is: It would take approximately 35 hours for everyone to try the escape room under ideal conditions.}</s>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as x. According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. thus, the longer piece has a length of 4x.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can write the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Now we need to solve for x, and therefore find the length of the shorter piece. To do this, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

5x = 40

Next, we need to divide both sides by 5 to isolate x:

x = 8

Now we know that the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. To find the length of the longer piece, we can substitute x back into the expression we found earlier:

The longer piece has a length of 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet

Therefore, the final answer is: The longer piece is 32 feet long.</s>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.

                    A basic manicure starts at $35 while a pedicure starts at $40. A certain salon offers 20% off if : you get both. Suppose Karen chooses to do both and would also like to : add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail. How much would she pay in all?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of a manicure and pedicure separately.
- Manicure cost: $35
- Pedicure cost: $40

Step 2: Calculate the discounted cost of getting both a manicure and pedicure.
First, find the discounted cost of each service:
- Manicure discounted cost: $35 * (1 - 0.2) = $28
- Pedicure discounted cost: $40 * (1 - 0.2) = $32

Then, add the discounted cost of both services:
- Total discounted cost: $28 (manicure) + $32 (pedicure) = $60

Step 3: Calculate the cost of adding nail art on each finger.
- Cost per nail: $3
- Number of nails on hands: 10 (for both hands)
- Total cost of nail art: $3 * 10 = $30

Step 4: Find the total cost for Karen.
Total cost = Total discounted cost (manicure and pedicure) + Cost of nail art
Total cost = $60 + $30 = $90

{The final answer is: $90}</s>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of subscriptions for the 12-issue magazines ""x"". Then, the number of subscriptions for the 6-issue magazines is ""y"", and the number of subscriptions for the magazine that sends 4 times the amount of issues as the 6-issue magazine is ""z"".

Susan gets x * 12 issues from the 12-issue magazines every year, and y * 6 issues from the 6-issue magazines. The number of issues she gets from the 4x subscription is 4 * y * 6.

We want to find the total number of issues she receives every year, as well as the total number of subscriptions she has:

Total issues = x * 12 + y * 6 + 4 * y * 6

We know that x + y + z = 3 (since Susan has three subscriptions), and we also know that y = z/2 (since the 6-issue magazine sends half the number of issues as the magazine that sends 4 times the number of issues as the 6-issue magazine).

Substituting y = z/2 into our equation, we get:

Total issues = x * 12 + (z/2) * 6 + 4 * (z/2) * 6

Notice that (z/2) * 6 is the same as z * 3 (each term in the product is multiplied by 3). So our equation becomes:

Total issues = x * 12 + z * 6 + 4 * z * 3

Since we want to find the total number of subscriptions, we need to find the values of x and z. We can set up another equation using the information given about the number of subscriptions:

x + y + z = 3
x + (y/2) + z = 3

Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 we get:

2x + y + 2z = 6
x + y + z = 3

Now we can solve for y using the first equation:
y = 3 - x - z

Substituting y into the second equation:
x + (3-x-z) + z = 3

Simplifying and solving for x:
x + 3 - x - z + z = 3
z = 3

Substituting z = 3 into our equation for y:
y = 3 - x - 3
y = -x

We can now find the total number of issues:
Total issues = x * 12 + (-x) * 6 + 4 * (-x) * 6
Total issues = x * 12 + 6x * 6 + 24x * 6
Total issues = x * (12 + 6 + 24)
Total issues = x * 32

Since Susan gets a total of 3 * 12 = 36 issues a year, we know that:

x * 32 = 36 * 3
x * 32 = 112
x = 112 / 32
x = 3.5

Since it's not possible to have a fractional number of subscriptions, there is a mistake in the problem statement. It's not clear how Susan can have 3.5 magazines. {The final answer is undefined due to an error in the problem statement.}</s>","She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues

Charlie charges $80 per hour for standard lessons. So, the amount he earns from 4 standard lessons is:
$80/hour * 4 hours = $320

Step 2: Determine the amount Charlie earns for his veteran lessons.
Charlie reduces his rate by 25% for veteran lessons, which means he charges 75% of his standard rate. So, the amount he earns from 1 veteran lesson is:

Step 2: Next, the problem states that ""this year, she has written 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written."" From this, we can infer that the number of novels Regina has written this year is equal to 3/4 * X, where X is the number of novels she wrote last year.

Step 3: Substituting X = 9 into the equation, we have:

Number of novels written this year = 3/4 * 9

Step 4: Solving the equation:

Number of novels written this year = 6 * 3/4
Number of novels written this year = 1.5 * 3
Number of novels written this year = 4.5 * 1
Number of novels written this year = 4.5

Since it's not possible to write a fraction of a novel, we must assume that there's a mistake in the given information or in the calculation. Let's assume the number of novels Regina wrote this year is a whole number close to 4.5. Then:

Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day * 3 days
Total distance covered in 3 days = 3600 km

2. Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered:
Total distance between Alaska and Texas = 6000 km
Percentage covered = (Distance covered / Total distance) * 100%
Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100%

                 [/INST] Let's call the number of grapes Madeline ate ""x"". Since her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass, the number of grapes he used is 5x. The mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, so the number of grapes used in the pies is 4 * 12 = 48.

The total number of grapes at the beginning can be found by adding the grapes Madeline ate, the grapes used to make the juice, and the grapes used to make the pies:

x (Madeline's grapes) + 5x (brother's grapes) + 48 (pies)

To find the total number of grapes, we need to solve for x:

x + 5x + 48 = x + 5x + total number of grapes
6x = total number of grapes
total number of grapes = 6x

The question states that the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie. Therefore, the total number of grapes needed for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48. We know that this number was used up, so the total number of grapes at the beginning is:

total number of grapes = Madeline's grapes + brother's grapes + grapes used for pies
total number of grapes = x + 5x + 48
total number of grapes = 6x + 48

Subtracting the number of grapes used for the pies from the total number of grapes, we get the number of grapes Madeline ate:

x = (total number of grapes) - (grapes used for pies)
x = (6x+48) - 48
x = 6x

Solving for x:

x = 0 or x = 8

Since there cannot be a negative number of grapes, we can conclude that Madeline ate 8 grapes at the beginning. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning was:

total number of grapes = x + 5x + 48
total number of grapes = 6x + 48

                    question:
                    Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.  The pasta costs $1.00 a box, and he spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for the gruyere cheese. ;  How much . money does Bud spend on making macaroni and cheese in one year?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost of macaroni and cheese.
The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box. Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we'll find out the weekly cost of pasta:
Weekly pasta cost = $1.00

Step 2: Find the weekly cost of cheese.
Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese and twice that amount for gruyere cheese. So, we need to calculate the weekly cost of gruyere cheese first:
Cost of gruyere cheese per week = 2 * $3.00 = $6.00
Then, add the cost of cheddar cheese and gruyere cheese to find the total weekly cheese cost:
Weekly cheese cost = $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $9.00

Step 3: Calculate the weekly cost of macaroni and cheese.
Weekly macaroni and cheese cost = Weekly pasta cost + Weekly cheese cost
Weekly macaroni and cheese cost = $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00

Step 4: Find out how many weeks there are in a year.
There are approximately 52 weeks in a year.

Step 5: Calculate the annual cost of macaroni and cheese.
Annual cost = Weekly cost * Number of weeks per year
Annual cost = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

{The final answer is: $520.00}</s>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00
The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00 and the gruyere cheese is $6.00 for a total of 1+3+6 = $<<1+3+6=10.00>>10.00
There are 52 weeks in a year and he makes this dish once a week so it will cost him 52*10 = $<<52*10=520.00>>520.00 in one year

                 [/INST] To find out what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms on average, we first need to determine how many classrooms they can clean in an hour and then calculate how many classrooms they can clean in a day and finally find out what percentage of their working hours is spent on cleaning.

1. It takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom. Therefore, they can clean 60 classrooms in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
2. They have an 8-hour workday, so they can clean 480 classrooms in a day (since they can clean 60 classrooms in an hour and there are 8 hours in a day).
3. The school has 80 classrooms. Since they can clean 480 classrooms in a day, they will need 5.83 days on average to clean the entire school (since 80 divided by 480 equals 0.1667, and 5.83 days is approximately how many days 0.1667 multiplied by 5 will give us).

However, we were asked for the percentage of their working hours that is spent cleaning classrooms on average, not the number of days. To find this percentage, we can divide the number of hours spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of hours worked in a day.

4. Since they can clean 60 classrooms in an hour and there are 60 minutes in an hour, they can clean one classroom in one minute. Therefore, they spend 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), cleaning each classroom.
5. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms on average, divide the number of hours spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of hours worked in a day. So, 0.25 hours spent cleaning classrooms divided by 8 hours worked in a day equals 0.03125, or approximately 3.13%.

Therefore, the final answer is that the custodian spends approximately 3.13% of their day cleaning classrooms on average.</s>","They have to clean 16 classrooms a day because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16

                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine the number of books that can be held on each shelf of one bookcase.
- Middle shelves can hold 10 books each.
- Bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf: 10 books * 2 = 20 books.
- Top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf: 20 books - 5 = 15 books.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books that can be held on one bookcase.
- One bookcase has one middle shelf with 10 books, one middle shelf with 10 books, one bottom shelf with 20 books, and one top shelf with 15 books.
- The total number of books that can be held on one bookcase is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 45 books.

Step 3: Determine how many bookcases are needed to hold all of Elly's books.
- Elly has 110 books.
- To find out how many bookcases she needs, divide the total number of books by the number of books that can be held on one bookcase: 110 books / 45 books/bookcase = 2.44 bookcases. Since she cannot have a fraction of a bookcase, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. So, she will need 3 bookcases to hold all of her books.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of eggs that Rose bought.
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs.
- The cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40.
- Therefore, the cost of 5 dozens of eggs is 5 * $2.40 = $12.00.

Step 2: Find the number of eggs that Rose will sell.
- Rose will sell eggs in lots of 3.
- So, the number of eggs she will sell from one dozen is 12/3 = 4.
- Since she bought 5 dozens of eggs, she will sell 5 * 12 = 60 groups of 3 eggs.

Step 3: Find the revenue that Rose will get from selling the eggs.
- The price of 3 eggs is $1.
- So, the revenue from selling one group of 3 eggs is $1.
- The revenue from selling all 60 groups of 3 eggs is 60 * $1 = $60.

Step 4: Find Rose's profit.
- The cost of the eggs that Rose bought is $12.00.
- The revenue from selling the eggs is $60.
- Therefore, Rose's profit is $60 - $12.00 = $48.00.

{The final answer is $48.00}</s>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.

1. Skyler has 100 hats in total.
2. Half of the hats are red, so we find the number of red hats by calculating 1/2 * 100 = 50.
3. After finding the number of red hats, there are 100 - 50 = 50 hats remaining.
4. Next, we find the number of blue hats, which is 3/5 of the remaining hats: 3/5 * 50 = 30.
5. After finding the number of red and blue hats, there are 50 - 50(red) - 30(blue) = 20 hats remaining.
6. These last 20 hats are white hats.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Find the cost of one stick of jerky without the discount.
Since one bag contains 30 sticks and costs $18.00, the cost of one stick is:

Cost per stick = Cost per bag / Number of sticks per bag
Cost per stick = $18.00 / 30 sticks
Cost per stick = $0.60

Step 2: Determine the discount Archie gets on one bag.
The discount on one bag is $3.00.

Step 3: Find the cost of one stick of jerky with the discount.
To find the new cost per stick with the discount, divide the cost of one bag after the discount by the number of sticks per bag:

Cost per bag after discount = Cost per bag - Discount
Cost per bag after discount = $18.00 - $3.00
Cost per bag after discount = $15.00

Cost per stick with discount = Cost per bag after discount / Number of sticks per bag
Cost per stick with discount = $15.00 / 30 sticks
Cost per stick with discount = $0.50

Step 4: Convert the cost of one stick with discount to cents.
Cost per stick with discount = $0.50
Cost per stick with discount = $0.05 x 10

First, let's find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly in total. She needs to answer 70% of the total questions. The first test has 70 questions, so she needs to answer 70% * 70 = 49 questions correctly on the first test.

She already answered 60% * 70 = 42 questions correctly on the first test. So she still needs to answer 49 - 42 = 7 more questions correctly.

Since the second test has 40 questions, we can find out how many questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test by dividing the number of questions she needs in total by the number of questions on the second test and rounding up to the nearest whole number:

Total questions she needs to answer correctly = 49
Questions on the first test = 70
Questions on the second test = 40

Number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test = (Total questions she needs to answer correctly - Questions answered correctly on the first test) / Questions on the second test

Number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test = (49 - 42) / 40

Number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test = 0.475

Since she needs to answer a whole number of questions correctly, she needs to answer at least 1 more question correctly than this fraction would suggest.

Number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test = ceiling(0.475 * 40)

Number of questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test = ceiling(19)

She makes some strawberry . cubes, and a number of blueberry . cubes equal to 5 times the : number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?
                 [/INST] Let's begin by determining the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes. Then we can use that information to find the number of blueberry cubes.

1. We know that Mary makes a certain number of blueberry cubes that is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S.
2. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes is given by the equation: B = 5S - 4
3. We also know that Mary makes a total of 116 ice cubes. Since each ice cube can be either a strawberry cube or a blueberry cube, this means that: S + B = 116
4. To find S, we can use trial and error or solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination methods. However, since the problem does not require a complex solution, we can use a simple approach.
5. Let's assume that Mary makes an even number of strawberry cubes to make the problem simpler. Since the number of blueberry cubes is always smaller than the number of strawberry cubes, this assumption is valid.
6. Let's test out the possibility that she makes 56 strawberry cubes. That would imply that she makes: B = 5(56) - 4 = 232 - 4 = 228 blueberry cubes
7. However, this result is not valid since there is no way to make that exact number of blueberry cubes.
8. Let's retry with the next odd number of strawberry cubes, which is 57. That would imply that she makes: B = 5(57) - 4 = 273 - 4 = 269 blueberry cubes
9. This time, the result is a valid number, but it is more than the total number of ice cubes. We should go back and check the previous assumption.
10. Instead of assuming an even number of strawberry cubes, let's try an odd number that is close to but less than double the total number of ice cubes (232). The smallest odd number that satisfies this condition is 113. That would imply that she makes: S = 113, B = 5S - 4 = 557 - 4 = 553 blueberry cubes
11. However, 113 strawberry cubes make a total of 113 * 2 = 226 ice cubes, which is still less than the total number of ice cubes. We should continue increasing the number of strawberry cubes until we find the correct solution.
12. The next odd number is 115. That would imply that she makes: S = 115, B = 5S - 4 = 575 - 4 = 571 blueberry cubes
13. This time, the number of blueberry cubes is 571, which is equal to the difference between the total number of ice cubes and the number of strawberry cubes: B = 116 - S = 116 - 115 = 1 blueberry cube less than the total number.
14. Therefore, Mary makes one less blueberry cube than the calculated number. To find the actual number of blueberry cubes, we need to decrease the number of blueberry cubes by 1: B = 570

{The final answer is: Mary makes 570 blueberry cubes.}</s>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

3. Now, we need to find how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to get 30 customers.
   Number of calls for 30 customers = 30
   Number of calls for 30 customers = 30 * 25
   Number of calls for 30 customers = 750 calls

Therefore, the final answer is: Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.</s>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the number of candles for each type and the number of rooms for each type.
There are 8 rooms in total. We'll divide them into 2 groups: 4 rooms for small candles and 4 rooms for medium candles.

 small candles: 4 rooms * (4 small candles per room) = 16 small candles
 medium candles: 4 rooms * (5 medium candles per room) = 20 medium candles

Step 2: Calculate the number of candles for the entire family.
There are 4 people in the family, so they have 4 flashlights. Since there are no candles mentioned for the flashlights, we won't count them as candles.

Step 3: Combine the number of candles and flashlights.
We have calculated the number of candles, but we also have flashlights, which weren't included in our calculation. Since there is 1 flashlight per person, and there are 4 people, there are 4 flashlights in total. We ignore these flashlights in our calculation since they don't provide any additional light.

Total number of candles: 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles

Step 4: The final answer.
{The final answer is}: They are using 36 candles when the lights go out.</s>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.
For every person there is 1 flashlight, 1 x 4 people = <<1*4=4>>4 flashlights.
Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.

1. We know that there are half as many robots as helmets. Let R be the number of robots, and H be the number of helmets. Then, R = 0.5 * H.
2. We also know that there are half as many helmets as footballs. Let F be the number of footballs. Then, H = 0.5 * F.
3. We are given that there are 20 helmets. We can use this information to find the number of footballs: H = 20, so F = 2 * H = 2 * 20 = 40.
4. Now, we can find the number of robots using the relationship from step 1: R = 0.5 * H = 0.5 * 20 = 10.
5. To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we simply add up the number of robots, helmets, and footballs: Total items = R + H + F = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70.

So, {The final answer is 70}.</s>","If the number of helmets was 20, there were 2 footballs/helmet * 20 helmets = <<20*2=40>>40 footballs

                 [/INST] To determine how much longer it takes for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we first need to find out how much time difference there is between the two.

1. The coat of varnish takes 7 minutes to dry with the old varnish.
2. The coat of varnish takes 12 minutes to dry with the new varnish.

Subtracting the drying time with the old varnish from the drying time with the new varnish, we get:

12 minutes (new varnish) − 7 minutes (old varnish) = 5 minutes longer for one painting.

Now, let's calculate how long it would take for 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry:

1. It takes 5 minutes longer for one painting with the new varnish.
2. So, it takes 7 minutes + 5 minutes = 12 minutes for one painting with the new varnish.
3. To find the total drying time for 6 paintings, multiply the drying time per painting by the number of paintings: 12 minutes/painting × 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

Lastly, to find the difference in the drying times between the old and new varnishes for 6 paintings, subtract the drying time with the old varnish from the drying time with the new varnish:

1. It takes 72 minutes to dry 6 paintings with the new varnish.
2. It takes 42 minutes (6×7 minutes) to dry 6 paintings with the old varnish.
3. The time difference is 72 minutes (new varnish) - 42 minutes (old varnish) = 30 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we first need to determine how much water each group of plants requires daily, and then sum up the water requirements of all groups.

Let's start by finding out how much water is needed for 4 plants that require half a cup daily and for 8 plants that require one cup daily:

- Half a cup of water is required for each of 4 plants, so 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water are needed for these plants.
- One cup of water is required for each of 8 plants, so 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water are needed for these plants.

Now let's find out how many cups of water are required for the remaining plants:

Since there are 20 plants in total, 4 plants have 2 cups of water, and 8 plants have 8 cups of water, there must be 12 plants with 0.25 cup of water each. So, 12 * 0.25 = 3 cups of water are needed for these plants.

Finally, to find the total amount of water required daily, we add the water quantities for all groups:

Total cups of water = Water for 4 plants requiring half a cup + Water for 8 plants requiring one cup + Water for other plants
                             = 2 + 8 + 3
                             = 13 cups of water

                 [/INST] Let's denote the total distance Phineas needs to cover to return home as D. Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, the distance on land is D/2 and the distance in water is D/2.

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to cover the distance on land is: time on land = distance on land / hopping speed = D/2 / 20

Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so the time it takes him to cover the distance in water is: time in water = distance in water / swimming speed = D/2 / 10

The total time it takes Phineas to return home is the sum of the time he spends hopping and swimming: total time = time on land + time in water = (D/2 / 20) + (D/2 / 10)

To simplify this expression, we can find a common denominator for the terms in the fractions: total time = (D/40 + D/40) = D/20

                 [/INST] Let's denote the cost of an additional phone as x. According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as an additional phone, so the cost of the main phone is 2x.

The problem states that the cost of the main phone plan is $20. So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 5x = $20.

Combining like terms, we get that 6x = $20.

Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for x, so x = $3.33 (approximately).

Now, we can determine the cost of the whole phone plan by finding the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of the 5 additional phones:

Main phone cost = 2x = 2 * $3.33 = $6.67 (approximately)
Cost of additional phones = 5 * x = 5 * $3.33 = $16.65 (approximately)
Total cost = $6.67 + $16.65 = $23.32 (approximately)

                    Alicia's clothes have to be sent to the dry cleaners weekly.  Her weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  If they charge her $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per ; skirt and ? $8.00 per pair of pants, how much does she spend on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate how much she spends on each type of item per week, and then multiply that by the number of weeks.

Weekly Cost for Blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00
Weekly Cost for Skirts: 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00
Weekly Cost for Pants: 2 pants * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Now, let's calculate the total weekly cost:
Total Weekly Cost = Weekly Cost for Blouses + Weekly Cost for Skirts + Weekly Cost for Pants
Total Weekly Cost = $25.00 + $6.00 + $16.00 = $47.00

Finally, to find the total cost for 5 weeks:
Total Cost for 5 Weeks = Total Weekly Cost * Number of Weeks
Total Cost for 5 Weeks = $47.00 * 5 = $235.00

{The final answer is $235.00}.</s>","The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00
The one skirt she has costs $6.00 to dry clean

In one week she spends 25+6+16 = $<<25+6+16=47.00>>47.00 on dry cleaning
Over 5 weeks, she will spend 5*47 = $<<5*47=235.00>>235.00 on dry cleaning

                 [/INST] First, we need to determine John's new speaking speed after training. We know that his starting speed is 150 WPM and that his new speed is 2.5 times faster. So:

New speaking speed = Starting speed * 2.5
New speaking speed = 150 WPM * 2.5
New speaking speed = 375 WPM {This is the rate at which John can now speak}

Next, we need to calculate the total number of words John will speak in 10 pages. We know that each page contains 450 words:

Total words = Number of pages * Words per page
Total words = 10 pages * 450 words
Total words = 4500 words

Now we can calculate the time it takes John to speak these words at his new speaking speed:

Time = Total words / Speaking speed
Time = 4500 words / 375 WPM
Time = 12 hours / 0.001157 WPM (we need to convert WPM to hours for our unit to match. 1 hour = 3600 seconds, and 1 minute = 60 seconds and 1 WPM = 1 word per second, so 1 WPM = 1/60000 hours)
Time = 11,576,000 seconds

Finally, we'll convert that time into minutes and hours:
Total time = Seconds / 60
Total time = 11,576,000 seconds / 60
Total time = 1,929,333 minutes
Total time = 32,155.55 hours

However, it appears this answer is incorrect, as it's a much longer time than we'd expect for speaking 10 pages. There might be an error in the problem or in the calculations. With the information given, it seems impossible to accurately determine the time it would take John to speak 10 pages with his new speed. {The final answer is not possible to determine with the given information.}</s>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes

On the second day, there were 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 people.

On the third day, there were twice as many people as on the second day. So, there were 2 * 70 = <<2*70=140>>140 people.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people present each day for the rest of the week.

Each day from the fourth to the seventh day, Conor saw an average of 60 people.

The first three days had the following number of people: 50, 70, and 140.
The rest of the week consisted of 60 people per day for 4 days.

Total number of people = Initial three days + People during the rest of the week

                 [/INST] To find the number of popcorn kernels that popped during each time interval and the final number of popcorn pieces, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped.
2. In the second 30 seconds, since they popped three times as fast as the first 30 seconds, 20 × 3 = 60 kernels popped.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate was four times the initial rate. Since 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds, in the third 30 seconds, 20 × 4 = 80 kernels popped.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate was half the rate of the previous 30 seconds. Since 80 kernels popped in the third 30 seconds, in the last 30 seconds, 80 × 0.5 = 40 kernels popped.
5. After taking the pan off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds popped from the residual heat. So, 40 × 0.25 = 10 additional popcorn pieces.

Hence, the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat is: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces.

{The final answer is 210 pieces}</s>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.

How ? many lemons will Tim need?
                 [/INST] Step 1: Determine how many lemons are needed to produce 1 cup of juice.
We know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. So, the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon of lemonade is:

1 gallon = 160 cups (since 1 gallon = 160 cups of water)
1 cup lemon juice = 6 lemons

So, the number of lemons needed for 1 gallon of lemonade is:

1 gallon = 160 cups
1 cup lemon juice = 6 lemons
Number of lemons for 1 gallon = (total cups of juice needed for 1 gallon) / (cups of juice produced by 6 lemons)
Number of lemons for 1 gallon = 160 cups / 1 cup = 160 lemons

Step 2: Calculate how many lemons are needed to make 4.5 gallons of lemonade.
Tim wants to make 4.5 gallons of lemonade for the pool party:

Lemmas for 4.5 gallons = Number of lemons for 1 gallon × Number of gallons
Lemmas for 4.5 gallons = 160 lemons/gallon × 4.5 gallons
Lemmas for 4.5 gallons = 720 lemons

Step 3: Calculate how many lemons are needed to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart.
Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart:

Lemmas for extra tart gallon = Number of lemons for 1 gallon × 2
Lemmas for extra tart gallon = 160 lemons/gallon × 2
Lemmas for extra tart gallon = 320 lemons

So the total number of lemons Tim needs is:
Total lemons = Lemmas for 4.5 gallons + Lemmas for extra tart gallon
Total lemons = 720 + 320
Total lemons = 1040. {The final answer is 1040 lemons}.

Therefore, Tim will need 1040 lemons to make 5 gallons of lemonade for the pool party and an extra gallon that is twice as tart for his best friend Allen.</s>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice.

                 [/INST] Let's denote the number of red blocks as R, the number of blue blocks as B, and the number of yellow blocks as Y. We know that:

B = 4
Y = 2B
R + B + Y = 32

First, let's find the number of yellow blocks in terms of blue blocks:

Y = 2B

Now we can substitute Y into the equation:

R + B + 2B = 32

Combine the terms with B:

3B = 32 - R

Next, we'll solve for B in terms of R:

B = (32 - R) / 3

Since B must be an integer number of blocks (blue blocks must fit in the tower as well), we need to find values of R that make B an integer.

Let's try different values of R and see if we get an integer value for B:

R = 4: B = (32 - 4) / 3 ≈ 10.67 (not an integer)

R = 12: B = (32 - 12) / 3 ≈ 6.67 (not an integer)

R = 16: B = (32 - 16) / 3 = 10

So, when R = 16, B = 10, Y = 2B = 20, the total number of blocks is B + Y + R = 10 + 20 + 16 = 36 (not 32). This means that the given information doesn't result in a valid number of blocks in the tower.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the distance Elvis traveled during each part of the journey.

The first part of the journey is 5 hours long, so the distance Elvis drove west is:
Distance_west = Time_west * Speed
Distance_west = 5 hours * 18 mph
Distance_west = 90 miles

The second part of the journey is 8 hours long, so the distance Elvis drove east is:
Distance_east = Time_east * Speed
Distance_east = 8 hours * 18 mph
Distance_east = 144 miles

Step 2: Determine Elvis's current position
Since Elvis started driving west and ended up driving east, his final position is the point where he turned around (which is the middle point of a line segment connecting his starting position and the end of the second part of his journey).

Let's call the length of the entire journey the ""Total Distance."" We know the distances of the two parts of the journey, so we can set up an equation and solve for the Total Distance:

Distance_west + Distance_east = Total Distance
90 miles + 144 miles = Total Distance
234 miles = Total Distance

So, the total distance traveled during the entire journey is 234 miles. Since Elvis traveled 90 miles west and 144 miles east, his current position is:

Current_position = Initial_position + Distance_east

Since Elvis started driving west, his initial position was moving away from his house. If we assume his house is the origin (0 miles), his current position would be:

Current_position = 90 miles (west) + 144 miles (east) = 234 miles

Step 3: Find the current distance from Elvis's house
Since his current position is 234 miles, the distance from his house is:

Distance = Absolute_value(Current_position)
Distance = Absolute_value(234 miles)
Distance = 234 miles

{The final answer is: Elvis is currently 234 miles from his house.}</s>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles

1. Calculate the depreciation in the first year: 
   Depreciation = Initial cost * Depreciation rate
   Depreciation = $9000 * 30%
   Depreciation = $9000 * 0.3 = $2700
   So, the boat was worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300 after the first year.

2. Calculate the depreciation in the second year:
   Depreciation = Previous value * Depreciation rate
   Depreciation = $6300 * 30%
   Depreciation = $6300 * 0.3 = $1929
   So, the boat was worth $6300 - $1929 = $4371 after the second year.

3. Calculate the depreciation in the third year:
   Depreciation = Previous value * Depreciation rate
   Depreciation = $4371 * 20%
   Depreciation = $4371 * 0.2 = $874.2

Helen paid $80 for one night at the hotel. Therefore, the cost of one night at the hotel is $80.

Step 2: Find the cost of a bus trip.
Every bus trip cost 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel. So, the cost of one bus trip is 0.1 * $80 = $8.

                 [/INST] Step 1: We know that Mazie gave all of her marbles, which is 52, to the twins, Dallas and Darla.

Step 2: After giving away some marbles, Dallas had a total of 21 marbles. This means that the number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas is the difference between the total number of marbles Mazie had and the number of marbles Dallas had after giving some away.

Step 3: To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Dallas, we can calculate the difference between the total number of marbles Mazie had and the number of marbles Dallas had after giving some away:

Number of marbles Mazie gave to Dallas = Total marbles Mazie had - Marbles Dallas had after giving some away
= 52 marbles - 21 marbles
= 31 marbles

Step 4: Since Dallas and Darla are twins, they should have received an equal number of marbles from Mazie. Thus, Mazie gave 31 marbles to Dallas, which means she gave 52 - 31 = {21 marbles} to Darla.

                 [/INST] Step 1: Calculate the cost of the adult tickets.
Since there are parents in the family, but the question doesn't specify how many, we'll assume there are two parents for now. This means there are 2 adult tickets.

Cost of adult tickets = Number of adults * Cost of an adult ticket
Cost of adult tickets = 2 * $12
Cost of adult tickets = $24

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the child ticket.
There is no mention of how many children are in the family, so we'll assume there's one child in this scenario.

Cost of child ticket = Cost of a child ticket
Cost of child ticket = $8

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the popcorn.
There are 2 popcorns purchased.

Cost of popcorn = Number of popcorns * Cost of a popcorn
Cost of popcorn = 2 * $3
Cost of popcorn = $6

                 [/INST] To find the force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car with the luggage and the children.

1. The weight of the car is 1200 pounds.
2. There is luggage in the car that weighs 250 pounds.
3. John has two young children, each weighing 75 pounds.

So, the total weight of the car, luggage, and children is: 1200 lbs (car) + 250 lbs (luggage) + 150 lbs (children) = 1600 lbs

Now, the problem states that the force needed to move the car is 1% of its total weight. So we calculate this force as follows:

Force = Total weight * Percentage
Force = 1600 lbs * 1%

Converting percentage to decimal for calculation:
Force = 1600 lbs * 0.01

Force = 16 pounds

Therefore, {The final answer is: John needs to push with a force of 16 pounds to move the car.} Note that this may not be practically possible due to friction and other factors, but this is the amount of force mentioned in the problem.</s>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

                 [/INST] To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy for decorating his backyard fence, we first need to find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Given that the length is 20 feet and width is 15 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as:

Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
          = 2 * (35 feet)
          = 70 feet

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper for decorating his backyard fence for his birthday party.

{The final answer is: James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.}</s>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16

Given that Mia is 40 years old, we can calculate Emma's age as:

Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years

Now that we know their ages, we can find their average age:

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2

Plug in the values:

Average age = (40 + 56) / 2

Perform the arithmetic:

Average age = 96 / 2

Divide:

Average age = 48

So, the average age of Mia and Emma is 48 years. {The final answer is 48}.</s>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

1. Tom found 214 seashells, and 67 of them were cracked. So, the number of good seashells Tom found is:
   Good seashells Tom found = Total seashells Tom found - Cracked seashells Tom found
   = 214 - 67
   = 147

2. Nancy found 432 seashells, and 67 of them were cracked. So, the number of good seashells Nancy found is:
   Good seashells Nancy found = Total seashells Nancy found - Cracked seashells Nancy found
   = 432 - 67
   = 365

3. Benny found 86 seashells, and since the problem doesn't mention any cracked seashells for Benny, it is assumed that all of his seashells are good. Therefore, the number of good seashells Benny found is:
   Good seashells Benny found = Total seashells Benny found

                    An . ice cream truck is traveling through a neighborhood. Children from various homes have started chasing the truck and, by the time the truck has reached the end of the first street, there are 5 children it. .

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many , children are now following the truck?
                 [/INST] Step 1: On the first street, there are 5 children following the ice cream truck.

Step 2: On the second street, each child is joined by another child, so the number of children doubles for every child. Since there are currently 5 children, this means there are now 5 * 2 = 10 children following the truck.

Step 3: On the third street, each of the original 5 children is joined by an additional 2 children. So, each of the 5 children brings 2 new children to the group, so 5 * 2 = 10 new children. That's a total of 10 * 3 = 30 new children. Since there were previously 10 children following the truck, this brings the total number of children to following the truck to 10 (original children) + 30 (new children) = 40 children.

{The final answer is 40 children following the ice cream truck.}</s>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

On the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.
After the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.

1. First, let's find out how many meals Mamou has given out so far. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday.
2. We can calculate the total number of meals given out by adding the number of meals given out on each day: 64 + 30 + 48 = 132 meals.
3. Finally, to find out how many meals are left to distribute, we subtract the number of meals given out from the total number of meals: 1,360 - 132 = 1,228 meals.

1. The value of one quarter is 25 cents. So, James has 1 quarter, which is worth 25 cents.

2. He has 2 nickels. The value of one nickel is 5 cents. So, the total value of the nickels he found is 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 cents.

3. He has 7 dimes. The value of one dime is 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes he found is 7 * 10 = <<7*10=70>>70 cents.

4. Therefore, the total amount of money James has is the sum of the values of the quarters, nickels, and dimes: 25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (2 nickels) + 70 cents (7 dimes) = <<25+10+70=105>>105 cents.

{The final answer is 105 cents}.</s>","First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents

1. Brother A has 2 younger sisters.
2. All sisters are the same age, which is 16.
3. Brother B is 12 years old.
4. Brother B is half the age of Brother A.

From statement 4, we can write the equation: Brother A = 2 * Brother B

We know Brother B is 12 years old, so:

Brother A = 2 * 12 = 24

Now we have the ages of two brothers. However, we have three sisters, and their age is given as ""all sisters are the same age, which is 16."" This statement contradicts the information that's been given about their ages and the relationship between brothers and sisters.

Based on the given information, it is impossible to determine the total age of all the siblings.

{The final answer is: The total age of all the siblings is undetermined with the given information.}</s>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

1. Meditation:
   - She meditates for 15 minutes when she wakes up and 15 minutes before she goes to sleep.
   - So, she meditates for 30 minutes twice a day.
   - In 5 days a week, she spends 30 minutes * 5 = <<30*5=150>>150 minutes on meditation.

2. Yoga:
   - She practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, she spends 60 minutes * 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes on yoga practice per week.

3. Total time spent on meditation and yoga practice per week:
   - Meditation: 150 minutes
   - Yoga: 300 minutes
   - Total: 450 minutes

4. Total time spent on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks:
   - 4 weeks have 4 * 7 = <<4*7=28>>28 days (since there are 7 days in a week).
   - So, she spends 450 minutes/week * 4 weeks = <<450*4=1800>>1800 minutes or 30 hours on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks.

{The final answer is 30 hours.}</s>","She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night for a total of 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes

If she uses 11 small shirts, ? 8 medium, and ! 6 large shirts, how many square feet is the quilt?
                 [/INST] To find the total area of the quilt, we first need to calculate the area of each type of shirt that Octavia will use and then add them together.

1. Calculate the area of small shirts:
   * There are 11 small shirts.
   * Each small shirt has an area of 3 square feet.
   * So, the area of small shirts = Number of small shirts * Area per small shirt
   * Area of small shirts = 11 * 3
   * Area of small shirts = 33 square feet

2. Calculate the area of medium shirts:
   * There are 8 medium shirts.
   * Each medium shirt has an area of 4 square feet.
   * So, the area of medium shirts = Number of medium shirts * Area per medium shirt
   * Area of medium shirts = 8 * 4
   * Area of medium shirts = 32 square feet

3. Calculate the area of large shirts:
   * There are 6 large shirts.
   * Each large shirt has an area of 6 square feet.
   * So, the area of large shirts = Number of large shirts * Area per large shirt
   * Area of large shirts = 6 * 6
   * Area of large shirts = 36 square feet

4. Add the areas of all shirts to find the total area of the quilt:
   * Total area of quilt = Area of small shirts + Area of medium shirts + Area of large shirts
   * Total area of quilt = 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet

Step 2: Since a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, we can calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower by adding 50% of the small sunflower's seeds: 36 seeds * 1.5 = 54 seeds.

Step 3: To find the total number of sunflower seeds altogether, we just need to add the number of seeds in both small and large sunflower: 36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds.

                 [/INST] Let's call ""x"" the height of Jackie before the summer. we are given that:

1. Jackie grew 3"" during the summer, so we have x < (x + 3)
2. Jackie is now 2"" shorter than Anne, and Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne's height is x < 2 * Albert's height
3. Albert is 36"" tall, so Albert's height is 36""

From points 2 and 3, we know that x < 2 * 36 = 72

Now let's find Jackie's height before the summer from the given information:

1. Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne: x < 72
2. Jackie grew 3"": x = x + 3

We can set up an equation to find the value of x:
x + 3 < 72
x < 69
x = x + 3

Subtracting 3 from both sides:
x < 66

However, this value doesn't quite work because it would mean Jackie was shorter than Albert before the summer, which contradicts the problem statement.

- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- With the buy one get one 50% off deal, Jake pays for one T-shirt at the full price, and gets the second one for half the price.
- So, the cost of two T-shirts is: $8 (for the first T-shirt) + $4 (for the second T-shirt) = $12.

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price of the shoes that Jake bought.
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoe has a discount of 40%.
- Discounted price of the shoes = Original price - (Discount percentage * Original price) = $40 - (0.4 * $40) = $40 - $16 = $24.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store.
- Jake spends $12 on T-shirts.
- Jake spends $24 on shoes.

Ryan earns $6 per week. So, his earnings for 3 weeks is:
$6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Step 2: Subtract the amount Ryan spent on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends.
He spent $1.25 on each ice cream cone, so the total amount spent on ice cream is:

So, the amount of money left for movie tickets is:
$18 (total earnings) - $5 (ice cream) = $13

Step 3: Determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining amount.
Each movie ticket costs $6.50. So, the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy is:
$13 / $6.50/ticket = 2 tickets (approximately)

Since Ryan can only buy 2 tickets with the remaining amount, we cannot buy tickets for all 4 friends this time. {The final answer is 2 movie tickets}.</s>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

                    Ellen and her sister, Lani, went to the mall to buy ; presents for their mom. Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. ? Lani bought a pair of sunglasses at $30 and two ! bathrobes at $100 each. How much did they spend in all?
                 [/INST] To find out how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the gifts they bought for their mom.

First, let's calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Leggings: $100
- Photo frame: $5
Total cost for Ellen: $105

Next, let's calculate how much Lani spent:
- Sunglasses: $30
- Bathrobe 1: $100
- Bathrobe 2: $100
Total cost for Lani: $230

Now we can add up the total costs for both sisters to find out how much they spent in all:
$105 (Ellen) + $230 (Lani)

The final answer is: {$335}</s>","Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.
Two bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.
So, Lani spent $30 +$200 =$<<30+200=230>>230.
Therefore, they spent $105 + $230 = $<<105+230=335>>335 in all.

So the total weight in pounds for 1 jar is 2 lbs (passion fruit) + 1.5 lbs (jackfruit) + 2 lbs (honey) = 5.5 lbs.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of making 1 jar in dollars. Here we'll find the cost of fruits and the cost of honey, then add them together.

- Passion fruit cost: 2 lbs * $6/lb = $12
- Jackfruit cost: 1.5 lbs * $8/lb = $12
- Honey cost: 2 lbs * $10/lb = $20

Total cost to make 1 jar = $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

Step 3: Calculate the profit per jar by subtracting the cost from the selling price. Profit per jar = $50 (selling price) - $44 (cost) = $6

Step 4: Calculate the profit from selling 10 jars. Profit = $6/jar * 10 jars = $60

                 [/INST] To find out how much money Matthew would earn if he agrees to the buyer's offer, we first need to calculate the total revenue he would get from selling each half of his collection at their respective prices.

First, let's determine how many toy soldiers Matthew would sell in each half of the collection. Since he has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers and the buyer wants to pay differently for each half, we'll split the collection into two equal parts of 6 toy soldiers each.

Now, we'll calculate the revenue Matthew would get for each half of the collection:

For the first half (6 toy soldiers), the buyer would pay $5 per toy:
Revenue for the first half = Number of toys * Price per toy
Revenue for the first half = 6 * $5
Revenue for the first half = $30

For the second half (6 toy soldiers), the buyer would pay $7 per toy:
Revenue for the second half = Number of toys * Price per toy
Revenue for the second half = 6 * $7
Revenue for the second half = $42

To find the total revenue Matthew would earn if he agrees to the buyer's offer, we simply add the revenues from both halves:

Total revenue = Revenue for the first half + Revenue for the second half
Total revenue = $30 + $42
Total revenue = $72

{The final answer is $72}.</s>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes is: 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes Nate fills in each day.
Nate fills in 9 holes a day.

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes filled in during one day and one night cycle.
Nate fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night, so the net number of holes filled in each day is: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day.

Step 4: Calculate how many days it takes to fill in all the holes.
To find the number of days needed to fill in all the holes, divide the total number of holes by the number of holes filled each day: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Step 5: Calculate how many weeks it takes to fill in all the holes.
Finally, divide the number of days needed to fill in all the holes by the number of days in a week to find the number of weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = approximately 4 weeks and 2 days.

How many beakers did Igor lose?
                 [/INST] Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
2. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he had 16 * 0.5 = 8 test tubes.
3. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he had 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.
4. Igor had picked up the correct number of beakers, so he had 7 beakers.
5. However, we know that in total, Igor had placed 29 items on the lab bench.
6. Let's set up an equation to represent the number of each item on the lab bench: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 29 items
7. To find the number of beakers Igor lost, we need to find the difference between the number of beakers he picked up and the number he actually put on the lab bench: 7 (beakers picked up) - 7 (beakers placed on the bench) = 0. However, we know this answer is not correct since we know Igor lost some beakers.
8. Let's assume Igor picked up one extra Petri dish by mistake, which would account for the difference between the number of items he gathered and the number he put on the bench. Then the equation becomes: 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 17 Petri dishes = 29 items
9. Since we know there are 3 items in a set (test tube, beaker, and Petri dish), and Igor picked up 29 items in total, we can divide the total number of items by 3 to find out how many sets he picked up: 29 items / 3 items per set = 9.67 sets.
10. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, this means that Igor must have picked up an extra beaker along with the extra Petri dish, making the actual number of beakers Igor lost unknown.

The final answer is: We cannot determine how many beakers Igor lost.</s>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

Step 2: The problem states that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket as there are in the first basket. So, we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in second basket = Number of eggs in first basket * 2
= 10 eggs * 2
= 20 eggs

Step 3: To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs in each basket.

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in first basket + Number of eggs in second basket
= 10 eggs + 20 eggs

If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes . did Vanessa take to complete her part?
                 [/INST] To find out how long it takes Vanessa to complete her part of the race, we need to find her running speed and then use that to calculate her time for running 4 miles.

1. We know that Aaron runs one mile in 16 minutes. So, Vanessa runs one mile in:
   Vanessa's running speed = Aaron's running speed * 0.5
   = 16 minutes * 0.5
   = 8 minutes

2. Now we know that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron can in one hour. Since Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, we can calculate how far Vanessa can run in an hour:
   Aaron's distance in an hour = 4 miles
   Vanessa's distance in an hour = 2 * 4
   = 8 miles

3. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron in the same amount of time it takes Aaron to run one mile, we can find Vanessa's running speed for one mile:
   Vanessa's running speed for one mile = Aaron's running speed * 2
   = 16 minutes * 2
   = 32 minutes/mile

4. We need to find how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles. To find that, we'll use her running speed:
   Vanessa's time for 4 miles = 4 miles * her running speed for one mile
   = 4 miles * 32 minutes/mile
   = 128 minutes

5. Finally, we need to convert that time to minutes:
   Vanessa's time for 4 miles = 128 minutes = 128 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 7680 seconds
   Number of minutes in 7680 seconds = 7680 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 128 minutes.

So, the final answer is: {Vanessa took 128 minutes to complete her part of the race}.</s>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.

                 [/INST] To find out how many feet of line the caretaker needs to buy in total, we first need to calculate how many feet of line he needs based on the current length of the dock.

1. We know that the caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
2. The dock currently measures 200 feet long.
3. Therefore, the caretaker needs 200 feet of line for the existing dock (200 x 3 = 600 feet).
4. We also know that the caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.
5. To find out how many more feet of line the caretaker needs to buy, we subtract the amount of new line he currently has from the amount he needs for the existing dock.
6. So, the caretaker needs (600 - 6) = 599.5 feet of new line (rounding up to the nearest whole foot).

{The final answer is: 600 feet of line (for the existing dock), plus 601 feet of new line = 1201 feet in total.}

Alternatively, if we want to express the answer as the difference between the amount of line needed for the dock and the amount the caretaker currently has, we could have calculated it as follows instead:

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue per reservation.
Revenue per reservation = $10 (food) + $5 (wine) = $15

Step 4: Calculate the weekly revenue from food and wine sales if they are open 2 days a week and get 6 reservations per night.
Number of reservations per week = 6 reservations/night * 2 nights/week = 12 reservations/week

                 [/INST] To find out how much the vendor sold each watermelon for, we first need to find out the cost price of each watermelon and then add the profit percentage to it.

1. First, let's calculate the cost price of each watermelon:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total cost of $80.
   So, the cost price of each watermelon is:
   Cost price of each watermelon = Total cost of all watermelons / Number of watermelons
   Cost price of each watermelon = $80 / 50
   Cost price of each watermelon = $1.6

2. Next, we calculate the selling price of each watermelon by adding the profit percentage to the cost price:
   Profit percentage = 25%
   Profit amount = Cost price of each watermelon * Profit percentage
   Profit amount = $1.6 * 0.25
   Profit amount = $0.4
   Selling price of each watermelon = Cost price + Profit amount
   Selling price of each watermelon = $1.6 + $0.4
   Selling price of each watermelon = $2

Therefore, the final answer is: Each watermelon was sold for $2.</s>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

                 [/INST] To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, we first need to find out how old he is now, and then add the number of years in question.

1. We know that James was born when John was 19.
2. James is now twice as old as Dora, who is turning 12 in 3 years. So the current age of James is 2 * (Dora's age + 3).
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32.

Let's denote the current age of John's youngest son as Y. In 3 years, his age will be Y + 3.

We need to calculate the value of Y.

4. Given that James is currently twice as old as Dora, who is turning 12 in 3 years, we can find the current age of James as: James = 2 * (Dora's age + 3)
5. Dora's age can be found by subtracting the number of years until she turns 12 from the age at which she will turn 12 in 3 years: Dora's age = 12 - 3

So,
James = 2 * (12 - 3 + 3)
James = 2 * (12 + 3)
James = 2 * 15
James = 30

Therefore, since James was born when John was 19, the current age of James is: James = 30.

Now, we can determine the current age of John's youngest son by subtracting the number of years John was between the births of James and the youngest son:

Youngest Son's Age = 32 - (19 for James' birth)
Youngest Son's Age = 13

Since the youngest son is currently 13 years old:

Y = 13

Finally, we can find the age of the youngest son in 3 years:

Y + 3 = 16

{The final answer is: John's youngest son will be 16 years old in 3 years.}</s>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old

1. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange. So, she peels one orange every 3 minutes.
2. The number of oranges Ana can peel in an hour is the number of minutes in an hour divided by the number of minutes it takes her to peel one orange:
   Oranges Ana can peel in an hour = Minutes in an hour / Minutes to peel one orange
   = 60 minutes / 3 minutes
   = 20 oranges

3. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange. So, she peels one orange every 4 minutes.
4. The number of oranges Jane can peel in an hour is the number of minutes in an hour divided by the number of minutes it takes her to peel one orange:
   Oranges Jane can peel in an hour = Minutes in an hour / Minutes to peel one orange

                 [/INST] Let's assume that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. This is a common assumption since chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4.

First, let's find the number of chickens based on the total number of legs and the number of legs per animal:

1. Total number of legs = 20 animals * (number of legs for chickens + number of legs for cows)
2. Total number of legs = 20 * (2 + 4) = 20 * 6 = 120 (but we know there are only 70 legs)

We made an error in our calculation. The actual calculation should be:

Total number of legs = 20 animals * 2 legs per chicken = 40 legs per chicken * 20 chickens = 80 legs

However, there are only 70 legs, so 10 legs are missing, which is equal to 5 chickens. Therefore, there are actually 15 chickens and 5 cows.

The error in our initial assumption led us to incorrectly believe there were 20 chickens. Our final answer is:

Step 2: Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
Total slices = Number of pizzas * Number of slices per pizza
Total slices = 7 * 8
Total slices = 56

Step 3: Since Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, we need to find out how many slices each person gets. We know that there are 4 people, including Henry.

Step 4: To calculate how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:
Slices per person = Total slices / Number of people
Slices per person = 56 / 4

Step 5: Simplify the fraction:
Slices per person = 14

Step 6: However, we cannot divide the pizzas exactly into 14 slices. So, we need to check if they can share the last 2 slices. Since there are only 2 people remaining after Henry gets his share (1 pizza per person and 1 slice for Henry), they can share those last 2 slices.

Step 7: Thus, each of Henry and his 3 friends will get 13 slices and the last 2 slices will be shared between the remaining 2 people.
