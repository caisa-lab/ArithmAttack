Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**1. Find the number of eggs left after Janet eats breakfast.**

* Start with the total eggs: 16 eggs/day
* Subtract the eggs she eats: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs

**2. Calculate how much she makes at the farmers' market.** 

* She sells the remaining eggs: 13 eggs 
* Price per egg: $2/egg
* Total earnings: 13 * $2  = $26


**The final answer is:** $26.
