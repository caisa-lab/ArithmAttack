                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks ; lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes ? muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells ? the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day ! at the farmers' market?<end_of_turn>
 * * *


Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of eggs left after Janet's breakfast:** 
   *  Eggs laid - Eggs eaten = Eggs left
   * 16 - 3 = 13 eggs 

**2. Calculate the number of muffins Janet bakes:**
   * Eggs left / muffins per muffin = Number of muffins

**3. Calculate the number of eggs left after baking muffins:**
   * Eggs left – muffins baked = Eggs left 

**4.  Calculate the money Janet makes from selling the eggs:**
   * Number of eggs left * price per egg = Daily earnings


Let me know if you'd like to work through the rest of the problem. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

                    A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that , much white fiber.  How many bolts ; in total does it take?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the quantities needed:**
   - Blue fiber: 2 bolts
   - White fiber: Half of the blue fiber, so 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt.
   
2. **Calculate the total fiber needed:**
   - Total fiber = Blue fiber + White fiber 
   - Total fiber = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
   - Total fiber = 3 bolts

{The final answer is 3 bolts} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate the new value of the house.**

*  Old value: $80,000
*  Repairs: $50,000
*  New value: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

**Step 2: Determine the gain in value.**

*  New value: $130,000
*  Old value: $80,000
*  Gain: $130,000 - $80,000 = $50,000

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

*  Gain: $50,000
*  Initial investment: $80,000 
*  Profit: $50,000


 {The final answer is $50,000} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock ! is 20 chickens?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total feed needed for the first two meals:**
   * Morning meal: 15 cups
   * Afternoon meal: 25 cups
   * Total: 15 + 25 = 40 cups 

**2. Consider the final meal:**
   * Since she feeds the chickens in three meals, we know that the final meal needs to supplement the first two. 
   * Total feed needed: 40 cups

 
**The final answer is: 40 cups** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the price of each discounted glass:**
   -  60% of $5 is (60/100) * $5 = $3. 

2. **Calculate the cost of the discounted glasses:**
   -  The price of each discounted glass is $3.
   -   Since Kylar wants to buy 16 discounted glasses, the total cost is 16 * $3 = $48.

3. **Calculate the final total cost.**
   -  The total cost for all glasses is $48.


**Final Answer: Kylar needs to pay $48 for 16 discounted glasses.**<end_of_turn><eos>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

**Solution:**

1. **Charleston's sheep:** Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, who has 20 sheep.  So Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.
2. **Toulouse's sheep:** Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, who has 80 sheep. So, Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.
3. **Total sheep:** To find the total number of sheep, we add the sheep for each location: 20 + 80 + 160 = 260 sheep 
 
{The final answer is 260 sheep.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total download time before the restart:**
   * Carla downloads 2 GB/minute.
   * The file size is 200 GB.
   * So, the total download time before the restart is = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes.

**2. Calculate the time spent on the restart:**
   * The restart takes 20 minutes.

**3. Calculate the remaining download time:**
   *  This is the time Carla needs to download the file after the restart.


**4. Calculation of the total download time**
   * 100 minutes (before restart) + 20 minutes (restart) = 120 minutes 

**5. Final answer**

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Distance traveled in the first leg:**

*   **Distance = Speed x Time** 
*   Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours 
*   Distance = 180 miles

**2. Distance travelled in the second leg (with traffic):**

*   **Time = 2 hours** 
*   **Distance = Speed x Time**
*   **Distance = 0 mph x 2 hours**
*   **Distance = 0 miles**

**3. Distance travelled in the third leg (after traffic):**

*   **Time = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours**
*   **Distance = Speed x Time**
*   **Distance = 30 mph x 2 hours**
*   **Distance = 60 miles**

**4. Distance travelled in the last leg (at 80 mph):**

*   **Time = 4 hours - 2 hours - 60 miles = 2 hours** 
*   **Distance = Speed x Time**
*   **Distance = 80 mph x 2 hours**
*   **Distance = 160 miles**

 

**5. Total Distance travelled:**

*   **Total Distance = 180 miles + 0 miles + 60 miles + 160 miles**

 
**6. Total Distance from the start**

*   **Total Distance = 180 Miles + 60 Miles + 160 Miles**

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate regular earnings:**

* Regular hourly rate: $10
* Regular hours worked: 40 hours
* Regular earnings: $10/hour * 40 hours = $400

**2. Calculate overtime hours:**

* Total hours worked: 45 hours
* Regular hours worked: 40 hours
* Overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

**3. Calculate overtime pay:**

* Overtime rate: $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour
* Overtime hours: 5 hours
* Overtime earnings: $12/hour * 5 hours = $60

**4. Calculate total earnings:**

**Here's how to approach the problem:**

1. **Calculate Yearly Profit:**
   *  Revenue from selling lemons: 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.50 per year
   *  Total yearly profit: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year.

2. **Calculate Break-Even Point:**  
   *  The cost to plant the tree is: $90
   *  The cost to water and feed each year is: $3 
   *  Total yearly costs: $90 + $3 = $93.

3. **Determine Yearly Earnings to Break-Even:**
   * Carlos needs to earn $7.50 per year to cover the costs and start making a profit. 

4. **Calculate Number of Years to Reach Break-Even:**  
   * For the number of years Carlos needs to make a profit, we will subtract the total cost from the projected yearly profit.




{The final answer is 1 year} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

**Solution:**

1. **Let's use variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Calculate sales at the green house:** 
    * She sold 1/3 * x  vacuums at the greenhouse.

3. **Calculate the number sold at the red house:** 
    * She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners than at the green house, so she sold 1/3 * x + 2 vacuums at the red house.

4. **Calculate the number of vacuums remaining after the greenhouse and the red house sales:** 
    * Total vacuums sold: (1/3 * x) + (2 + 1/3 * x)
    * Remaining vacuums:  x - ( ( 1/3 * x) + (2 + 1/3 * x) ) = x - (1/3 * x) -2 - (1/3 * x)

5. **Set up the equation:**
    *  We know Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
      * x - (1/3 * x) - 2 - (1/3 * x) = 5 

6. **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: (2/3 * x) - 2 = 5
    * Add 2 to both sides: (2/3 * x) = 7
    * Multiply both sides by 3/2 : x = 7 * (3/2) 
    * Simplify: x = 10.5 

7. **Final answer:** 
    {The final answer is 10.5 }



<end_of_turn><eos>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10
Then add two to figure out how many vacuum cleaners she had before visiting the red house: 10 + 2 = <<10+2=12>>12

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Students enrolled in contemporary:**

*  20% of 20 students = (20/100) * 20 = 4 students

**2. Students remaining after contemporary:**

*  20 students - 4 students = 16 students

**3. Students enrolled in jazz:**

*  25% of 16 students = (25/100) * 16 = 4 students

**4. Students enrolled in hip-hop:**

*  16 students - 4 students = 12 students

**5. Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop:**

*  (12 students / 20 students) * 100% = 60%



{The final answer is 60% }<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

If the merchant is looking to maximize profit at the end of ! this month by making a choice, ; how much profit would this be?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to break down the solution:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* The merchant has a financial decision to make about purchasing either jewelry ($5,000) or electronic gadgets ($8,000). 
* He wants to maximize his profit.
* Market fluctuations (2.5% increase in jewelry, 1.2% increase in gadgets) are in play.

**2. Calculating Expected Profit**

* **Jewelry Scenario:**
   * Current value of jewelry: $5,000
   * Increase due to market: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125 
   * Expected value of jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
* **Electronic Gadgets Scenario:**
   * Current value of gadgets: $8,000
   * Increase due to market: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96
   * Expected value of gadgets: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

**3. Comparing Expected Values**

* Now we have the expected value of both jewelry and electronic gadgets after the market increase.

**4. Determining the Best Choice**

* Compare the expected values of both purchases and find the one that results in a higher expected profit

**5. Final Answer**

{The final answer is that the merchant should buy the electronic gadgets because the expected value is higher. }



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these steps further! <end_of_turn><eos>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125
If he purchases electronic gadgets, he will make a profit of 1.2% which is $8000*(1.2/100) = $<<8000*(1.2/100)=96>>96
If he wants to maximize profit, since $125 > $96, he will choose to purchase jewelry, thereby making a profit of $<<125=125>>125

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

* We have two trains traveling.
* Both trains cover a certain distance westward in the first day.
* They continue traveling northward the next day, covering more distance.

**Step 2: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' be the distance traveled westward by the first train. 
* Let 'y' be the distance traveled westward by the second train.

**Step 3: Set up Equations**

 We know the following:
* Day 1:  x + y = 80  (Each train travels 80miles westward)
* Day 2:     The trains cover different distances northward.

**Step 4: Determine the Northward Distance**

* We know the trains traveled 150 miles northward.
 * Note:  this could not be a direct relationship; we need an independent relationship or information to determine the distances. 

**Step 5: Solve for Distances**

As of now, we do not have enough information to determine the distance traveled by each train northward. 

**Step 6: Additional Information**



 
{The final answer is that we need more information to solve for the distances both trains travel northward}    
<end_of_turn><eos>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate Jill's earnings from teaching:**

* **Hourly rate:** $20
* **Hours per week:** 35
* **Weekly earnings:** $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week
* **Annual earnings (teaching):** $700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

* **Weekly earnings:** $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week
* **Annual earnings (coaching):** $450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

**3. Calculate Jill's total annual salary**

Here's the breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the number of omelets per week**
* Claire makes 3 eggs per omelet.
* She makes one omelet each time.  
* So, she makes 3 eggs/omelet * 1 omelet/morning = 3 eggs/day. 
* In a week (7 days), she will consume 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs. 

**2. Calculate the total eggs for four weeks**
* 21 eggs/week  * 4 weeks = 84 eggs


 **3.  Calculate the number of dozens of eggs**
* One dozen eggs is 12 eggs.
* She needs 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens of eggs.




{The final answer is 7 dozens of eggs.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time Marissa spent walking the first 6 miles.**
   - She took 1 hour for the first 4 miles, so she took 1 hour * 4 miles = 4 miles
2. **Calculate the total time Marissa spent on the hike.**
   - So far, she walked for 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.
3. **Calculate the time Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.**
   - To have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, she needs to cover the remaining distance in 12 miles / 4 miles/hour = 3 hours.
4. **Determine the speed needed for the remaining distance.**
   - She needs to cover 3 hours worth of distance at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

{The final answer is 4 miles per hour}


<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

* The question states that the orange drink's initial composition is two-thirds water. *(Initial composition calculation)*
* The pineapple drink's initial composition is three-fifths water. *(Initial composition calculation)*
* The question asks about the water content in the mixture, after taking into account the spillage. *(Final calculation)*



**Detailed Solution:**

1. **Determine the initial amount of water in the orange drink:**
    * The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the initial amount of water is (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters (rounded to two decimal places). 

2. **Determine the initial amount of water in the pineapple drink:**
    * The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the initial amount of water is (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters.

3. **Calculate the total initial amount of water in both drinks:**
   * Total initial water = 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters.

4. **Calculate the amount of water present in the mixture before the spill:**
   * The total mixture is 15.67 liters. 
  


**Final answer:** {The amount of water in the mixture before the spill is 15.67 liters}.
<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

1. **Raymond's age when his son was born:**  
   - Raymond was 23 years old when his son was born.

2. **Raymond's age when Samantha was born:**
   - Raymond was 6 years younger than Samantha when she was born.
   - Samantha's age when her son was born = 23 - 6 = 17 years old.

3. **Raymond's age when Samantha was born:**
    - Since Raymond was 6 years younger than Samantha when she was born.
    - Raymond was 17 - 6 = 11 years old when Samantha was born

4. **Find the difference between Raymond's son's birth year and Samantha's birth year:**
   - Raymond's son was born in the year 11 years.

*I need help with this problem to determine how to solve it.*

Here's what we know:

* **Chicken Meal:** $12
* **Milk:** 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
* **Apples:** 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6
* **Total Paid:** $50


Let's work through the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the total cost of the milk, apples, and chicken.**
  * $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

**2. Find the cost of the pizza.**
  * $50 - $33 = $17 

**3. Find the cost of one box of pizza.**

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of cartons Cynthia needs.**

* Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream per night, and she buys cartons with 15 servings.
* To find out how many cartons she needs for 60 days, we divide the total number of servings by the servings per carton: 60 days * 1 serving/day = 60 servings
* To find how many cartons she needs, divide the total servings by the servings per carton: 60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cartons.** 

* The cost of each carton is $4.00
* The total cost is the cost of each carton multiplied by the number of cartons needed: $4.00/carton * 4 cartons = $16.00


**Step 3: Complete the solution.**

* Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.



{The final answer is $16.00}<end_of_turn><eos>","Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream

                    question:
                    Henry made two ; stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first ? stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. . How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

**2. Relate the Information**

* We are given that the first stop was 20 miles from the start. 
* The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.
* The total distance was 60 miles.


**3. Write an Equation**

To start, we can use a combination of this knowledge to write a simple equation:

* Distance traveled to first stop + distance traveled to second stop = total distance

This can be written as: 20 + x = 60 

**4. Solve for 'x'**

* Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
  x + 20 - 20 = 60 - 20
*  Simplify:
  x = 40

**5. Answer the Question**

* Henry traveled **40** miles between his first and second stops.
{The final answer is 40} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.

However, she has to choose between the boots ; and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of , heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?<end_of_turn>


Here's the solution:

**Step 1: Find the cost of the second pair of heels.**

* The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which costs $33.
* Therefore, the second pair of heels costs 2 * $33 = $66.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of heels.**

* The two pairs of heels together cost $33 + $66 = $99.

**Step 3: Determine the cost of the boots.**

* The two pairs of heels cost five dollars less than the boots.
* Therefore, the boots cost $99 + $5 = $104.


{The final answer is $104} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Understand the Given Information:**

* Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11. 
* Their total age now is 162.


**2.  Set up the Ratio Variables:**
*  Let Darrell's age be represented by 7 * x and Allen's age be represented by 11 * x. 

**3. Express the Total Age in terms of Variables:** 
 We know their total age is 162, so we can write the equation:
 7x + 11x = 162

**4. Solve for x:**
* Combine the terms: 18x = 162
* Divide both sides by 18: x = 9

**5. Determine Darrell's Age:**

* Darrell's age (7x) = 7 * 9 = 63
* 

**6. Determine Allen's Age:**

* Allen's age (11x) = 11 * 9 = 99

**7. Calculate Allen's Age in 10 Years:**
*  Allen's age in 10 years = 99 + 10 = 109 {The final answer is} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

Here is how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost per yogurt:**

*  Divide the price of the deal by the number of yogurts in the deal: $5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt.

**2. Calculate the total cost of the yogurts for 30 days:**
*   Multiply the cost per yogurt by the number of yogurts Terry eats per day: $1.25/yogurt * 2 yogurts/day = $2.50 per day

**3. Calculate the total cost for 30 days:**
*   Multiply the daily cost by the number of days: $2.50/day * 30 days = $75.00

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the distance per run:**

* John runs half as much the other days as his first day which is 3 hours.
* Distance run on the other two days: 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours per day

**2. Determine the total distance ran in one day**

* Total distance per run: 3 hours 
 
**3. Calculate the total time for running in a week**

* Total hours: 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 6 hours

**4. Calculate his pace (speed) in miles per hour**

If she can skip at 3 : miles per hour, how many miles ? can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine Dana's running speed:**

* Dana is four times faster than she can walk. 
*  If she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is 3 * 4 = 12 miles per hour.

**2. Determine Dana's walking speed:**

* Dana can run four times faster than she can walk, and we know her running speed is 12 mph.
*  Therefore, her walking speed is 12 / 4 = 3 mph.  

**3. Calculate Dana's time spent running:**

* Dana spends one-third of 6 hours on running.
*  Time spent running = (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours

**4. Calculate Dana's time spent walking:**

* Dana spends two-thirds of 6 hours on walking.
* Time spent walking = (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours

**5. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled while running:**

* Distance traveled while running =  Speed * Time
* Distance traveled while running = 12 mph * 2 hours = 24 miles 

**6. Calculate Dana's total distance traveled while walking:**

* Distance traveled while walking = Speed * Time
* Distance traveled while walking = 3 mph * 4 hours = 12 miles

**7. Calculate Dana's total distance travelled:**

* Total distance = Distance traveled while running + Distance traveled while walking 
* Total distance = 24 miles + 12 miles = 36 miles

 
{The final answer is 36 miles} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

                    ? According to ! its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie ! target is 2000 and ? you have already . consumed 1800 calories?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate calories per serving:**

* The question states that a single serving of chips contains 250 calories.

**2. Calculate total calories from 5 servings:**

*  The bag has 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories.
* Total calories from 5 servings = 5 servings * 250 calories/serving = 1250 calories.

**3. Determine the calories remaining:**

* You have a target of 2000 calories and have consumed 1800 calories.
* Calories remaining = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories.

**4. Calculate how many grams of chips you can eat**

* You will eat 200 calories. 
* The bag contains 1250 calories.


**5. Find out the calorie content of these grams**

This is tricky as we don't know the calorie content per gram of the chips! {The final answer is}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

<end_of_turn><eos>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate ! the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the ! three days.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday:**

* 2/5 of the number of articles on Monday.
* We need to calculate the fraction of articles written on Tuesday first. So we have that 2/5 of 5 articles is (2/5) * 5 = 2 articles.

**2. Calculate the number of articles written on Wednesday:**

* Twice the number of articles written on Tuesday.
* So, she wrote 2 * 2 = 4 articles on Wednesday.

**3. Calculate the total number of articles written by Meredith:**

* Total articles written = Monday articles + Tuesday articles + Wednesday articles.
* So, she wrote 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles.

**4. Calculate the total time spent on writing articles**

* Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.
*  Total hours = 11 articles * 4 hours/article
*  Total hours = 44 hours

{The final answer is 44 hours} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.

If she had 23 post-it notes . remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used at the coffee shop.**

* Candice used 220 post-it notes on her coffee cups.
 
**2. Calculate the total number of Post-it notes used before going to the store.**

*  Candice had 80 post-it notes to start.
*  She added 23 unused notes. 
*  Total post-it notes used: 80 + 23 = 103  


**3. Find the number of Post-it notes she bought.**

* To find this, subtract the total Post-it notes used from the number of notes she started with.
*  Post-it notes purchased: 80 - 103 = -23


Since the result is negative, this means Candice had to buy some Post-it notes and is not possible.

 


{The final answer is nil} 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

**Solution:**

1. **Cost of blue ties:**
   *  We are given that John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.
   *  Therefore, the cost of blue ties is $200 / 40 = 5 dollars.

2. **Cost of red ties:**
   *  Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties. 
   *  This means the cost of red ties is 1.50 times the cost of blue ties.   
   *  So, the cost of red ties is $5 * 1.50 = $7.50.


3. **Total cost of ties:**
   *  We need to find the total cost of all the ties.
  *  The total cost is the sum of the cost of blue ties and the cost of red ties.
   * 	Total cost = $5 + $7.50 = $12.50


**Therefore, {The final answer is} $12.50**            


<end_of_turn><eos>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60

*For clarity, I'll list each step with a brief description. 

**1. Calculate the number of units in the building.** 
    * This involves multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

**2. Calculate the total number of occupied units.** 
    * Multiply the number of units in the building by 3/4.

**3. Calculate the number of unoccupied units.** 
    * Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of units in the building.**
   *  Units in the building = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

2. **Calculate the total number of occupied units.** 
   * Occupied units = 120 units * (3/4) = 90 units

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units.** 
   * Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units


 {The final answer is 30 units}

t

Step by step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of dozen eggs:**
   * Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   * There are 12 eggs in a dozen. 
   * Number of dozen eggs = 252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozen eggs

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**
   * Price per dozen = $2 
   * Number of dozen eggs = 21 dozen
   * Weekly earnings = $2/dozen * 21 dozen = $42

{The final answer is $42} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the comic books.**

*  Weight per comic book: 1/4 pound
*  Number of comic books removed: 30 
*  Total weight of comic books: (1/4 pound/comic) * 30 comics = 7.5 pounds

**Step 2: Determine how much weight comes from the toys.**

How much more revenue did the mechanic . earn on the day with higher revenue?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Calculate Revenue from Truck Tires:**

* The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired.
* They repaired 6 truck tires.
* Revenue from truck tires = $60/tire * 6 tires = $360

**2. Calculate Revenue from Car Tires:**

* The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire repaired.
* They repaired 4 car tires.
* Revenue from car tires = $40/tire * 4 tires = $160

**3. Calculate Total Revenue for Thursday:**

* Total revenue from Thursday = Revenue from truck tires + Revenue from car tires 
* Total revenue from Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

**4. Calculate Revenue from Car Tires on Friday:**

* They repaired 12 car tires.
* Revenue from car tires = $40/tire * 12 tires = $480

**5. Calculate Total Revenue for Friday:**

* Total revenue from Friday = Revenue from car tires
* Total revenue from Friday = $480

**6. Determine Revenue Difference**

*  Revenue difference = Total Revenue from Friday - Total Revenue from Thursday 
*  Revenue difference = $480 - $520 = -$40


{The final answer is -$40} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.
On Friday the mechanic charged a total of 12*40 = $<<12*40=480>>480.
Thus, on Thursday, the day with higher revenue, the mechanic had 520-480 = $<<520-480=40>>40 more revenue than on Friday.

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

1. **Find the number of adopted kittens Patchy has.**
   - Patchy had thrice the number of adopted kittens as Trixie.
   - Patchy's kittens = 3 * 12 = 36 kittens.

2. **Calculate the total number of kittens from both cat litters.**
   - Total kittens = adopted kittens (from Doubtfire's) + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
   - Total kittens = 7 + 36 + 12 = 55 kittens

3. **Final Answer:** {The final answer is 55 kittens}.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the total amount of the delivery fee:**

* The delivery fee is $3.00.

**2. Calculate the amount added to the price of the groceries:**

* A 25% fee on the original bill is calculated as 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00.

**3. Calculate the total cost after delivery fees:**

* The original bill was $40.00.
* They added a $10.00 fee for the 25% fee
* The total costs after delivery fees are $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00


**4. Calculate the final total cost including the tip:**

* The total cost after delivery fees is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

**5. Calculate the final total cost with the tip added:**
* The tip cost is $4.00
* The final total cost is $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00



** The final answer is $54.00**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of unripe oranges:**

* 20% of 25 oranges = (20/100) * 25 = 5 unripe oranges.

**2. Calculate the number of sour oranges:**

* 2 sour oranges are present.

**3. Calculate the number of oranges that are bad or unripe OR sour**

* This is simply the sum of the number of unripe, sour, and bad oranges.
* 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) + 1 (bad) = 8 oranges

**4. Calculate the number of good oranges**

*  Subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.
* 25 (total) - 8 (bad, unripe, sour) = 17 good oranges. 



{The final answer is 17} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges
The total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges
The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Step 1:  Calculate the total pension earned over 40 years.**

* Marcy's annual pension is $50,000 for 40 years.
* Total pension earned: $50,000 * 40 = $2,000,000

**Step 2:  Calculate the pension increase starting at year 21.**

* Marcy's pension increases by 5% of the original value.
*  This amount will be calculated yearly after year 20.

**Step 3:  Determine the amount of the pension increase.**

* The increase is 5% of the original pension, compounded annually.

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year.**
    * Aleena pays $140 per month, so the cost for six months would be $140 * 6 = $840. 
2. **Calculate the discount.**
    * The discount is 10% of the monthly cost, which means ($140 * 0.10) = $14.
3. **Calculate the reduced cost for the second half of the year.**
    * The cost for six months would be $140 * 5 = $700.
4. **Calculate the total cost for the year.**
    * The total cost is the initial cost and the cost reduced.
    * The cost for the first half year is $840, and the reduced cost for the second half is $700, so the cost for the entire year is $840 + $700 = $1540.



**The final answer is $1540**<end_of_turn><eos>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.

How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we can solve the problem:**

1. **Identify the knowns:**
   -  Distance driven so far: 100 miles
   -  Gallons of gas used: 4 gallons
   -  Tank capacity: 12 gallons

2. **Find the relationship:**
   -  We know the car uses a specific amount of gas for each distance traveled.
   -  To find this relationship, we need to determine the gas consumption rate per mile. 

3. **Calculate the gas consumption rate:**
   -  Divide the total gallons of gas used by the total miles driven. 
   -  Gas consumption rate = 4 gallons / 100 miles 
   -  This equals 0.04 gallons/mile.

4. **Determine total mileage:** 
   -  Multiply the gas consumption rate by the tank capacity. 
   -  Total miles = (0.04 gallons/mile) * (12 gallons)

Here's how we can break down this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate reading time per session**

* Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he spends 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour reading per session.

**Step 2: Calculate total TV and reading time per session**

* Total time = TV time + Reading time
* Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours per session.

**Step 3: Calculate total time for 3 sessions per week**

* Total time per week = 3 hours/session * 3 sessions/week = 9 hours per week 

**Step 4: Calculate total time for 4 weeks**

* Total time for 4 weeks = 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours

Here is the solution:

* **Step 1: Calculate the earnings from brownies.**
    *  Price per brownie: $3
    *  Number of brownies sold: 43
    *  Earnings from brownies: $3 * 43 = $129

* **Step 2: Calculate the earnings from cheesecakes.**
    * Price per cheesecake: $4
    * Number of cheesecakes sold: 23
    * Earnings from cheesecakes: $4 * 23 = $92

* **Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.** 
    * Total earnings: $129 + $92 = $221

 {The final answer is $221} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.
Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221

Here's the breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones**

* Cost per phone: $150
* Number of phones: 5
* Total cost: $150 * 5 = $750

**Step 2: Calculate the interest charge for each phone unit**

* Interest rate: 2%
* Total cost per phone: $150
* Interest charge per phone: $150 * 0.02 = $3

**Step 3: Calculate the total monthly interest charge**

* Total cost: $750
* Interest charge per unit: $3
* Total monthly interest: $3 * 5 = $15

**The Final answer is:** {Shiela will pay $15 each month for 3 months} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.

If he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square . footage of a level?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Pattern**

* Luke's sandcastle levels have a particular pattern: each level is half the size of the level below it.
* This means the square footage of the next level will be determined by the square footage of the current level divided by 2.

**Step 2: Calculate the Square Footage of Each Level**

* **Level 1:** 16 sq ft  
* **Level 2:** 16 sq ft / 2 = 8 sq ft
* **Level 3:** 8 sq ft / 2 = 4 sq ft
* **Level 4:** 4 sq ft / 2 = 2 sq ft

**Step 3: Find the Average Square Footage**

* To find the average square footage of a level, add up the square footage of each level and divide the sum by the number of levels. 
* Average Square Footage = (16 + 8 + 4 + 2) / 4 
* Average Square Footage = 30/4
* Average Square Footage = 7.5 sq ft

 {The final answer is 7.5 sq ft}

The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

Then she has to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the total cups of food needed in the first 180 days:**  
   * Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   * Total cups needed in the first 180 days: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups.
2. **Calculate the number of days in the rest of the puppy's life:**
   * The puppy's life lasts beyond the first 180 days.
   * Assume the puppy's life is indefinite. 
3. **Calculate the number of cups needed in the rest of the puppy's life:**
   * Cecilia needs 2 cups of dog food per day that continue for the rest of the puppy's life.
   * The number of days needed for the rest of the puppy's life is indefinite.
4.**Calculate the total number of cups needed:**
   * The total cups needed are the sum of cups for the first 180 days and cups for the rest of the puppy's life.
   * Total cups needed: 180 cups + 365 cups (for life) 


**Final answer:** {Cecilia will use 445 bags of dog food in the first year.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups
The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups

**Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:**

1. **David's laundry:** 
   - Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 
   - Sarah's laundry = 4 * David's laundry
   -  400 pounds = 4 * David's laundry 
   - David's laundry = 400 pounds / 4
   - David's laundry = 100 pounds

2. **Raymond's laundry:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
   - Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2
   - Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

3. **The difference:**
   - The difference in laundry between Raymond and David. = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
   - The difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds
   - The difference = 100 pounds

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1.  Find the number of packages of 3:**

* We want to buy 18 flowers. 
*  We can buy 18 flowers / 3 flowers/package = 6 packages of 3.

**2. Find the cost of flowers with 6 packages of 3:**

*Cost of 6 packages of 3 = 6 * $2.50 = $15.00

**3. Find the cost of flowers with 2 packages of 2:**

* Cost of 2 packages of 2 = 2 * $1.00  = $2.00

**4. Calculate the savings:**

* Savings = Cost of 6 packages of 3 - Cost of 2 packages of 2

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total water the two girls drank**
 * Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters. 
 *  (1/6) * 24 = 4 liters

**Step 2: Calculate the total water they drank together**
*  They drank a total of 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters

**Step 3: Calculate the total water after the girls drank**
*  The total water was 24 liters, and the girls drank 8 liters, so there are 24 - 8 = 16 liters left.

                    A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost. How many ! did they win?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Understand the problem:** The problem tells us the team won a certain number of games more than they lost. We need to figure out how many wins they had.

**2.  Set up variables:**
   - Let ""w"" represent the number of wins. 
   - Let ""l"" represent the number of losses.

**3. Formulate equations:**
   -  The team won 8 more than they lost. This can be written as an equation:  w = l + 8 

   - We know the total number of games are 22: w + l = 22 

**4. Solve the equations:**
   - **Use substitution:** We can solve for ""l"" in the first equation:  l = w - 8
   - **Substitute** this value of ""l"" into the second equation: (w) + (w -8) = 22

**5. Simplify and solve for ""w"":**
   - Combine like terms: 2w - 8 = 22 
   - Add 8 to both sides: 2w = 30
   - Divide both sides by 2: w = 15

 
**6. State the answer:**  {The final answer is 15}



Let me know if you'd like to work through any other problem together!  <end_of_turn><eos>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

The company has a policy of increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years. If Sylvie just clocked 5 years in the company last December, what's her annual salary after three more years : of service?<end_of_turn>
    

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Calculate Sylvie's initial salary.**

* The initial salary is $600 per month.

**Step 2: Calculate Sylvie's salary increase after five years.**

* 10% of the initial salary is $600 * 0.10 = $60.00 per month.

**Step 3: Calculate Sylvie's salary after five years.**

* Her salary after five years is $600 + $60 = $660 per month

**Step 4: Calculate her salary after another three years (total of eight years).**

 * Her salary after eight years is $660 * 1.10  = $726.00 per month

 {The final answer is $726.00}   
<end_of_turn><eos>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

                    Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. ? If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many copies did Harald sell?<end_of_turn>


Here's how I'd solve it step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let `x` represent the number of copies Harald sold.
*  Marilyn's copies = 10x 

**2. Set up the equation:**

*  Total copies sold = Harald's copies + Marilyn's copies
*  88,000 = x + 10x

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 88,000 = 11x
* Divide both sides by 11:  80,000 = x

**4. Answer the Question:** 
*  Harald sold **80,000** copies.  
{The final answer is 80,000} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000

Here's how we break down the problem:

**1.  Calculate the number of guests who don't show up:**

* Christina invited 16 friends.
* 1/4 of attendees don't show up.
* Number of guests who don't show up: 16 friends * (1/4) = 4 friends

**2. Calculate the number of guests who will attend:**

*  Number of guests who will attend: 16 friends - 4 friends = 12 guests

**3. Calculate the total number of gift bags needed:**

* Each guest needs 0.75 gift bags.
* Total gift bags needed: 12 guests * 0.75 gift bags/guest = 9 gift bags

**4. Calculate the total cost of the gift bags:**

* Each gift bag costs $2.
* Total cost: 9 gift bags * $2/gift bag = $18

If there ? will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need ? to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Find the amount of potato salad a child will eat:**  An adult eats 10 lbs, and a child eats half as much, so a child eats 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs

2. **Calculate the total potato salad needed for the adults:** 20 adults * 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

3.  **Calculate the total potato salad needed for the children:** 5 children * 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

4.  **Add the amount needed for adults and children together:** 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs


**The final answer is 225 lbs.**

*  Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: A = C - 2

**3. Set up the Equation Relating James' age to Corey's Age:**

*  James is 1 year younger than Corey:  J = C - 1

**4. Solve for the Constant, 'C':**

*  We know James is 10 years old. 
*  Substitute J = C - 1 into the equation: 10 = (C - 1)
*  Therefore: C = 11


**5. Solve for the Age of Amy:**

*  Substitute the value of 'C' into the equation for Amy: A = 11 - 2

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understand the Problem:**

* Freda cooks canned tomatoes to make sauce.
* The sauce volume reduces by half when cooked.
* Each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes.
* We need to find out how many tomatoes Freda used to make 32 ounces of sauce.

**2. Set up a Relationship:**

* We know the sauce volume reduces by half, so each 16-ounce can loses 8 ounces. 
* We need to determine the original number of tomatoes based on the sauce volume.


**3. Apply the Logic:**

 Since the sauce volume reduces by half, we need to determine the original number of tomatoes based on the sauce volume (32 ounces).



**4. Find the Number of Tomatoes Used** 

*  We know that 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes. 
    
**5. Final Answer:**

Therefore, Freda used {3 tomatoes} {The final answer is}

Here's the breakdown of our solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Setup**

* We have a traffic jam on the motorway.
* Cars are entering and exiting the traffic jam. 
* We know the number of cars initially on the road (30).

**Step 2: Consider the Details**

* The first 15 minutes:  Initially there were 30 cars.
* There are 5 cars who exit the road early.
* The next 15 minutes: 20 more cars enter
 


**Step 3: Determine the Equation**

* We need to figure out the number of cars that travel through the jam during the first 15 minutes. 

To do this, we can set up an equation.

**Step 4: Solve the Equation**

* Initially there were 30 cars.
*  5 cars exit
*  We need to know how many cars travel during the first 15 minutes.



**Step 5: Apply the Solution**


* The solution is:


{The final answer is 30}<end_of_turn><eos>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the second friend's rings:**

* The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more than the first friend.
* 1/4 of 20 times = (1/4) * 20 = 5 more rings.
* The second friend pressed 20 + 5 = 25 times.

**2. Calculate the third friend's rings:**

* The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
* 10 times of 60 = 600 rings.

**3. Calculate the total rings pressed by the first three friends:**

* The third friend pressed the doorbell 600 times.

**4. Calculate the total number of rings pressed**

* The doorbell made 20 + 25 + 600 = 645 rings {The final answer is} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.

John does this every weekday, but on the weekends he likes to relax and have a soda with dinner instead. ,  , How many glasses of water does John drink in a week?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify John's water consumption on weekdays:** 
   - John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday, totaling 3 glasses.

2. **Identify his water consumption on weekends:**
   - John has a soda with dinner on weekends, not water, instead of water.

3. **Calculate the total number of water glasses per week:** 
   - We will need to add the number of water glasses he drinks on weekdays and on weekends.
   -  Total cups of water per week = 3 cups/day * 7 days/week = 21 cups


**The final answer is 21 glasses of water.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","John has 4 glasses of water a day on each of the 5 weekdays, for 4*5= <<4*5=20>>20 glasses.

If the city is 42 miles . across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take , for the fog bank to cover the whole city?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we can break it down:**

1. **Determine the fog bank's coverage rate:**
   - The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes. We can represent this as a ratio: 3 miles / 10 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total time for the entire city:**
   - We know the city is 42 miles long. So, we need to multiply the coverage rate by the city's length. 

3. **Final calculation:**
   - To find the total time, we multiply the city's length by the coverage rate. The result gives the total duration.

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

1. **Calculate the initial number of pieces:** Poppy begins with 1000 pieces and puts a quarter of them on the board, so she has 1000 / 4 = 250 pieces left. 

2. **Calculate the number of pieces her mom added:** Her mom then adds a third of the remaining pieces, so she adds 250 * (1/3) = 83.33 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces placed:**  To find the total number of pieces Poppy and her mom placed, add the initial number and the pieces her mom adds. This gives us 250 + 83.33 = 333.33 pieces 
 
4. **Calculate the number of pieces left**

5. **Final answer:** {The final answer is: 666.67}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

Here's how I'd break down the problem to find the solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Dimensions**

*   We have three boxes.
*   Each box is 5 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 4 inches high.

**Step 2: Calculate the Volume of One Box**

*   Volume of a box = length × width × height 
*   Volume of one box = 5 inches × 6 inches × 4 inches = 120 cubic inches

**Step 3:  Account for the Wall Thickness**

*   The walls are 1 inch thick, so we must subtract the thickness of the walls from each dimension.


**Step 4: Calculate the Inner Volume**

*   The volume of an enclosed space is determined by subtracting the wall thickness.
*   After subtracting the wall thickness, find the actual inner volume.

**Final Answer is** 120 cubic inches - 1 inch (3 sides)  = 119 cubic inches. 



Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any particular step! <end_of_turn><eos>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let `e` represent the number of 1-hour episodes watched on Monday & Tuesday.
*  Let `f` represent the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday.

**2.  Set Up Equations:**

*  **Monday & Tuesday:** 2 * e = 7 hours (Since he watched each episode of his favorite show for 1 hour)
*  **Wednesday:** f + (1/2) * 30 = 7 (since the total time across this day is 7 hours.)
* **Thursday:** 2 *(1) + (1/2)* 30 = 7

**3. Solve for the unknowns.**

* We already have three equations that are sufficient to solve for the unknown variables.


**4.Final Answer:**

{The final answer is}
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

How many cookies did Henry bake last year?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem step by step:

**1. Set up an unknown variable:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year. 

**2. Translate the given information into an equation:**

* ""He wants to make twice as many as he did last year""  translates to:  2x = total cookies baked this year
* ""He realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to"" translates to:  x + 15 = total cookies baked this year.

**3. Combine and solve the information:**

* We know his total cookies are 110, and there is a mistake in the baking. 
*  Since he baked 15 more cookies, we can rewrite the equation to:  x + 15 = 110


**4. Solve for x:**

* Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to find the number of cookies he baked this year.
*  x + 15 - 15 = 110 - 15 
*  x = 95


**5. Final Answer:**

The final answer is: **95 cookies** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost without cashback.**

* The gas costs $3.00 per gallon.
* They are buying 10 gallons.
* Cost without cashback: 10 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $30.00

**Step 2: Calculate the cashback amount.**

* They get $.20 cashback per gallon.
* They bought 10 gallons.
* Cashback: 10 gallons * $0.20/gallon = $2.00

**Step 3: Calculate the final cost.**

* Cost before cashback: $30.00
* Cashback received: $2.00
* Final cost: $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

**The final answer is $28.00** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

*Step 1:* Define the variables we'll use in the problem. 
*Step 2:* Set up an equation.
*Step 3:* Solve for the answer in the equation to find how much they ate. 
*Step 4:* Find the average.



Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

It took her sixteen seconds , to row twenty : feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken on by the time Julia reached shore?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Find Julia's rowing speed.**

* Julia rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds.
* Divide the distance by the time to find the speed: 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

**Step 2:  Calculate the total distance Julia rowed.**

* She needed to row back to the shore, so we use her speed to figure this out.

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in a certain time** 

*  Calculate the distance traveled for every seconds. This is done by multiplying the rate of speed by the time.

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of water the boat took on**

* To do this, We multiply the distance travelled by the amount of water taken in per 10 feet of back.



**Let me know if you'd like help with any specific step!** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**

* Jamal's phone holds 6 times more photos than Brittany's.
* Let's represent the number of photos Brittany's phone can hold with the variable 'B'.
* Therefore, we know  B = 6 * Jamal's phone capacity 
* B = 6 * 1800 = 10800 photos

**2. Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**

* Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the birds in Jamal's photo
 
**3. Find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**

* We know Brittany's phone holds 10800 photos.
* We need to find the number of birds in Jamal's photo. 
* Since we have the amount of photos Brittany's can hold for 
* We can find the number of birds in Jamal's photo by dividing the total photos on Brittany's phone by 50 

**4. Solve for the number of birds in Jamal's photo:**


*Number of birds = 10800 photos / 50 = 216 

 


**{The final answer is 216}**

                    question:
                    Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio : of 7:13. If . she used a total of 120 teaspoons of . sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of ! teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Ratio**

* The ratio 7:13 means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water. 

**Step 2: Translate the Ratio to a Proportion**

* We are given a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar. This information will help us solve for the number of cups of water she used.

**Step 3:  Set up an Equation**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cups of water used.
* We can express the ratio as a proportion:   (7/13) = 120 / x 

**Step 4: Solve for x**

* Cross-multiply to isolate x:
  * 7x = 13 * 120
* Simplify:
  * 7x = 1560
* Divide both sides by 7: 
  * x = 222.86 (rounded) 
   


**Step 5:  Find the Number of Teaspoons of Sugar** 

* Remember, the ratio is 7:13, meaning she uses 7 parts of sugar for every 13 parts of water. 

**Step 6:  Calculate the Number of Teaspoons of Sugar**


*  You can use your knowledge of the ratio to find the number of teaspoons of sugar
   




{The final answer is 84 teaspoons} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20
Since the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42

If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two ! were receiving four years later?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'L' represent Lylah's salary four years ago.
*  Let 'A' represent Adrien's salary four years ago.

**2. Relationships between Salaries:**

*  Adrien's total salary four years ago: A
*  Adrien's salary four years later: A + 40% of (A) 
*  Lylah's salary four years ago: L
*  Lylah's salary four years later: L + 40% of (L)

**3. Set Up Expressions Based on the Given Information:**

*  Adrien's total salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, so: A = 1.30L 
*  Adrien's salary four years later: A + 40% of (A) = A + 0.40A = 1.40A
*  Lylah's salary four years later: L + 40% of (L) = L + 0.40L = 1.40L

**4.  Solve for the Unknown Variables:**

* We know A = 40000 
* Substitute A in the expressions above to solve for L. 
 * 40000 = 1.30L
 * L = 40000 /1.30 = 30769
* Substitute L and A into the final salary equation. 
* Total salary four years later: 1.40 (40000)

**5.  Calculate Total Salary for Adrien and Lylah:**




**6. Find the final answer** 
{The final answer is $56000}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Calculate sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday**
   * Sadie slept 2 hours less each night than Monday.
   * So, on Tuesday she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
   * And on Wednesday she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.

* **Step 2: Calculate her sleep for the rest of the week**
   * The rest of the week Sadie slept 1 hour more than Tuesday and Wednesday combined.
   * Total sleep on Tuesday & Wednesday: 6 + 4 = 10 hours.
   * Further she slept 1 hour more: 10 + 1 = 11 hours.
 
* **Step 3: Calculate total sleep for the week**

Here's the solution step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance run in the first 3 hours.**

* Velocity = Distance / Time 
* Distance = Velocity * Time
* Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours
* Distance = 30 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance run in 7 hours at the slower speed.**

* Time = 7 hours 
* Velocity = 5 miles/hour
* Distance = Velocity * Time
* Distance = 5 miles/hour * 7 hours
* Distance = 35 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance run.**

* Total Distance = Distance (first 3 hours) + Distance (7 hours at 5 miles/hour)
* Total Distance = 30 miles + 35 miles
* Total Distance = 65 miles


{The final answer is 65 miles}

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We need to find the initial number of letters in the ""needs stamps"" pile.
* We know Jennie stamps one-third of the 'needs stamps' letters, and now there are 30 already stamped. 


**2.  Work Backwards:**

* We know 1/3 of the 'needs stamps' letters were stamped, meaning 2/3 were not yet stamped.
* We are seeking the initial number of unstamped 'needs stamps' letters, so we can work from there to find the initial number.

**3.  Set Up a Proportion:**

* The key is to find a relationship between the stamps on the 'needs stamps' letters and the number of un-stamped letters. 


**4. Create an equation and solve for unknowns:**
   * Since 2/3 of the 'needs stamps ' letters were *not* stamped.

Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.  How many spoons were in the package that Julia bought?<end_of_turn>


**Step 1:** Define variables.

* Let  ""x"" represent the number of spoons in the original package that Julia bought.
 
**Step 2:** Write an equation. 

* Julia started with x spoons and then received 5 additional spoons from her husband, so this becomes: x + 5 
* She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, leaving her with 12 spoons. This can be represented as: (x + 5) – 3 = 12. {This is the equation we're working with}

**Step 3:** Solve for x.

To get x by itself we can follow these steps:

1. Add 3 to both sides of equation
   (x + 5) – 3 + 3 = 12 + 3
2. Simplify
   x + 5 = 15 
3. Subtract 5 from both sides
  x + 5 – 5 = 15 – 5

Here's how I'd think step-by-step to solve this problem

**1. Determine the cost of a watermelon.**
   * We know watermelons cost three times as much as peppers.
   *  Cost of a pepper = $15.
   * Cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.

**2. Determine the cost of an orange.**
   *  An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon.
   *  Cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40.

**3. Calculate the total cost of the watermelons.**
   * Cost of 4 watermelons = 4 * $45 = $180.
 
**4. Calculate the total cost of the peppers.**
   *  Cost of 20 peppers = 20 * $15 = $300 .
   
**5. Calculate the total cost of the oranges.**
   *  Cost of 10 oranges = 10 * $40 = $400.

* Patient's hourly cost: $200/hour
* Total patient cost for the day: $200/hour * 200 hours = $40,000

 **Step 5: Calculate the hospital's profit**

* Profit = Total revenue - Total costs
* = Total hospital revenue - Total doctor costs - Total patient costs 
* = $0 - $30,000 - $40,000 = -$70,000


**The final answer is -$70,000.**
 

**Explanation:** 
 We followed a step-by-step approach by considering each aspect:  
* The frequency and time spent by patients, 
* The cost of doctors' services based on an hourly rate,
* The cost of the patients based on an hourly rate,
* And finally, calculating the total revenue generated by the hospital. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit.**

*  (1/3) * 60 elves = 20 elves

**Step 2:  Calculate the number of elves remaining after the vomit incident.**

* 60 elves - 20 elves = 40 elves

**Step 3:  Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins.**

* 10 elves

**Step 4:  Calculate the final number of elves.**

* 40 elves - 10 elves = 30 elves

 


{The final answer is 30 elves.}<end_of_turn><eos>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.

Here's how we can solve the problem:

**Step 1: Find the expenditure in June.**

* We know Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.
* His expenditure in June was $60 less than May, so we subtract $60 from May's expenditure. 
*  June's expenditure = $500 - $60 = $440

**Step 2: Calculate the total expenditure.**

*  To find the total expenditure for both months, we add his expenditure in May and June.
* Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940

{The final answer is $940.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","His expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $<<500-60=440>>440.

*

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the tickets used for the roller coaster:**

* Pam spent 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
* Fred spent 4 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets

**2. Calculate the tickets used for the luge:**

* Pam spent 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets
* Fred spent 2 rides * 6 tickets/ride = 12 tickets

**3. Calculate the total tickets used:**

* Total tickets = tickets for roller coaster + tickets for luge
* Total tickets = 12 tickets + 12 tickets + 24 tickets + 12 tickets = 60 tickets

**The final answer is:** 60 tickets. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.
The total times they ride that day is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 times.
So, Pam and Fred used 10x6=<<10*6=60>>60 tickets that day.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**Step 1: Find the distance walked on Tuesday.**

* Walt walked 6 times as far on Tuesday as Monday. 
* Distance on Tuesday = 4 miles * 6 = 24 miles.

**Step 2: Find the total distance walked on Monday and Tuesday.**

*  Total distance on Monday and Tuesday = 4 miles + 24 miles = 28 miles.

**Step 3: Find the distance walked on Wednesday**

*  Total distance Monday through Wednesday = 28 miles + Total mileage on Wednesday.
* We know the total mileage Monday through Wednesday is 41 miles. 
*  Therefore, Total distance on Wednesday = 41 miles - 28 miles = 13 miles. 



**The final answer is 13 miles.**<end_of_turn><eos>","Walt’s Tuesday walk was 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles.
Walt’s Monday and Tuesday walk were 4+24 = <<4+24=28>>28 miles combined.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Find out how many video games Bobby had before Brian lost some:**
   - Brian had 20 games.
   - ""Before the comparison was made"" suggests we need to account for his loss.
   - Therefore, he had 20-5 = 15 games before the comparison.

2. **Determine how many video games Bobby has:**
    - Bobby has 3 times as many as Brian, so he had 3 * 15 = 45 games.

3. **Final Answer is:**  Bobby has 45 video games. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

<end_of_turn><eos>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

                    John has 10 hectares . of a pineapple field. There are 100 pineapples per hectare. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. How many pineapples can John harvest within a year?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the total number of pineapples:**
* John has 10 hectares.
* There are 100 pineapples per hectare.
* Total pineapples = 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

**2. Determine the harvest period frequency:**
* John harvests every 3 months.

**3.  Calculate the number of harvests per year:**
* In a year, there are 12 months. 
*  Harvests per year = 12 months / 3 months per harvest = 4 harvests

**4. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
* He harvests 1000 pineapples per hectare per harvest. 
*  Total pineapples harvested yearly = 4 harvests * 1000 pineapples/harvest = 4000 pineapples

{The final answer is 4000 pineapples} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.
John can harvest his Pineapple 12 ÷ 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 times per year
Therefore John can harvest 1000 x 4 = <<1000*4=4000>>4000 pineapples per year.

How many blocks does ; Johnny pick up if he picks up . all the legos?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Determine the number of pieces in the second box**
*  The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, which has 500 pieces.
*  3 times the original number = 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces

**Step 2: Determine the number of pieces in the third box**
* The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the second box.
* 1/4 of 1500 = (1/4) * 1500 = 375 pieces

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces Johnny picks up**
*  Add the number of pieces from all three boxes.
*  500 + 1500 + 375 = 2375 pieces

**Step 4:  The final answer is ... 2375 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks

**Here's how we can break down the problem:**

1. **Initial bee departures:** Debra observes 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 

2. **Return bees:** After the first 6 hours, 30 bees / 2 = 15 bees return. 

3. **Overall bee departures:** 
    * 30 bees - 15 bees = 15 bees left
    
4. **Total bee departures from the first 12 hours:** Debra observes 30 bees - 15 bees = 15 bees departing.
 


**The final answer is 15 bee .**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate Steve's biking time:**

*  Steve's biking distance: 3 miles 
*  Steve's biking speed: 440 feet/minute

**2. Calculate Tim's skateboarding time:**

*  Tim's skateboarding distance: 2 miles
*  Tim's skateboarding speed: 264 feet/minute

**3. Determine the conversion of miles to feet:**

*  1 mile = 5280 feet

**4. Convert Steve's biking distance and speed to feet:**

*  3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet

* Steve's pace in feet per minute:  440 feet/minute

**5. Determine Steve's biking time in minutes:**

*  Time = Distance / Speed
*  Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute 
*  Time = 36.0 minutes


**6. Determine Tim's skateboarding time in minutes:**

*  Time = Distance / Speed
*  Time = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 264 feet/minute
*  Time = 40 minutes

**7. Determine the difference in finishing time**

*  Time difference = Tim's skateboarding time - Steve's biking time
* Time difference = 40 minutes - 36.0 minutes
* Time difference = 4.0 minutes
 


**The final answer is:** Tim will be waiting 4 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies**

* Carl has 10 packs of cookies.
* Each pack contains 6 cookies.
* Total cookies = 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the cookies**

* Each cookie costs $0.10.
* Total cost = 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

**Step 3: Determine the change**

* Carl pays with a $10 bill.
* Change = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

{The final answer is $4.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.

* 


**Solution**
1. **Start with Dave's initial fries:** We know the problem states Dave bought a large pack of fries. The only thing we know about the initial amount is that it wasn't zero. 
2. **Seagull's meal:** The seagull ate half of what Dave ate. We know the seagull ate half the amount Dave ate.
3. **Pigeons and their food:** The pigeons ate three fries each, so they ate a total of 3 fries/pigeon * 3 pigeons = 9 fries.
4. **Remaining fries:** We know Dave began with a large amount and the seagull took half. 
5. **Raccoon's attack:** We know the raccoon took two-thirds of what's left. 
6. **Final touch:** The ants take one, leaving five. {The final answer is 15}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Find Blake's total distance:**

* Blake runs back and forth 15 times in 15 minutes. 
* One run is the length of the football field, which is 100 yards.
* Therefore, Blake runs a total of 100 yards * 15 = 1500 yards

**2. Find Kelly's total distance:**

* Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
* Her runs to the 40-yard line add up to 40 yards * 34 runs = 1360 yards

**3. Find the difference in distance:**

* The difference between Blake's distance and Kelly’s distance: 1500 yards - 1360 yards = 140 yards

**4. The final answer is:**


{140 yards}  



<end_of_turn><eos>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

**Solution**

1. **Find the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - The tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than Monday.
   - The depth on Tuesday was 17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet.

2. **Find the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find out how many starfish Locsin caught:**

* Anakin caught 10 starfish.
* Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

**2.  Find out how many seahorses Locsin caught:**

* Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
* Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

**3. Find out how many clownfish Locsin caught:**

* Anakin caught 3 clownfish. 
* Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

**4. Calculate the total number of fish Anakin caught:**

* Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish.

**5.  Calculate the total number of fish Locsin caught:**

* Locsin caught 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish. 

**6. Find the total number of fish they caught together:**

*  Anakin's fish + Locsin's fish = 19 + 13 = 32 fish.



{The final answer is 32} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Determine the price increase after each two-month period:**

* The price increases by 20% of the original price, so the increase amount is 0.20 * $20 = $4.

**2. Calculate the price after each two-month period:**

*  After the first two-month period, the price is $20 + $4 = $24.

**3. Repeat the above calculation for 36 two-month periods:**

* The price after 36 two-month periods is $24 * ( 1.20) ^ 36 

**4. Calculate the final cost using the appropriate expression:**

* The general progression of the equation is: P(n) = P₀(1.20)^n 
    * where P(n) is the price after n two-month periods 
    * P₀ is the initial price 


**5. Final answer:**
{The final answer is $24 * (1.20)^36}

**Here's how we can solve the problem:**

1. **Figure out the value of one action figure:** The question states that one action figure costs $5.

2. **Determine the value of a red car:** We know that one red car costs $4.

3. **Calculate the value of the toys based on the given information:**
   * Doll value: 3 action figures value = $15
   * Red car value: 5 red cars value = $20

4. **Calculate the total cost of all toys:** 
   * Doll Value + Red Car Value + Action Fig Value = Total cost
   * $15 + $20 + $25 = $60

{The final answer is $60} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.
The red cars are worth 5 * 4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let  'S' represent Seth's current age.
* Let 'B' represent Brooke's current age.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations from the given Information**

*  ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke.""   This translates to:  S = 2B 
*  ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28."" This translates to: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28

**Step 3: Simplify the Second Equation**

* Combine the constant terms in the second equation: S + B + 4 = 28

**Step 4: Substitute the First Equation into the Simplified Second Equation**

*  We know S = 2B. Substitute this value of S into the simplified second equation:  2B + B + 4 = 28
 
**Step 5: Solve for B**
* Combine the B terms: 3B + 4 = 28
* Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24
* Divide both sides by 3: B = 8

**Step 6: Solve for S**

* Substitute the value of B (8) into the equation S = 2B:  S = 2 * 8
* Therefore: S = 16

 


**Step 7: State the Final Answer**

 {The final answer is Seth is 16 years old.}<end_of_turn><eos>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years ; old, what's the total age of the four . birds?<end_of_turn>

Here's how we can break down this problem:

**1. Identify the given information:**

* Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
* Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

**2. Set up relationships based on the given information:**

* Sally Four's age = Sally Thirtytwo's age = 8 years.

**3. Determine Granny Red's age:**

* Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
* Sally Four's age = 8 years.
* Granny Red's age = 2 * 8 years = 16 years.

**4. Determine Sally Two's age:**

* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
* Granny Red's age = 16 years.
* Sally Two's age = 16 + 3 = 19 years.


**5. Determine Sally Two's age:**

* Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
* Granny Red's age = 16 years.
* Sally Two's age = 16 + 3 = 19 years.


**6. Determine Sally One's age:**


* Sally One's age is the same as Sally Two's age.
* Sally Two's age = 19 years.



**7. Find the total age of the four birds:**


* Sally One's age = 19 years
* Granny Red's age = 16 years
* Sally Two's age = 19 years
* Sally Four's age = 8 years.
 
 Total age of the four birds = 19 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 62 years
 **{The final answer is 62}**



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.
Granny red is two times as old as Sally four, meaning Granny red is 2*8 = <<2*8=16>>16 years old.
Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

If Jessica wants . to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she pay in a , year?<end_of_turn>
* * *

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate total minimum payments per month:** 
   * Student loans: $300
   * Credit card: $200
   * Mortgage: $500
   * Total minimum monthly payments: $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

**2. Calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay:**
   * 50% of the minimum payment = (50/100) * $1000 = $500

**3. Calculate Jessica's total monthly payment:**
   * Total payment = Minimum payment + (50% of minimum payment)
   * Total payment = $1000 + $500 = $1500

**4. Calculate Jessica's total yearly payments:**
  * Total yearly payments = Total monthly payment * 12 months
   * Total yearly payments = $1500 * 12 = $18,000 {The final answer is}


 
Let me know if you have any more questions! <end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for peeling.**

* Billy spends 1.5 minutes peeling each potato.
* He has 60 potatoes.
* Time to peel all potatoes = 1.5 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 90 minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for cutting.**

* Billy takes 5 seconds to cut each potato.
* He has 60 potatoes.
* Time to cut all potatoes = 5 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds = 5 minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate the total preparation time.**

* Total time = Time to peel + Time to cut
* Total time = 90 minutes + 5 minutes = 95 minutes

**The final answer is:** 95 minutes. 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the profit per gallon:**
*  They made a profit of $25. 
*  Remember, profit is the revenue they receive minus the cost of ingredients and all the expenses.
* So, their total earnings per gallon, Revenue = $25.
   
**2. Calculate the total cost per gallon:**
*  Each gallon costs $3 for lemons + $2 for sugar = $5
  
**3 Find the revenue per gallon:**
* Since they get $20 glasses from each gallon and they sell each glass for $0.50.
* Total revenue per gallon=$20 x $0.50 = $10.

**4. Determine the total cost of ingredients per gallon:** 
* The total cost per gallon is $5 (from step 2).
*
**5. Calculate the number of gallons they made **
* The revenue their earnings per gallon is $10. But, each gallon costs $5 in ingredients
* The earnings per gallon ($10) must cover the ingredient cost as well. 

 


Let me know if you want a deeper explanation of any of the steps. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10
Each gallon costs $5 to make because 3 + 2 = <<5=5>>5
They make $5 off each gallon because 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5
They made and sold 5 gallons because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5
They spent $15 on lemons because 5 x 3 = <<5*3=15>>15

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Determine the number of Chinese people:**
   - Start with the total number of Asians: 240
   - Subtract the number of Japanese: 240 - 80 = 160
   - This indicates that 160 people are Chinese.

**2. Determine the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   - We know that 60 are boys on the Chinese team. 

**3.  We need to determine the number of girls**
   - For this, we need to apply the understanding that  the number of girls adds up to the total number of Chinese people.

*Show your work*

**Here's how we can find the solution:**

1. **Find Monic's crabs:**
   * Bo has 40 crabs.
   * Monic has 4 fewer than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

2. **Find Rani's crabs:**
   * Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

3. **Calculate the total number of crabs:** 
   *  Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs 
   * Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs.


**{The final answer is 122}**

   * Sandra ordered 5 times the number of white carnations as pink calla lilies.
   * Sandra needs the red roses by 5pm.


2. **Define variables:**

   *  Let 'p' represent the number of pink calla lilies. 


3. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  **Red Roses:** We know r = 4w (from  ""four times the number of red roses as white carnations"")
   *  **Pink Calla Lilies:**  We know p = 5w (from ""5 times the number of white carnations as pink calla lilies"") 
   *  **Red Roses and Calla Lilies:** We know that Sandra has ordered these in combination, so we need to focus the information about the red roses and the white carnations.


4. **Solve for red roses:**
   * To solve for the number of red roses (r), we can use the information regarding the number of white carnations.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Define variables**

*  Let 'M' represent Mark's age.
*  Let 'J' represent Jean's age.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

*  We are told: ""Jean is two years older than Mark."" 
    *  J = M + 2
*  We are told: ""Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age."" 
    *  This translates to:  M - 2 = (1/2)J - 5 

**Step 3: Substitute to solve for Age of Mark (M)**

* We know that J = M + 2  We can substitute this into the second equation:
    * M - 2 = (1/2)(M + 2) - 5
   
**Step 4: Solve for Mark (M)**

* Simplify the equation: 
    * M - 2 = (1/2)M + 1 - 5
    * M - 2 = (1/2)M - 4
* Solve for M by subtracting (1/2)M from both sides and then adding 4 to both sides:
    * (1/2)M + 2 = 4 
    * (1/2)M = 2
    * M = 4 * 2 
    * M = 8 

**Step 5: Solve for Jean (J)**

* Substitute the value of M into the equation: 
    * J = 8 + 2
    * J = 10


**Step 6: Answer the question**

*  We know that:
    * Mark is 8 years old.
    * Jean is 10 years old.
 {The final answer is} Jean is 10 years old.

Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?<end_of_turn>


Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Define variables:**
   *  Let 'x' be the time it takes for the slower team's first runner to complete a 400m leg.
   *  Let 'y' be the time it takes for the slower team's second runner to complete a 400m leg. 
   *  Let 'z' be the time it takes for the slower team's third runner to complete a 400m leg.
   *  Let 'w' be the time it takes for the slower team's fourth runner to complete a 400m leg.

**2.  Calculate the faster team's times:** 
   * The faster team's first runner will take 3 seconds less than the previous runner, so they will take 55 - 3 = 52 seconds. 

**3.  Create a timeline for the slower team:** 
	 *  The slower team has a consistent first runner, so we are concerned with their second, third, and fourth runners.

**4.  Calculate the total time for the slower team:** 
	 *  They will take 60 + y + z + w seconds. 


**5. Calculate the difference in time:** 
*  The faster team's total time will be: 55 + 52 + 52 + 52 = 211 seconds.
*   The slower team's total time will be: 60 + y + z + w seconds. 


**6.  Find the difference in seconds:** 
*  The faster team will win by 211 - (60 + y + z + w) seconds.
	

**7. Result:** {The final answer is 211 - (60 + y + z + w) seconds.}




<end_of_turn><eos>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

*  For the first even number, we use the probability we calculated in Step 1: **1/2**.
*  To get the second even number, we need an even number to be rolled again. This continues, ensuring the probability remains the same.

**Step 3: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3**

* To get the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we consider the numbers on the die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).

 


Let me know if you would like me to break down the probability calculations for individual numbers greater than 3. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents, how many rats are in each cage?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Find the total number of rats.**

* We know rats are kept in 3 equal-sized groups.
* Each group has 6 pieces of straw and there are 160 pieces distributed among the rats.
* To find the number of rats, we use this information. 

**Step 2: Find the number of rats per group.**

* Divide the total straw by the number of pieces per rat.
* {The number of rats per group is 26.6666}

**Step 3: Calculate the number of rats in each cage.**

* Rats are kept in 3 cages
* The total number of rats.


{The final answer is} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

**Solution:**

* **1. Calculate the monthly interest:**
    * Interest rate: 2%
    * Principal amount (money owed): $100
    * Monthly interest = (2/100) * $100 = $2
* **2. Calculate the interest for the 3-month period:**
    * Interest for 3 months = $2/month * 3 months = $6
* **3. Calculate the total amount Mandy needs to pay:**
    * Total amount = Principal amount + Interest for 3 months 
    * Total amount = $100 + $6 = $106


**The final answer is $106**<end_of_turn><eos>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

* Total cost of buying the wheat: $20 + $2 = $22 per bag

**2.  Calculate the total selling price of the wheat**

* Selling price per bag: $30
* Total bags sold: unknown

**3. Find the total revenue from selling the wheat:**

* Total revenue = Total selling price per bag * Total number of bags
* Total revenue = $30 * (Number of bags sold) 

**4.  Determine the profit made from selling the wheat:**

* Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
* $400 = ($30 * (Number of bags sold)) - ($22 * (Number of bags sold))

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:** 
   - Start with the total amount spent on tickets. 
   - $20.25

2. **Calculate the cost of food:**
   - Subtract the amount spent on food from the amount spent on tickets.
   - $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rides:**
   - Multiply the cost per ride by the number of rides.
   - $33 x 2 = $66

4. **Calculate the total cost of all expenses:**

Here's how we can solve that:

**1. Find the total weekly insect requirement per duck:**
   - We know each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.

**2. Calculate the total daily insect requirement per duck:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so divide the weekly requirement by 7.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1.  Start with the initial tree population:**

* Tom begins with 50 trees.

**2.  Calculate the tree count after planting:**

* He plants 10 trees a year, so after 10 years, he would have planted 10 * 10 = 100 trees.

Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A : pays him : 5 cents per sentence. ; How ? much does Mark make in a week, in cents?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}

Solution:
1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Mark edits 1000 sentences per week.
   - Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. 

2. **Set up the calculation:** 
   - We need to find out how much Publisher B pays Mark for each sentence.
   - We know Publisher B pay = 2 * Publisher A pay 
   - So, Publisher B pay = 2 * 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence

3. **Calculate Publisher A payment:**
   - Mark earns 5 cents/sentence from Publisher A.

4. **Calculate Publisher B payment:**
   - Mark earns 10 cents/sentence from Publisher B.

5. **Find Mark's total weekly earnings:**
   - Total earnings = (Publisher A earnings) + (Publisher B earnings)
   - Total earnings = (5 cents/sentence * 1000 sentences) + (10 cents/sentence * 1000 sentences)
   - Total earnings = 5000 cents + 10000 cents
   - Total earnings = 15000 cents

6.  **Convert to dollars:**
   - The total earnings in cents is 15000 cents.

7. **State the answer:** 
   - Mark makes $15.00 for editing 1000 sentences a week.




<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

**Step-by-step reasoning**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    *  Josie's farm has 10 acres.
    *  Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
    *  Each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.

2. **Determine how to find the total wine output:**
    * We need to calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced, then multiply that by the number of barrels each ton makes.


3. **Calculate the total grape production:**
    * Total grapes produced = Acres * Grapes per acre 
    * Total grapes produced = 10 acres * 5 tons/acre
    * Total grapes produced = 50 tons 

4. **Calculate the total barrels of wine:**
    * Total barrels produced = Total grapes * Barrels per ton
    * Total barrels produced = 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton
    * Total barrels produced = 100 barrels 

5. **State the answer:**
   {The final answer is 100 barrels of wine}.




 **Therefore, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.
If each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, then 50 tons makes 2*50=<<50*2=100>>100 barrels of wine per year.

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. ? How many slices of cheese did he use?<end_of_turn>

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate total cheese from sandwiches:**
   * Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, which is 7 days.
   * He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese.

**2. Calculate cheese used for omelets:**
   * He ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   * He used 1 slice more than a sandwich, so for each omelet, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   * Total slices for omelets: 3 * 3 = 9 slices.

**3. Calculate cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   * He used 8 slices of cheese in his mac and cheese dish.

**4. Calculate total cheese usage:**
   * Combine the cheese usage from sandwiches, omelets, and mac and cheese: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices

{The final answer is 31} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

Here's how we can approach this:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

*  We know the weight of each chocolate bar in grams.
*  We know the weight of each candied apple in grams. 

**2. Calculate the Weight of One Candied Apple:**

*  A chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple.
*  We know a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. 
*  Therefore, the candied apple weighs 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams.

**3. Calculate the Total Weight of the Chocolate Bars:**

*  Joe has 25 chocolate bars. 
*  The weight of each chocolate bar is 40 grams.
*  Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams.

**4. Calculate the Total Weight of the Candied Apples:**

*  Joe has 80 candied apples.
*  Each candied apple weighs 20 grams.
*  Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.

**5. Calculate the Total Weight of the Bag of Candy:**

* Total weight = weight of chocolate bars + weight of candied apples
* Total weight = 1000 grams + 1600 grams = 2600 grams.


**Answer: The final answer is 2600 grams.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.
The chocolate bars weigh 40*25=<<40*25=1000>>1000 grams in total.

                    Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of ? buying each cup.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:**

* Cost per plate: $6000
* Number of plates: 1/2 dozen = 6 
* Total cost:  $6000 * 6 = $36,000

**2. Find the cost of twenty dozen cups:**

* Cost of half a dozen plates = $36,000
* Twenty dozen cups cost $36,000 more than the cost of half a dozen plates.
* Cost of twenty dozen cups: $36,000 + $1200 = $37,200

**3. Calculate the cost of one cup:**

* Total cost of twenty dozen cups: $37,200
* Number of cups: 20 dozen = 240 cups
* Cost of one cup: $37,200 / 240 = $156

 


**The final answer is $156** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:**

* Jacket cost: $30
* Each pair of shoes cost: $20
* Total cost: $30 + ($20 * 2) = $30 + $40 = $70

**2. Calculate Sara's earnings from babysitting:**

* Earnings per babysitting visit: $5

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   *  Let 'r' represent the number of red chickens.
   *  Let 'w' represent the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations from Given Information:**
   *  We know that the total number of eggs per day is 42.  
      * 3r + 5w = 42   (The eggs from the red and white chickens)
   * We are told that there are two more white chickens than red chickens. 
      * w = r + 2  

3. **Solve for one Variable in terms of the other:**
   *  We can substitute the value of 'w' from the second equation into the first:
      * 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

4. **Simplify and solve for the remaining Variable:**
   *  3r + 5r + 10 = 42
   *  8r + 10 = 42
   *  8r = 32
   *  r = 4

5. **Find the Number of White Chickens:**
   * Using the equation w = r + 2:
     * w = 4 + 2 
     * w = 6

6. **Answer the Question:**
   *  Jerry has **4** red chickens.  



{The final answer is 4}<end_of_turn><eos>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

{The final answer is}


Solution:
1. **Find the number of customers on the second day:** 
   - Sloane counted 50 more customers on the second day than the first day.
   - 100 customers + 50 customers = 150 customers.

2. **Find the total customers counted on the second and third day:**
   - Sloane counted 150 customers on the second day and 500 customers total.

3. **Find the number of customers counted on the first day:**
   - The total customers counted on the first and second day was 500.

{The final answer is}

*

Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

**1. Set up variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the amount of water in the small pool initially. 

**2.  Formulate equations based on the information given:**

* **4 minutes ago:** The big pool had twice the water of the small pool. 
    * This translates to an equation:  2x = Big pool water 4 minutes ago
* **Now:** The big pool has four times the water of the small pool.
    *  This translates to an equation:  4x = Big pool water now

**3. Express the difference in water amounts:**

* The problem asks how much water is in the small pool now.
* We need to express this in terms of the initial water amount in the small pool.
 

Let me know if you need further clarification! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
    -  Find 10% of the principal amount: 0.10 * $2000 = $200
    - Therefore, the total interest will be $200.

2. **Calculate the total repayment amount:**
    - Add the principal amount plus the interest to find the total amount Janeth will repay: $2000 + $200 = $2200

3. **Calculate the monthly repayments:**
    - The total repayment amount will be $2200, and Janeth will pay $165 per month for 12 months: $2200 x 12= $26400

4. **Calculate remaining balance:**
    - Subtract the monthly repayments from the total repayment amount: $26400 - $26400 = $0


**The final answer is $0**  



<end_of_turn><eos>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

### Step-by-step Solution:

* **Step 1: Define variables.**
   * Let  'A' represent Adrian's current age.
   * Let 'H' represent Harriet's current age.
   * Let 'Z' represent Zack's current age.

* **Step 2: Set up the equations based on the information given.**
    *  ""Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet"": A = 3H
    *  ""Harriet is half the age of Zack"": H = (1/2)Z

* **Step 3: Solve for the age of Adrian in terms of Harriet's age.**
    * We can use the first equation (A = 3H) to express Adrian's age in terms of Harriet's age, 
    *   A = 3H

* **Step 4: Solve for the age of Zack.**
   * We can use the second equation (H = (1/2)Z)  to express Zack's age in terms of Harriet's age. 
   *   H = (1/2)Z
   
* **Step 5: Calculate the average age of all three in three years.**
    * We are calculating the average age of all three in three years so we find their age in three years.


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Since Adrian's age is three times that of Harriet, Adrian is 3*21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.
In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.
The average age for the in three years will be 135/3 =<<135/3=45>>45 years

**2. Find Brianna's points:**

* Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

**3. Find the total points from Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**

* Total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna: 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 points. 

**4. Find Jojo's points:**

* Subtract the combined points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total score to find Jojo's score: 251 - 197 = 54 points.


{The final answer is 54}

Here's how we can break it down step-by-step:

**1. Determine Mom's Piece-Adding Rate**

* Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute.
* Mom's rate: Half of Kalinda's rate, so 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.

**2. Calculate Their Combined Rate**

*  Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate = Combined rate
*  4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

**3. Determine the Time to Complete the Puzzle**

* Total puzzle pieces: 360
* Combined rate: 6 pieces per minute
* Time = Total pieces / Combined rate 
* Time = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes

**4. Convert Minutes to Hours**

* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* Therefore, 60 minutes = 1 hour

**Final answer:** It will take them **1 hour** to complete the puzzle. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2
On average they get in 6 pieces per minute because 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6
It will take 60 minutes to complete the puzzle because 360 / 6 = <<360/6=60>>60
It will take one hour because 60 / 60 = <<60/60=1>>1

* * *

**Solution:**

1. **Initial Watermelon Stock:** Ashlyn started with 120 baby watermelons. 
2. **Ready for Harvest:** After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready, so 0.30 * 120 = 36 baby watermelons were ready.
3. **Melons Taken Home:**  Ashlyn took 36 baby watermelons home.
4. **Watermelon Remaining:**  After taking some home, the remaining watermelons were 120 - 36 = 84.
5. **Ready for Harvest After Two Weeks:**  3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, so 0.75 * 84 = 63 baby watermelons were ready.
6. **Watermelons Harvested:**  Ashlyn harvested 63 baby watermelons.
7. **Melons Not Ready:**  To find the melons not ready for harvest, we subtract the harvested watermelons from the total remaining watermelons, which is 84 - 63 = 21
 


{The final answer is 21}<end_of_turn><eos>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.
The number of watermelons remaining on the farm is 120-36 =<<120-36=84>>84
When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,
The number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21

Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the cars**

* Cost per car: $20,000 
* Number of cars: 12
* Total cost of cars: $20,000 * 12 = $240,000

**Step 2: Calculate the tax amount**

* Tax rate: 10%
* Cost of cars: $240,000
* Tax amount: $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost including the tax**

* Total cost of cars: $240,000
* Tax amount: $24,000
* Total cost including tax: $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000


**Step 4: Calculate the total registration cost**

* Registration cost per car: $1000
* Number of cars: 12
* Total registration cost: $1000 * 12 = $12,000

**Step 5: Calculate the total final cost** 

* Total cost including tax: $264,000
* Total registration cost: $12,000
* Total final cost: $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000


{The final answer is $276,000} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000

                    question:
                    Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes ! per month. Every day he has a ; 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 , days?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate daily calls**

* Jason makes a 15-minute call with his boss every day. 
* Daily calls = 15 minutes/call * 1 day/30 days = 0.5 calls/day.
 

**Step 2: Calculate total daily minutes**

* Total daily minutes = 0.5 calls/day * 15 minutes/call = 7.5 minutes/day

  
**Step 3: Calculate total call time**

* Total call time = 7.5 minutes/day * 30 days = 225 minutes.
  

**Step 4: Calculate remaining minutes**

* Total minutes used = Total call time + Extra minutes
* Total minutes used = 225 minutes + 300 minutes = 525 minutes

**Step 5: Calculate remaining minutes**

* Remaining minutes = 1000 minutes - 525 minutes 
* Remaining minutes = 475 minutes

 {The final answer is 475} 
 

<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes
Then subtract the minutes Jason has already used to find how many he has left: 1000 minutes - 450 minutes - 300 minutes = <<1000-450-300=250>>250 minutes

*This problem is going to be a little tricky. It requires multiple steps to break down and solve.*

**Here's how to solve it step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the number of fries Billy took:**
    * Kyle took 5 fries.
    * Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.

2. **Calculate the number of fries Colby took:**
    * Kyle took 5 fries.
    * Billy took 10 fries.
    * Colby took 3 less than Kyle, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

3. **Calculate the total number of fries Kyle, Billy and Colby took:**
    * Kyle took 5 fries.
    * Billy took 10 fries.
    * Colby took 2 fries.
    * Together, they took 5 + 10 + 2 = 17 fries.

4. **Calculate the total number of fries Griffin had starting:**
    * Griffin started with 24 fries.

5. **Calculate how many fries Griffin had left after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took theirs:**
    * Griffin had 24 fries.
    * Kyle took 5 fries.
    * Billy took 10 fries.
    * Colby took 2 fries.
    * Together they took 17 fries. {The initial problem asks about how many fries Ginger gave Griffin}.
    * Griffin had 24 - 17 = 7 fries left.

6. **Calculate how many fries Ginger gave Griffin:**
    * Ginger gave Griffin a handful, but Griffin started with 7 fries.
{The final answer is} Ginger gave Griffin 7 fries


<end_of_turn><eos>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27
Thus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries

If both aquariums have the same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?<end_of_turn>
* Provide a clear and accurate description of each step.

Let's break this down:

**1. Define Variables:** 
   * Let 's1' represent the number of snails in the first aquarium.
   * Let 's2' represent the number of snails in the second aquarium.
   * Let 'f' represent the number of fish in both aquariums.

  **Reasoning:** Identifying these variables with clear meanings makes the problem simpler to solve. 

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know s1 = 4 
   * We know s2 = 32
   * The problem states ""The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums...is twice the amount of fish"". This translates to  s2 - s1 = 2f. 
  
  **Reasoning:**  Turning the given information into mathematical forms, or equations, is the next step in mathematical problem solving.


**3. Solve the equations & find the number of fish:**
    * We can solve for 'f' using the equation s2 - s1 = 2f
    * Substitute the values of s1, s2 into the equation. 
    * Solve for 'f'

 **Reasoning:**  This step involves substituting numerical values into equations and working it out.


**4. State the answer with the final number of fish for each aquarium.** 
   
 **Reasoning:**   This brings the problem to an end.

**Here's the breakdown of the solution:**

1. **Calculate weekly cost:**
   * Hourly rate: $250
   * Hours per day: 6
   * Days per week: 4
   * Weekly cost = (Hourly rate * Hours per day * Days per week) 
   * Weekly cost = ($250 * 6 * 4) = $6,000 

2. **Calculate total cost for the movie:**
   * Total cost = Weekly cost * Number of weeks
   * Total cost = $6,000 * 5 = $30,000

3. **Calculate the discount amount:**
  * Discount percentage: 10%
  * Discount amount = (Total cost * Discount percentage)
  * Discount amount = ($30,000 * 0.10) = $3,000

4. **Calculate the final cost:**
  * Final cost = Total cost - Discount amount
  * Final cost = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

{The final answer is $27,000}

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Find how many cookies Sue ate on Monday.**

* Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
* Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
* Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

**2. Find how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.**

* Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
* She ate 20 cookies on Monday.
* She ate 20 * 2 = 40 cookies on Tuesday. 

**3. Calculate the total cookies Sue ate for both days.**

* Total cookies eaten = cookies on Monday + cookies on Tuesday 
* Total cookies eaten = 20 + 40 = 60 cookies

*   Dollar bills: 40 dollar bills * $1.00/bill = $40.00 

**3. Add the value of all the different types of coins and bills together:**

**4.  Write down the final answer:**
{The final answer is $45.00}


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites:**

*  30% of 400 pounds = (30/100) * 400 = 120 pounds.

**2. Calculate the weight of the remaining wood:**

* Weight of the redwood without termite damage = 400 pounds - 120 pounds = 280 pounds.

**3. Calculate the total weight of the wood in the entire redwood tree:**

* Since the redwood is 200 feet tall and each section is 10 feet, the total weight of the wood in the entire tree is 200 feet * 10 feet / section * 280 pounds/section = 56,000 pounds.

 
{The final answer is 56,000 pounds } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections
Then multiply the number of sections by the weight of each section to find the total weight of the redwood: 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = <<20*400=8000>>8000 pounds
Then find the amount of the wood the termites ate: 8000 pounds * 30% = <<8000*30*.01=2400>>2400 pounds
Then subtract that amount from the total weight of the wood: 8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = <<8000-2400=5600>>5600 pounds

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the overdue books:**
   - Each book costs $0.50 cents
   - She has 8 books
   - Cost of overdue books = $0.50 x 8 = $4.00

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The cost of overdue books is $4.00

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Find the number of bananas Jamal has:**

* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 apples - 8 = 44 apples.

**2. Find the number of bananas Jamal has:**

* Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 apples + 4 = 48 bananas.

**3. Find the total number of fruits Andrea has:**

* Andrea has 52 apples, and she has 48 bananas so Andrea has 52 apples + 48 bananas = 100 fruits.


**The final answer is 100 fruits** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits

**Step by step reasoning:**

1. **Define the problem:** Carla is making cookies, and needs a certain quantity of flour to bake them.


2. **Determine the total cups of flour needed:** We know that 2 cups of flour make a dozen cookies, and Carla is making 36 cookies.  We need to figure out how many dozens of cookies she needs to make.
   
3. **Calculate the total dozen cookies made:**  To find how much flour Carla needs, we'll first figure out how many dozens of cookies she'll make today and tomorrow.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

* **Step 1: Question about the initial number of marbles**
   We are asking how many marbles Maddison has *initially*. It is stated that each box has 50 marbles. How many boxes does she have?


* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles in the beginning**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the Brokerage Fee:**

* Multiply the selling price by the percentage of the brokerage fee: $350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

**2. Calculate the Transfer Fee:**

* Multiply the selling price by the percentage of the transfer fee: $350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

**3. Calculate the Total Price with Fees:**

* Add the brokerage fee and the transfer fee to the sales price: $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

**4.  Compare the Total Price to Mrs. Cruz's Budget:**

* Subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price with fees:  $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500


**The final answer is: $9,500** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.

*  Please provide the solution step by step.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate transfer fees:**
    *  Transfer fees = 3% of $400,000 
    *  Transfer fees = (3/100) * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate brokerage fees:**
    * Brokerage fees = 5% of $400,000
    * Brokerage fees = (5/100) * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Calculate total expenses:**
    * Total expenses = Transfer fees + Brokerage fees
    * Total expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4 **Calculate the net proceeds:**
    *  Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses - Loan amount
    *  Net proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $0


{The final answer is $0}

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the bedrooms windows in each house.**
    * 3 bedrooms per house * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows per house.

2. **Calculate the total windows in each house.**
   * 6 windows/house + 4 windows/house = 10 windows per house.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   * Cocoa: $4.20
   * Laundry: $9.45
   * Pasta: $1.35
   * Total Cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each ; sleeve take?<end_of_turn>
 
Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**

* The collar takes a tenth of the body stitches.
* Number of collar stitches = (1/10) * 900 stitches  
* Number of collar stitches = 90 stitches

**2. Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**

* The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
* Number of rosette stitches = 2 * 90 stitches
* Number of rosette stitches = 180 stitches

**3. Calculate the total stitches for the sweater:**

* Total stitches = Body stitches + Collar stitches + Rosette stitches
* Total stitches = 900 stitches + 90 stitches + 180 stitches 
* Total stitches = 1170 stitches

**4. Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**

* Total stitches - Collar stitches - Rosette stitches = Stitches for each sleeve 
* 1170 stitches - 90 stitches - 180 stitches = 800 stitches

**5. Final Answer:**

*  {The final answer is 800}



Let me know if you have any other questions! <end_of_turn><eos>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third . of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Identify the information:**
    * Song lines: 54 lines
    * Scene 1 lines: Twice the song lines, but a third of them are Sean's lines
    * Scene 2 lines: Six more than the song lines, and four-fifths are Sean's 

2. **Calculate scene 1 lines:** 
   * Sean's lines in scene 1 = (1/3) * (2 * 54 lines) 
   * Simplify: (1/3) * (108 lines) = 36 lines

3. **Calculate scene 2 lines:**
   * Scene 2 lines = 6 more than song lines: 54 + 6 = 60 lines

4. **Calculate scene 2 lines Sean memorizes:**
    * Sean's lines in scene 2 = (4/5) * 60 lines
    * Simplify: (4/5) * 60 lines = 48 lines. 

5. **Calculate the total lines:**
   * Total scene 1 lines + total scene 2 lines= lines Sean needs to memorize

   * 36 lines + 48 lines = 84 lines ,


 {The final answer is 84} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

* We know the current ages of Mico and Marco.
* We know the sum of their ages is 20. 
* We need to find the sum of their ages in 10 years.

**2.  Making an Assumption:**

*  Let's assume Mico's current age is ""M"" and Marco's current age is ""N"".


**3. Forming an Equation:**

*  We know the sum of their current ages is 20. 
*  Equation:  M + N = 20

**4.  Considering the Future:**

*  In 10 years, Mico's age will be (M + 10) 
*  Marco's age will be (N + 10)
*  The sum of their ages in ten years is: (M + 10) + (N + 10)

**5.  Expressing the Expected Outcome:**

* We can write the equation as:  M + N + 20

**6.  Relating the Current and Future Equations:**

*   We know that  M + N = 20
*   Substituting (M + N) with 20 on step 5, we get: (20) + 20=

*Think about it step by step.*

Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Set up Variables**

* Let 'R' represent Ruby's current age.
* Let 'S' represent Sam's current age.

**2. Formulate Equations**

* **Equation 1:** ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam."" This translates to the equation: R = 6S 
* **Equation 2:** ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam."" This translates to the equation: R + 9 = 3(S + 9) 

**3. Solve the System of Equations**

* We have two equations with two unknowns: R and S.  
* Substitute the value of R from Equation 1 into Equation 2: 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
* Solve for S: 
    * Expand: 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
    * Subtract 3S from both sides: 3S + 9 = 27
    * Subtract 9 from both sides: 3S = 18
    * Divide both sides by 3: S = 6
 


**4. Answer**

{The final answer is: Sam is 6 years old.} 
 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**1. Determine the combined length of topaz gems.**

* Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long. 
*  Therefore, the length of all topaz gemstones in a necklace is 8 gemstones * 1 inch/gemstone = 8 inches.

**2. Calculate the length of space to be filled with beads.**

* The necklace's total length is 25 inches.
* The topaz gemstones occupy 8 inches.
* So, the space left for beads is 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.


**3. Determine the number of beads per inch of space.**

* A silver bead is one-quarter inch long. 
* So, one inch of bead space has 17 inches / 0.25 inches/bead = 68 beads.



**4. Find the total number of beads per necklace.**

* Katerina uses 68 beads. Therefore, Katerina uses 68 beads per necklace.    



** {The final answer is 68}** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

<end_of_turn><eos>","In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.
In total, Alani had written 40+20 = <<40+20=60>>60 stories in the two weeks.
Braylen also wrote 40 stories in the first week, and on doubling that number in the second week the number became 2*40 =<<40*2=80>>80
His total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120
Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.
When Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.
In total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.
Altogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.

                    If Ann is 9 years old and ? her brother is twice , her age, , how old will her brother be in 3 years?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the brother's age:**

*  We know Ann is 9 years old.
*  The brother is twice her age, so his age is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

**2. Find the brother's age in 3 years:**

*  His current age is 18 years old.
*  In 3 years, he will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.


**The final answer is 21 years old.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Ann's brother is 9 * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 years old now.
This means, in 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = <<18+3=21>>21 years old.

                    Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 ? dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have : left?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:** 
    * One quarter is worth 25 cents. 
    * Kelly has 5 quarters, so their total value is 5 * 25 cents = 125 cents.

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
    * One dime is worth 10 cents. 
    * Kelly has 2 dimes, so their total value is 2 * 10 cents = 20 cents.

3. **Calculate the total value of Kelly's coins:**
    *  Add the value of the quarters and dimes: 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents.

4. **Calculate the amount remaining after buying the can of pop:**
    *  Subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total value of her coins: 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

 **The final answer is:** 90 cents 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1.  Identify the Pattern:**

*  Start by understanding the pattern of stars in the flag.

**2. Count the Stars in Each Row:**

*  Row 1: 8 stars
*  Row 2: 6 stars
*  Row 3: The remaining stars

**3. Total the Number of Stars:**

* To find the total number of stars in all the rows, we do this as we did in step 2

**4. Determine the Number of 5-Star Rows**

*  After counting the total number of stars, we can find out how many of them are 5-star.

**Solution:**
1. **Determine the total weight of the flagstones:** 
   - Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   - There are 80 flagstones.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the flagstones is 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds. 

2. **Determine the number of trucks needed.**
   - Each truck can carry 2000 pounds.
   - We need to divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight each truck can carry.
   - Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the speed of the car in the slow lane:**

* The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.
*  Speed of the slow lane car = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour. 

**2.  Set up a proportion to find the time of the slow lane car:**

*  Let  't' represent the time taken by the slow lane car.
* We know the distance traveled by both cars is the same (480 miles).


 **3.  Use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time**

*  We have the distance and the speed of the fast lane car, and can calculate the time taken (t).

 **4.  Calculate the time for the fast lane car**

*  Time = Distance / Speed 
*  Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

**5. Calculate the time for the slow lane car**

* We use the proportion from step 2 to find t:
 * 480 miles / 30 miles/hour  = time


{The final answer is 16 hours} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.

**2. Calculate the number of chocolate bars for adults:**

* 4 adults will get 6 chocolate bars each.
*  Total chocolate bars for adults = 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars

**3. Calculate the number of chocolate bars left for children:**

* Total chocolate bars – chocolate bars for adults = chocolate bars left for children
* 40 – 24 = 16 chocolate bars

**4. Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child gets:**

**3.  Calculate the time Susan spends on pauses:** 

*   She pauses for half an hour, which is 30 minutes.

**4.  Calculate the time Susan works continuously:**

*   Time actually working: 180 minutes - 30 minutes = 150 minutes

**5.  Calculate the earnings per minute:**

*   Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate total rice consumption per meal:** 
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - 5 members eat rice twice a day.
   - Total rice consumption per day: 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg 
2. **Calculate total rice consumption per week:**
   - Total consumption per day: 0.4 kg
   -  Number of days in a week: 7 days.
   - Total weekly consumption: 0.4 kg/day * 7 days = 2.8 kg
3. **Determine the number of weeks the bag of rice will last:**
   -  Weight of the bag of rice: 42 kg
   - Total weekly consumption: 2.8 kg
   - Number of weeks: 42 kg / 2.8 kg/week = 15 weeks


**The final answer is 15 weeks.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Let's break down how we can calculate this.

**1. Analyze Known Sales:**

* **Target:** 120 crates 
* **Weekend Sales:** 20 crates
* **Closed Days:** Monday and Friday
 
**2. Calculate Daily Sales:**

* **Tuesday:** 15 crates
* **Wednesday:** 12 crates
* **Thursday:** 18 crates
 
**3. Calculate Total Sales (excluding weekends):**

  *  15 crates + 12 crates + 18 crates = 45 crates

**4. Calculate the Difference:**

*  Total sales (excluding weekends) = 45 crates
*  Target = 120 crates
*  Difference = 120 crates - 45 crates = 75 crates


  **{The final answer is 75 crates}**

* We don't know exactly how many bids Carmen makes. 
* We should consider the pattern.


**4. Calculate the Cost**


* Since the bids always rise by $50 each time, Carmen consistently bids the amount to win.



Let me know if you want to see a worked example! 

<end_of_turn><eos>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

                    John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day. ?  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 . per mile driven and he ? also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?<end_of_turn>
*One mile is equal to 5,280 feet.*

Here's my thought process:

1. **Calculate total miles driven per week:**  The problem states he goes to work and back each day, which means he drives 30 miles each way, for a total of 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles each week.
2. **Calculate total miles driven per year:** He drives 60 miles/week * 52 weeks/year = 3120 miles per year.
3. **Calculate total cost of mileage:**  His cost per mile is $2.00, so his cost per year is 3120 miles * $2.00/mile = $6240.
4. **Calculate the cost of the monthly bonus:** The driver gets a $150 bonus per month, which is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800 per year.
5. **Calculate total cost for the year:**  Add together the cost of mileage and the bonus to find the total cost of the service per year: $6240 + $1800 = $8040


{The final answer is $8040} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week
So he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week
That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year

Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Determine the basic unit.**

*  The fundamental building block for this paper layout is a single page.

**Step 2: Count the pages and the folding.**

*  A standard tabloid has 32 pages.
*  We are folding the paper vertically, meaning we're essentially taking a single sheet of paper and dividing it into two components. 

**Step 3: Determine the relationship between the paper, pages, and folds. **

* Each fold divides the paper into two halves.
* Therefore, with each fold, the paper is divided in half, and these halves become the pieces you would use.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **First Year's Sales:**
   - Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as this year. 
   - This implies that she sold 45 books * 2 = 90 books in the first year.

2. **Total Books Sold:** 
   - She sold 90 books in the first year.
   - She has 50 unsold books.
   - Total books sold = 90 + 50 = 140 books

3. **Total Amount Earned:**

                    question:
                    Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the : population of Chile was half what it is now. Currently, Cera is 46 years old. If the population of Chile six ! years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, calculate , the population of Chile now.<end_of_turn>



**Reasoning:**

1. **Find Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old. 
   - Six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
2. **Find Noah's age six years ago:**
   - We know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Let's use Noah's age six years ago to formulate an equation.  
3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago. 
   - We can represent this mathematically as: Population of Chile (six years ago) = 3000 * Noah's age six years ago

4. **Relate the population to Noah's age:**
    -  We know Noah's age six years ago, and this was a representation of the population of Chile six years ago.
5. **Solve for Noah's age six years ago:** 
    - We can use this equation and the information about Cera's age and population to solve for Noah's age six years ago.
6. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - When we know Noah's age six years ago, we can plug this information in to the equation from step 3, and find what the population of Chile six years ago was based on Noah's age. 
7. **Calculate the population of Chile now:** 
   - We can use what we know about Cera's age, the population six years ago, and the fact that the population has not changed. We can plug in information to get the current population of Chile. 


**Final Answer:** {The final population of Chile now is 3000} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

Here's how I solved this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  ""x"" represent the number of players on the defense.

**2. Set Up Equations Based on the Given Information:**

* **Offense:** There are twice as many players on offense as defense, so the number of players on offense is 2 * x 
* **Special Teams:**  There's half as many players on special teams as there are on defense, so the number of players on special teams is (1/2) * x
* **Total:** The total number of players is 105, so  x + 2x + (1/2) * x = 105

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3.5x = 105
* Divide both sides by 3.5: x = 30

**4. Answer:**
 
{The final answer is 30 } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense
Offense:2x
Special Teams:(1/2)x
Total:x+2x+(1/2)x=105

*Step 1:* Identify the given information.
*Step 2:* Define the variables we want to use.
*Step 3:* Set up the expressions to solve for the total weight.
*Step 4:* Finalize the calculations and state the final answer.

Let's break it down!



**Step 1: Identify the given information**

* Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
* He has 50 marbles in the store.
* His father gave him 2/5 times as many as Solomon bought from Johanna.


**Step 2: Define the variables**

* Let  'x' be the number of marbles given by Solomon's father.
* Let 'y' be the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.


**Step 3: Set up the expressions to solve for the total weight**
* Solomon's marbles: y = 20 + 50 
* Father's marbles: x = (2/5) * 20 = 8 
* Total weight: (weight of marbles from Solomon) + (weight of marbles from Father)  = (20*2) + (50*2) + (8*2)
 * The final weight.

 **Step 4: Finish the calculations**

* Total weight = (20*2) + (50*2) + (8*2)
* Total weight = 40 + 100 + 16
* Total weight = 156

{The final answer is 156 kilos}

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**

*  **Area of the bottom:**  Length x Width = 6 feet x 4 feet = 24 square feet
*  **Volume:** Area of the bottom x Depth = 24 square feet x 5 feet = 120 cubic feet

**2. Calculate the cost of filling the pool:**

*  **Cost per cubic foot:** $0.10
*  **Total Cost:** Volume x Cost per cubic foot = 120 cubic feet x $0.10 = $12.00


{The final answer is $12.00}

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Find the number of girls:**

* Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys. 
* The number of girls = 3 * 30 boys = 90 girls

**2. Find the number of nongendered children:**

* The classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys.  
*  Number of Nongendered children = (1/10) * 30 boys = 3 Nongendered children 

**3.  Find the total number of children:**

* Total children = number of boys + number of girls + number of nongendered children
* Total children = 30 boys + 90 girls + 3 Nongendered children = 123 children


**The final answer is 123 children** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.
The classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.  This means for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

**2.  Use the Information Given:**

* We know the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

**3. Set up a Proportion:**

* We can use this ratio to find the number of poles needed!
* The ratio of poles to wires is: 1 : 3 
* Since wires are calculated to be 45, we need to find how many poles we need

**4. Solve for the Number of Poles:**
* To find the number of poles we can set up a proportion:
   * (number of poles) / (number of wires) = 1/3
*  We know the number of wires is 45 so, 
    * (number of poles) / 45 = 1/3
*  Multiply both sides of the equation by 45 to isolate the number of poles:
    * (number of poles) = 45 * (1/3) 
*  Simplify to find the number of poles.

       



Let me know if you'd like me to expand any of the steps further. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1.  Calculate the total number of people at the start:**

*  Men: 25
*  Women: 15
*  Total: 25 + 15 = 40 people

**2. Calculate the number of people who left:**

*  1/4 of 40 people = (1/4) * 40 = 10 people

**3.  Calculate the number of people left:**

*  Total people - People who left = People left
*  40 - 10 = 30 people

**4.  Calculate the number of women left:**

*  Number of women at start - women who left = Number of women left
*  15 - 10 = 5 women

{The final answer is 5 women} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.

Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds ; 15 milliliters of cream?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

* Shannon's method cools the coffee, but it also weakens it in a separate way. 
* We need to calculate the final strength and volume of the coffee. 

**2.  Break Down the Impacts:**

* **Cooling:** The coffee cools by 65 degrees. 
* **Volume Weakening:**  Each ice cube makes the coffee more diluted (weaker) by 12 ml. 
* **Cream Addition:** Added cream at 15 ml will further dilute the coffee.


**3.  Calculations:**


* **Step 1: Calculate the total volume weakening effect of the ice cubes.**
    * 65 degrees cooling * 12 ml/degree = 780 ml of coffee weakening effect.

* **Step 2: Consider the combined effect of cooling and cream.**
    * Total volume weakening due to both effects = 780 ml + 15 ml = 795 ml.

Here is the solution:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.

2. **Account for the lollipops eaten on the way to school:**  He eats 2 lollipops, leaving him with 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

3. **Calculate the lollipops given to friends:** He gives away 14 lollipops.

4. **Calculate the lollipops purchased on the way home:** He purchases twice the number he gave away, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.

5. **Calculate the lollipops after buying:**  He has 22 + 28 = 50 lollipops.

6. **Account for the lollipops eaten after buying:** He eats 3 more lollipops, leaving him with 50 - 3 = 47 lollipops.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Understand the Rate:**

* The phone gains 1% charge in every 3 minutes. 
* This means we're dealing with a consistent rate of increase, which is linear.

**2. Calculate the Charge Increase:**

* We know the phone is currently at 60% charge.
 
**3. Determine Time to Reach Full Charge**
*  We need to figure out how much time it takes to reach 100% charge. 

**4. Apply the Rate and Find the Number of Minutes:**

* We can directly calculate the number of minutes needed by using the formula:
   * *Time = (Desired Charge / Charge Increment) * 3*

   * Where:
     * Desired charge is 100% (or 1)
     * Charge Increment is 1%

   * Time = (1 / 0.01) * 3


**5. Convert the Time to Hours:** 


*  Determine the time in minutes, then convert to hours. 



{The final answer is 30 minutes}

*  For every $20 spent, the customer gets $1 off.
*  They spent $80 on their last trip, so they get $1 / $20 * $80 = $4 in rewards.

**2. Calculate the coupon discount:**

*  The coupon took twice the amount of rewards off the price. 
*  They had $4 in rewards, so the coupon discount was $4 * 2 = $8. 
 

**3. Calculate the price after the coupon discount:**

*  Total spent = $43

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate Yearly Earnings for Job A**

* Hourly rate: $15
* Hours per year: 2000

* Yearly earnings = Hourly rate * Hours per year 
* Yearly earnings = $15 * 2000 = $30,000

**Step 2: Calculate Total Taxes for Job A**

* Tax Rate: 20%
* Yearly earnings: $30,000

* Total taxes = Tax Rate * Yearly earnings
* Total taxes = 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000

**Step 3: Calculate Yearly Earnings for Job B**

* Yearly earnings = $42,000

**Step 4: Calculate Total Property Taxes for Job B**

* Property taxes: $6,000

**Step 5: Calculate Net Income for Job B**

* Net Income = Yearly earnings - Property taxes
* Net income = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

**Step 6: Calculate Total Taxes for Job B**

* Tax Rate: 10%
* Net income: $36,000

* Total taxes = 0.10 *$36,000 = $3,600

**Step 7: Calculate Net Pay at Job B**

* Net Pay = Net income - Total taxes

* Net Pay = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400


**Step 8: Find the Difference in Net Pay**

* Net Pay for Job A:  $30,000
* Net Pay for Job B: $32,400


 * Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $30,000 = $2,400


 {The final answer is $2,400} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

1. **Calculate the initial investment:** 
   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each, so the total initial investment is 8 shares * $8/share = $64. 

2. **Calculate the increase in the first year:**
   - A 50% increase means the price increases by 0.50 * $8 = $4 per share.

3. **Calculate the price after the first year:**
   - The price of each share increases to $8 + $4 = $12.
   - The total value of the shares after one year is 8 shares * $12/share = $96.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understanding the Setup:**

* We have three groups of students.
* Two groups are equal in size. 
* The last group is smaller, 10 fewer students than each of the other groups.

**2. Setting up variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
 

**3. Forming equations based on given information:**

*  The total number of students is 200, so: x + x + (x - 10) = 200 

**4. Solve for the number of students in each group:**

* Combine the like terms: 3x - 10 = 200
* Add 10 to both sides: 3x = 210
* Divide both sides by 3:  x = 70

**5. Finding the size of the smallest group:**
 
* The smallest group has 'x - 10' students.
* Substitute and solve: 70 - 10 = 60


{The final answer is 60} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

*   Let `c` represent the number of chickens.
*   Let `v` represent the number of cows.

**Step 2: Set up Equations Based on Given Information**

*   **Equation 1:**  We know that  `c = 2v` (Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows).
*   **Equation 2:**  We know the total number of animals is `c + v = 60` (All animals are chickens or cows).

**Step 3: Solve for One Variable**

* We can solve for `c` in Equation 1: 
   `c = 2v`
*  To isolate `c`, divide both sides by 2:
   `c = v`

**Step 4: Substitute the Result**

* Now substitute the value of `c` (which is now equal to `v`) into Equation 2:
   `v + v = 60`

**Step 5: Solve for the Remaining Variable**

*  Simplify the equation: 
   `2v = 60`
*  Divide both sides by 2:
   `v = 30`

**Step 6: Find the Number of Chickens**

*  Use the equation `c = v`  and the value of `v`:
   `c = 30`

**Step 7: Calculate the Total Number of Legs**

*   Chickens have 2 legs each.  
*   Cows have 4 legs each.
*   Total legs: `2c + 4v = 2 * 30 + 4 * 30 = 60 + 120 = 180`


{The final answer is 180} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.
There are 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cows.

*How many balls does Josh start with?*
*How many balls does Josh end up juggling?*
*How many balls does Josh start with and lose?*




**Here's my attempt at problem-solving:**

*Step 1: Identify the starting number of balls*
*Josh begins with 3 balls.*

*Step 2:  Find the number of balls he adds each week*
*Josh adds 1 ball each week, so he adds 1 ball per week.*

*Step 3: After how many weeks?*
*Josh juggles for 4 weeks.*

*Step 4: Calculate balls lost*
*Josh loses 3 balls.*




**Final Answer is:** The final answer is: 
*Josh begins with 3 balls.*
*After the fourth week, he juggles 3 balls.* 
*Josh loses 3 balls


<end_of_turn><eos>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7

                    question:
                    ! A pink frog weighs the : same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than ! a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight . of a container carrying one of each . animal if the container also weighs 20 ; pounds.<end_of_turn>
{The solution}

**1.  Determine the weight of the yellow snake:** 
   * The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and that's the same as the weight of the blue beetle. 
   * Therefore, the yellow snake weighs 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds.

**2. Determine the weight of the red bird:**
   * The pink frog weighs 50 pounds, and that's 20 pounds less than the weight of the red bird. 
   * Therefore, the red bird weighs 50 pounds + 20 pounds = 70 pounds.

**3. Calculate the total weight of all the animals in the container:**
   *  Pink frog: 50 pounds
   *  Blue beetle: 50 pounds
   *  Green toad: Unknown
   *  Yellow snake: 60 pounds
   *  Red bird: 70 pounds
   *  Total weight:  50 + 50 + the weight of green toad + 60 + 70 = 250 pounds

**4. Account for the weight of the container:**{The final answer is} 250 pounds + 20 pounds = 270 pounds. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

   - Laurel received twice the amount as the given outfits, so she received 24 * 2 = 48 outfits.

2. **Calculate the total number of outfits after the shower:**
   - Laurel has 48 outfits from the shower + 15 outfits from her mom = 63 outfits.

3. **Determine the final number of outfits:**
  - Laurel has a total of 63 outfits for her baby.


{The final answer is 63.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits

## Step by Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate cookies in lunch box:**  
    - Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box per day.
    - 4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies/week
 
2. **Calculate husband's cookies:**
    -  Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days.
    - 1 cookie/day * 7 days/week = 7 cookies/week

3. **Calculate total cookies lost:**
    -  Jenny puts 20 cookies in her son's lunch box.
    -  Her husband eats 7 cookies / week.
    - Total cookies lost = 20 cookies+7 cookies 
    
 
4. **Calculate remaining cookies:**
    - If Jenny buys one bag of cookies with 36 cookies. 
    - Cookies used in lunch box + cookies used by husband  =  remaining cookies
    - 20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the original cost of the shirts.**

* Cost of one shirt: $30
* Number of shirts: 2
* Original cost of both shirts: $30 x 2 = $60

**Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.**

* Discount percentage: 40%
* Original cost: $60
* Discount amount: $60 x 0.40 = $24

**Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original cost.**

* Original cost: $60
* Discount amount: $24
* Final cost: $60 - $24 = $36


{The final answer is $36} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.
The total discount on the 2 shirts is $60 x 0.40 = $<<60*0.40=24>>24.
Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $60 - $24 = $<<60-24=36>>36.

*  Three times longer is 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.

**2. Calculate the Thursday museum tour duration:**

* The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class.
*  3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours

 **3. Calculate the total duration of all activities:**

* Total hours = (Yoga Monday) + (Cooking Class Tuesday) + (Cheese tasting Wednesday) + (Museum Tour Thursday) + (Errands Friday)

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the number of rose pots:**

* April needs twice as many rose pots as daisies, so she needs 30 pots * 2 = 60 rose pots.

**2. Calculate the total number of plant pots needed:**

*  She needs 30 daisies pots + 60 rose pots = 90 plant pots. 

**3. Calculate how many plants pots April already had:**

* She had 100 plant pots before starting.

**4. Determine the number of plant pots April has left over:**

The height of the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. How tall is the tallest tree?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the height of the second tree:**
   * The second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so its height is 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.

2. **Find the combined height of the two shorter trees:**
   * The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

3. **Calculate the height of the tallest tree:**
   * The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so its height is 17 feet * 2 = 34 feet.


{The final answer is 34 feet} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.
Thus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.
Therefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.

Here's how I'd solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the cost of the toy cars:**

* Cost per toy car: $2
* Number of toy cars: 6
* Total cost of toy cars: $2 * 6 = $12

**2. Calculate the cost of the teddy bears:**

* Cost per teddy bear: $1
* Number of teddy bears: 5
* Total cost of teddy bears: $1 * 5 = $5

**3. Calculate the total amount spent before the extra money:**

* Total cost of toy cars: $12
* Total cost of teddy bears: $5
* Total cost before extra money: $12 + $5 = $17

**4. Calculate the total amount after the extra money:**

* Total amount before extra money: $17 
* Extra money: $10
* Total amount after extra money: $17 + $10 = $27

**5. Calculate the money left:**

* Total amount after extra money: $27
* Money spent on toys: $17
* Money left:  $27 - $17 = $10

{The final answer is $10} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears × $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.
Adding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.
Dean has $38 − $17 = $21 left.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the total cost of mini-golf:**

*  A round of mini-golf costs $5.
*  She wants to have one round.
*  Total cost of mini-golf: $5

**2. Calculate the cost of arcade tokens:**

*  She has $5 for arcade tokens.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the cost of one lollipop:** The lollipops cost 25 cents each.
   * {The cost of one lollipop is 0.25.}

2. **Calculate the total cost of four lollipops:**  
   * {4 lollipops * 0.25/lollipop = $1}

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total purchase price of the candy.**
*   Billy spends $10.
*  The candy cost $1.5 per pound. 
*   We want to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.
*   Formula:  Total purchase price = Cost of candy * Number of pounds

**2. Calculate the change Billy receives.**
*   Total purchase price = $10.00
*   Change = Total purchase price - Cost of candy
*   Change = $10.00 - ($1.50 * Number of pounds)

**3. Calculate how much money Billy spends on gumballs.**
*   He buys 40 gumballs and they cost $0.05 each. 
*   Formula: Cost of gumballs = Number of gumballs * cost per gumballs

**4. Use the change Billy receives to figure out the number of pounds of candy purchased.**

* Billy takes half his change and spends it on gumballs.
*   Formula: Change = Amount spent on gumballs
*   We can now use the above information to find the number of pounds.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent Carver's son's age.
* Let 'y' represent Carver's age. 

**Step 2: Set up an Equation**

We are given that: 
   *  ""Carver just turned 45 years old, which makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son.""
   *  This translates to the equation: y = 2x - 5

**Step 3: Solve for the Age of the Son** 

* We know that 'y' is equal to Carver's age, which is given as 45.
* Substitute this into the equation: 45 = 2x - 5 
* Solve for 'x':
    * Add 5 to both sides: 50 = 2x
    * Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

 **Step 4: State the Answer** 
 * Carver's son is 25 years old.


 {The final answer is 25}   
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

Here's the breakdown problem-by-step:

**1.  Define the Variables:**

*   Let x represent the distance from the second city to the third city.
*   Consider the combined distance from the second city to the third city to be x + 50. 
 
**2. Understand the Distances:**

*   Distance 1: 75 miles (from the first to the second city)
*   Distance 2:  x + 50 miles (from the second to the third city) 
*   Distance 3: 75 + (x + 50) miles (from the third to the first)


**3. Relate the Total Distance:**

To find the total distance travelled daily, we add up the distances for each leg of the trip.


**4. Determine Service Frequency:** 

* The train requires service every 18,000 miles.


**5. Solve for the Number of Days:** 

*We will calculate the total distance travelled by the train and divide it by its service interval to determine the number of days it takes for the train to complete the entire schedule.


 



<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

**Here's the breakdown of the problem and how we can solve it:**

1. **Define the variables:** 
   * Let  'x' be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. 
   
2. **Set up the equations:**
   *  ""A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting"" →  x = 4x - 5 
   *  ""Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale"" → 3x = 3 * (4x - 5)

3. **Solve for 'x' :**
   * ** Combine like terms: 3x = 12x - 15**
   * **Isolate the 'x' terms: 15 - 12x = 0**
   * **Solve for 'x': -12x = -15**
 
    * **Divide both sides by -12:** x = 1.25  



4. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons:**
    * Subtracting the customers who were kicked out for mask refusal would give us the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.  
    * **The total customers kicked out:** 50 
    * **Customers kicked out for mask refusal:** x = 1.25

    * **The number of customers kicked out for other reasons:** 50 - 1.25 = 48.75

*Hint: use variables to help solve this problem.*

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the number of points Erin had before.
* Let 'y' represent the number of points Sara has before. 


**2. Write equations based on the given information:**

* We know that Erin has three times more points than Sara:  x = 3y 
* We know that Erin scored 14 points, and Sara scored 8:   x - 14 = y


**3. Solve for the variables:**

* We now have two equations:
    * x = 3y 
    * x - 14 = y
* We can substitute the first equation into the second:
    * 3y - 14 = y

How much will be spent on the senior gifts?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the cost of frames:**

* Number of frames needed: 44 seniors * 1 frame/senior = 44 frames
* Cost of each frame: $20
* Total cost of frames: 44 frames * $20/frame = $880

**2. Calculate the etching cost:**

* Etching cost per frame: $20 * 0.20 = $4
* Total etching cost: $4/frame * 44 frames = $176

**3. Calculate the cost of pins:**

* Cost per pin: $5 
* Number of seniors receiving pins: 44 seniors * 2 pins/senior = 88 pins 
* Total cost of pins: 88 pins * $5/pin = $440

**4. Calculate the cost of cords for officers:**

* Number of officers: 44 seniors * (1/4) = 11 officers
* Cost per cord: $12/cord
* Total cost of officer cords: 11 officers * $12/cord = $132

 
**5. Calculate the total cost**

* Total cost of frames + etching + pins + officer cords = $880 + $176 + $440 + $132 = $1638


{The final answer is $1638.} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.
Total cost for the senior's picture frames is 44 seniors * $24 = $<<44*24=1056>>1056.
The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.
The total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.

**Solution**

1. **Identify the initial sales:**  We know the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.

2. **Calculate doubled sales:** On Saturday, they sold double the amount from Friday, meaning 14 pairs * 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.

3. **Calculate the final sales (Wednesday):** The store sold half the amount from Saturday, so 28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

4.**Account for returned pairs:** The initial number of pairs sold is 14 + 28 = 42 pairs.  
  6 people returned the shoes, meaning that 42 - 6 = 36 pairs were sold.

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Determine the practice time on Tuesdays**

* Hallie had a 1-hour practice on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the practice time on Saturday**

*  Hallie's Saturday practice was twice as long as her Tuesday practice.
*  Twice the duration of a Tuesday practice is 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours. 

**Step 3: Find the total practice time on the days where Hallie practiced**

* Tuesday practice: 1 hour
* Thursday practice: 2 hours 
* Saturday practice: 2 hours
* Total practice time: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours.

*Note: The total number of faulty pieces of equipment is irrelevant.*

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces:**
    * 40% of $400,000 is (40/100) * $400,000 = $160,000
2. **Subtract the cost of faulty equipment from the total cost:**

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Divide the Sheep:**

* Mary has 30 sheep. 
* She gets milk from half the sheep, so she has 30 / 2 = 15 sheep providing milk.

**2. Milk from Half the Sheep:**

* She gets 1 kg of milk from 15 sheep, So she gets 1 kg/15 sheep= 1/15 kg of milk from each sheep.
 
**3. Milk from the Other Half:**

* The other half of sheep = 30/2 = 15 sheep.
* She gets 2 kg of milk from each of these 15 sheep.

**4. Total Milk from Both Halves:**

* The total milk from the half sheep is 1/15 kg/sheep * 15 sheep = 1 kg

**Solution**

1. **Start with the initial amount:** Mrs. Sherman begins with 12 bread rolls. 

2. **Subtract the rolls given to the children:** She gives away 6 rolls, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 rolls left. 

3. **Divide the remaining rolls into pieces:**  She broke each roll into 8 pieces.  So, she divided 6 rolls into 8 pieces each, resulting in 6 / 8 = 0.75 rolls.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Figuring out the apples sold on Monday.**

* We know Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday at $4 each.
* Let's use the variable *x* to represent the number of apples she picked on Monday. 
*  We know that *x* represents the number of apples sold on Monday
* Revenue earned from Monday's sales is: *4x*.


**Step 2: Finding the number of apples picked on Tuesday.**

*  Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday
 
**Step 3: Determining the number of apples picked on Wednesday.**

* Lucy picked double the apples she picked on Tuesday.

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest**

*  Interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Time (in years)
*  To calculate interest, we need interest rate in decimal form which is 10% = 0.10
*  We need to convert time to year (5 months is 5/12 = 0.416667 yr) 
* This makes:  Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * 0.416667 = $150
*

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment** 

*  Total amount to pay = Principal + Interest 
*  Total amount to pay = $3,650 + $150 = $3,800


**Step 3: Determine the monthly payment**

*  Monthly Payment = Total Amount to pay / Number of months
*  Monthly Payment = $3,800 / 5 = $760


{The final answer is $760} .

   * Profit/hour = Total revenue/hour - Total costs
   * Profit/hour = $4/hour - $18/hour = -$14/hour

 


That's the answer
{The final answer is -$14/hour}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.
She sells all of the lemonade for 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36.

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 ; of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. How much land did he have at first?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* We know Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
* This means he has 12.8 hectares left. 
* Our goal is to find the original size of his land.

**Step 2: Define a Variable**

Let  ""x"" represent the original size of Mr. Ruther's land.

**Step 3: Translate the Known Information into an Equation**

* He sold 3/5 of his land, so the land remaining is represented by (1 - 3/5)x
* Given we know he has 12.8 hectares left, we have the equation: (1 - 3/5)x = 12.8 


**Step 4: Solve for the Original Land Size (x)**

* Simplify the left side of the equation: (2/5)x =12.8
* Multiply both sides by (5/2)to isolate x: x = 12.8 * (5/2)
* Calculate: x = 32


**Step 5: State the Answer:**
The final answer is 32 hectares. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

How many people sang in the performance?<end_of_turn>
*Remember to show all your steps.*

**Step 1:**  Calculate the number of boys in the choir.
    *  50% of 52 members = (50/100) * 52 = 26 boys

**Step 2:** Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
    *  50% of 52 members = (50/100) * 52 = 26 girls

**Step 3:** Determine the number of female members singing.
     * Since 50% are girls, there are 26 girls.
 
**Step 4:** Determine the number that can't attend the show. 
     * Half of the choir members can't attend = (1/2) * 52 = 26 people

**Step 5:** Determine the number of remaining members. 
     * Number of remaining members are 26 girls


**Step 6:** Final answer
     * The final answer is 26 girls  


<end_of_turn><eos>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

                    An eraser costs $2 and a pencil costs : $3. How . much do 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of one eraser**

* We know an eraser costs $2. 

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of one pencil**

* We know a pencil costs $3.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of 6 erasers** 

*  Multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers.
* 2 dollars/eraser * 6 erasers = $12

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of 8 pencils**

* Multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils.
* 3 dollars/pencil * 8 pencils = $24

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost**

* Add the cost of 6 erasers and the cost of 8 pencils 
* $12 + $24 = $36

 {The final answer is $36} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Six erasers cost $2/eraser x 6 erasers = $<<2*6=12>>12.
Eight pencils cost $3/pencil x 8 pencils = $<<3*8=24>>24.
So, 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost $12 + $24 = $36.

**Detailed Reasoning**

1. **Calculate the number of ticket costs.** David buys a ride bracelet for $30 which gives him 9 rides.
2. **Calculate the cost of riding 9 rides with tickets.**
3. **Compare the cost of the bracelet with the cost of buying 9 tickets.**
4. **Find the difference between the price of the bracelet and the price of 9 tickets.**

**Detailed Solution:** 


1. **Calculate the cost of riding 9 rides with tickets.** 
   * The cost of each ride ticket is $2.
   * David needs 9 tickets for the rides
   * Cost of 9 ride tickets is $2 x 9 = $18.

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1:  Define variables**

* Let  'x' represent the number of popsicles Betty has. 
* Let 'y' represent the number of popsicles Sam has.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

* We are given that the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6.  This means: x/y = 5/6
* We are given that together they have 165 popsicles: x+y = 165

**Step 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other**

* Solve the second equation for 'x':  x = 165 - y 
 
**Step 4: Substitute the expression into the first equation**

* Substitute the value of 'x' from step 3 into the first equation: (165 - y) / y = 5/6

**Step 5: Solve for 'y'**

* Cross-multiply: 6(165 - y) = 5y
* Distribute: 1015 - 6y = 5y
* Combine like terms: 1015 = 11y
* Solve for 'y': y = 92

**Step 6: Substitute 'y' back into the equation for 'x'**

* x = 165 - y
* x = 165 - 92
* x = 73

**Step 7: Find the difference between Sam's and Betty's popsicles**

* Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = y - x
* Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 92 - 73 
* Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 19


{The final answer is 19} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.
Since Betty has 5/11 of the total number of popsicles they have together, she has 5/11*165 = <<5/11*165=75>>75 popsicles.
Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the time spent recording.**

* Carol spends half the time writing, so she spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours recording. 

**Step 2: Convert all times to minutes.**

* Carol spends 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes writing.
* Carol spends 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes recording.
* Carol spends 90 minutes editing.

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on writing, recording, and editing.**

* Total time = 240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage of time spent editing.**

*  ((Editing time / Total work time)) * 100%
* ((90 minutes / 450 minutes)) * 100% = 0.20
* 0.20 * 100% = 20%

1. **Find the number of millipedes:**
   -Nancy has 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. 
   -So, Nancy has (1/3) * 90 = 30 millipedes.

2. **Find the number of stink bugs:**
   - Nancy has twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   - So, Nancy has 2 * 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs.

3. **Calculate the total number of bugs:**
   - Nancy counted 90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs.


{The final answer is 168 bugs.} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes
Then multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs
Then subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs
Then add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs

## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the starting information:**  We know the following:
    * Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
    * Beth is 5 years older than Erica. 
    * Erica is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Beth's age:**
    * Beth is 5 years older than Erica, who is 30.
    * Therefore, Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old.

3. **Establish Alice's age:**
    * Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
    * Therefore, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old. 

4. **Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:**
   * Alice is 42 and Erica is 30.
    * The difference between their ages is 42 - 30 = 12.

**{The final answer is 12}**

{The final answer is}


Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* We need to find the difference between the number of flour bags and milk bottles Mark needs to buy.
* We know the recipe requires 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
* Flour is sold in bags of 2 cups, and milk is sold in bottles of 2 cups.

**2. Identify the Key Quantities**

* **Flour:** 3 cups needed per batch. 
* **Milk:** 1 cup needed per batch. 

**3.  Calculate the Number of Bags Needed**

* Number of bags needed of flour = Total cups of flour / Cups per bag
* Number of bags needed of flour = 3 cups / 2 cups/bag  = 1.5 bags 

**4. Calculate the Number of Bottles Needed**

* Number of bottles needed of milk = Total cups of milk / Cups per bottle
* Number of bottles needed of milk = 1 cup / 2 cups/bottle = 0.5 bottles

**5. Find the Difference**

* Difference = (Number of bags of flour) - (Number of bottles of milk)
* Difference = (1.5 bags) - (0.5 bottles) 
* Difference = 1 bag

 


{The final answer is} 1 bag. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.
To get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy: 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = <<12/2=6>>6 bags
To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

*Explain each step of your reasoning.*

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the daily energy consumption:**
   - The AC uses 900 watts per hour.
   - He uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption: 900 watts/hour * 8 hours/day = 7200 watt-hours 
 
2. **Calculate daily energy savings:**
   - He reduces the use by 5 hours a day.
   - Daily energy consumption reduction: 7200 watt-hours * (5 hours / 8 hours) = 4500 watt-hours 

3. **Calculate total energy savings over 30 days.**
   - Total daily energy savings: 4500 watt-hours/day  * 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours

4. **Convert watt-hours to kilowatts and hours.**
   - 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) = 1000 watt-hours (Wh)
   - Therefore, 135,000 watt-hours = 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatt-hours (kWh)

5. **Final answer:** {The final answer is 135 kilowatt-hours}




Let me know if you'd like further explanation. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total number of stripes for each zebra:**

* Zebra 1: 17 stripes
* Zebra 2: 17 stripes
* Zebra 3: 36 stripes
* Zebra 4: 17 stripes / 2 = 8.5 stripes

**2. Add up the stripes from all the zebras:**

* 17 + 17 + 36 + 8.5 = 88.5 stripes

**3. Divide the total striped count by the number of zebras to find the average number of stripes:**

* 88.5 / 4 = 22.125 stripes 


 **The final answer is:** 22.125

*Step 2:  Set up an equation with unknown*
*Step 3: Solve for the unknown*
*Step 4:  State the answer*


Let's break it down:

*Step 1: Identify the known information*
   - Each sandwich needs: 1 pound of meat, 1 pound of cheese
   - Each sandwich serves: 4 people
   - Total people watching the game: 20
   - Meat price: $7.00 per pound
   - Cheese price: $3.00 per pound

*Step 2: Set up an equation with unknown*
   - I need to figure out how much meat and cheese he'll need to make 20 sandwiches. 
   - We know that each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
   - We need to determine the total amount of meat and cheese required to make enough for 20 servings.  
**To do this, we'll use a basic formula to calculate how much we need.**


*Step 3: Solve for the unknown*
   - **Meat:** Since each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and there are 20 people watching, we need to calculate how much meat is needed.

    - He has twice as much corn as cannolis, so Allan has 40 * 2 = 80 corn.

2. **Find the number of corn after buying more:**
    - Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so he has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.
 
3. **Find the number of corn after buying less:**
    - Allan has 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis. So, he has 100 - 40 = 60 corn.

He also went for a short jog ; around the block and realized that after he had finished his jog, he only had . 2,000 steps left . to take. ! How many steps did Elliott take ? during his jog?<end_of_turn>
    
Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Consider the steps from school and friend walk.**

* Elliott did half of his steps on the way to and from school, which means he took 10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps on those walks.

**Step 2:  Add the school / friend walk steps to the jog. **

* Elliott had  5,000 steps + 1,000 steps = 6,000 steps. 
 

**Step 3:  Calculate the steps after the school / friend walk.**

* Elliott started with 10,000 steps and finished with 2,000 steps remaining, so he had 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps 


**Step 4:  Determine the steps dedicated to the jog.**

 * Elliott took 8,000 steps - 6,000 steps = 2,000 steps. 




{The final answer is: 2,000 steps} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

**Here's how we break down the problem:**

1. **Define variables:**
    * Let 'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees.
    * Let 'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
    * Let 'c' represent the number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
    
2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  From the problem statement:
      * a = 30/2 *a  ( Joanne gathers half as many from the shortest trees as the tallest trees.) 
      * c = a+b  ( Joanne gathers more apples from the average trees than the shortest trees.) 
      * c = 3 * c  (Her sister gathers twice as many from the tallest trees as Joanne)

4. **Use the given information and your calculated values to find the number of apples from the average trees:**

5. **State the final answer** 



Let me know if you'd like me to walk you through any of the step further.  
<end_of_turn><eos>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'c' represent the number of camels.
*  Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

* **Heads:** We know the total number of heads is 180. So, c + d = 180 
* **Bumps:** We know the total number of bumps is 304. So, 2c + d = 304

**3. Solve the System of Equations:**

We can use a substitution or elimination method. Here's how we'll use substitution:

* **Solve the first equation for 'c':** 
  c = 180 - d 

* **Substitute this value of 'c' into the second equation:**
  2(180 - d) + d = 304

* **Simplify and solve for 'd':**
    360 - 2d + d = 304
    360 - d = 304
    -d = -56
    d = 56

 


**4. Answer the Question:**

 The final answer is {There are 56 dromedaries.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

**Solution:**
1. **First week's kilometers:**  
    * Days 1-4: 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km
2. **Second week's kilometers:**
    * Days 5-7: 300 km/day * 3 days = 900 km

{The final answer is}

**Solution**

1. **Find the size of Zack's locker:** 
    * Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. 
    * This means:  Peter's locker size = (1/4) * Zack's locker size 
    * We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches:  5 cubic inches = (1/4) * Zack's locker size

2. **Solve for Zack's locker size:**
    * Multiply both sides by 4: 5 cubic inches * 4 = (1/4) * Zack's locker size * 4
    * Simplify: 20 cubic inches = Zack's locker size

3. **Find Timothy's locker size:**
    * Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. 
    * This means: Zack's locker size = (1/2) * Timothy's locker size
    * We know Zack's locker size is 20 cubic inches: 20 cubic inches = (1/2) * Timothy's locker size

4. **Solve for Timothy's locker size:**  
    * Multiply both sides by 2: 20 cubic inches * 2 = (1/2) * Timothy's locker size * 2
    * Simplify: 40 cubic inches = Timothy's locker size


 **Answer: ** Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

{The final answer is}


Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the starting and ending points:**

* Stanley starts at 10,000 feet.
* The comb falls to 3,000 feet.

**2. Calculate the height difference:**

* The comb falls 10,000 feet – 3,000 feet = 7,000 feet.

**3. Determine the distance Oliver needs to climb:**

Since the comb fell 7,000 feet, Oliver needs to climb 7,000 feet.


**Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.**




<end_of_turn><eos>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.
Thus Oliver, who was at an elevation of 3,000 feet, must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = <<6000-3000=3000>>3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and the solution:

**Step 1: Determine the amount from the second bank.** 
The second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank, so:
* Twice the amount from the first bank = $4000 * 2 = $8000

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount from both banks.**
* Total amount received from both banks = $4000 + $8000 = $12000

**Step 3: Determine the current capital balance.**
* Current capital balance = Initial capital + total Bank funds
* Current capital balance = $5000 + $12000 = $17000

**The final answer is $17000** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the second bank gave him twice as much money as the first bank, he received 2*$4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000 from the second bank.
The total amount of money Mr. Josue got from the two banks is $8000+$4000 = $<<8000+4000=12000>>12000

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of cats taken away:** 
    * Four boats picked up 5 cats each, so they carried away 4 * 5 = 20 cats. 

2. **Calculate the number of cats remaining:**
    * Start with the initial number of cats: 50 cats.
    * Subtract the cats taken away: 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

3. **Calculate the number of cats that ran after the mouse:** 
   * (3/5) * 30 = 18 cats 

4. **Calculate the final number of cats remaining:**
   * Subtract the cats that ran after the mouse: 30 - 18 = 12 cats.


**The final answer is:** 12 cats were left on the rock. 


 
<end_of_turn><eos>","When four boats carried away 5 cats each, the total number of cats that left the rock is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cats.

After 8 months of the normal rate, the ! service increased its price to $14 a month. How much do 2 years of the service cost him?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the introductory price**

*  He pays $8 per month for 6 months.
*  Cost for 6 months = $8/month * 6 months = $48

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the 8 months at the normal price**

*  He pays $12 per month for 8 months.
*  Cost for 8 months = $12/month * 8 months = $96

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the price increase**

*  The price increases to $14 per month.
*  Cost for 1 month at new rate = $14/month

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the first 14 months**

*  Total cost for first 14 months = $48 + $96 = $144 

**Step 5: Calculate the cost for the next 2 years (24 months)**

*  We find the total cost for the first 14 months
*  The cost for 2 years = $144 + (24 * $14)

**Step 6: Calculate the final answer** 

*  The final answer is $144 + (24 * $14) = $144 + $336 = $480



<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.

   * So, the total cost for both pairs is $22 + $28 = $50.

**Step 3:** Calculate the amount that Cole saved on the jeans. 
   * He saved a total of $6.

**Step 4:**  Calculate the amount of the savings for the jogger jeans.
   * He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   *  So, he saved (1/3) * $6 = $2 dollars.

**Step 5:** Calculate the total amount saved from the tattered jeans.
   * He saved the rest from the tattered jeans.
   * The amount saved from the tattered jeans is $6 - $2 = $4.

**Step 6:** Calculate the original price of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans.


**Step 7:** Calculate the difference between the original prices.
   * The original price of the tattered jeans is $28. 
   * The original price of the jogger jeans is $22.
   *  The difference between the originals price is $28 - $22 = $6.




<end_of_turn><eos>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Buses:**

* Capacity of each bus: 60 employees
* Number of buses: 4
* Total capacity of buses: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

**2. Minibuses:**

* Capacity of each minibus: 30 employees
* Number of minibusses: 6
* Total capacity of minibusses: 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

**3. Minivans:**

* Capacity of each minivan: 15 employees
* Number of minivans: 10
* Total capacity of minivans: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

**4. Total Capacity:**

*  Add the number of employees each vehicle type can carry together.
* Total employees: 240 employees + 180 employees + 150 employees = 570 employees {The final answer is 570}

How many birds can Lillian expect to see in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1. Calculate the total number of bird feeders:**

* Lillian builds 3 feeders.
* She buys 3 more feeders.
* Total feeders: 3 + 3 = 6 feeders

**2. Determine the extra birds attracted by homemade feeders:**

* Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than store-bought ones.
* So, each homemade feeder attracts 20 birds + 10 birds = 30 birds.

**3. Calculate the total birds attracted to all feeders:**

* Total birds per feeder based on store-bought feeders: 20 birds
* Total birds per feeder based on homemade feeders: 30 birds 
*  Total birds per feeder: 20 + 30 = 50 birds. 
 
**4.  Calculate the total birds attracted to all 6 feeders:**

* Total birds per feeder: 50 birds.
* Total feeders: 6
* Total birds: 50 birds/feeder * 6 feeders = 300 birds


**The final answer is 300 birds** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the price of the soup.**

*  The soup is 25% more expensive than the bagel. 
*  25% of $4 = (25/100) * $4 = $1
*  The price of the soup is $4 + $1 = $5.

**Step 2: Calculate the price of the cake.**

*  The cake is half the price of the bagel.
*  Price of the cake = $4 / 2 = $2.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the dinner.** 

*  Total cost = Price of bagel + Price of soup + Price of cake.
*  Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. 



**The final answer is $11.**<end_of_turn><eos>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who wanted two hot dogs.**

* Half of the guests wanted two hot dogs: 36 guests / 2 = 18 guests.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of hot dogs prepared.**

* The caterer prepared enough for half the guests to have two hot dogs: 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hot dogs. 



**Step 3:  Calculate the number of guests who received their second hotdog.**

* The caterer provided enough hot dogs for everyone to have two.


**Step 4: Determine the number of guests who did not request a second hotdog (i.e., they only wanted one).**

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the weight of each piece:** Divide the total cake weight by the number of pieces: 20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.
2. **Determine the weight of the individual portions:** Since both Rory and her mom have a piece, the total weight of their portions is 2.5 ounces/piece * 2 pieces = 5 ounces.
3. **Calculate the remaining cake weight:**  Subtract the weight of the portions from the total cake weight: 20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces. 

**The final answer is:** 15 ounces

The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound. He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, that are also on sale for $2.00 a box.  What is the cost per serving? (Round ; to the nearest integer.)<end_of_turn>
* **Step 1:**  Calculate the amount of onions Antoine wants to buy.
* **Step 2:** Calculate the total amount of onions needed.
* **Step 3:** Calculate the total cost of the onions. 
* **Step 4:** Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.
* **Step 5:** Calculate the total cost of the recipe.
* **Step 6:** Divide the total cost of the recipe by the number of servings to find the cost per serving. 



Let's break it down:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of onions Antoine wants to buy.**
* Antoine wants to double the amount of onions called for in the recipe. 
*  2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of onions needed.**
* Antoine wants 4 pounds of onions. 

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the onions.**
* Price per pound: $2.00 
* Total onions needed: 4 pounds 
*  Cost of onions = $2.00/pound * 4 pounds = $8.00


**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the beef stock.**
* Price per box: $2.00
* Number of boxes needed: 2 boxes 
* Cost of stock = $2.00/box * 2 boxes = $4.00

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the recipe.**
* Cost of onions: $8.00
* Cost of stock: $4.00
* Total recipe cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

**Step 6: Divide the total cost of the recipe by the number of servings to find the cost per serving.**
*   Total cost of recipe: $12.00
*   Number of servings: 6 
*  Cost per serving = $12.00 / 6 = $2.00


{The final answer is $2.00} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions
Onions are currently on sale for $2.00 a pound so they will cost 4*2 = $8.00
He needs 2 boxes of stock which are also on sale for $2.00 so they will cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
The onions are $8.00 and the stock is $4.00 for a total of 8+4 = $<<8+4=12.00>>12.00
The soup serves 6 people and the total cost is $12.00 so each serving is 12/6 = $<<12/6=2.00>>2.00 a serving

The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel. If it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, how much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how to break down the problem:**

1. **Understand the Relationships:** 
   - Wayne travels a shorter distance to the theater compared to Bernadette. 
   - This journey time is crucial for determining the necessary early departure time for Bernadette.
2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let `x` represent the driving time for Bernadette.
3. **Set up the Equation:**
    -  ""The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel"" 
    -  This can be translated as: `x = 4 * 4` 
    -  Therefore, `x = 16` minutes.
4. **Determine the Time Difference:**
    - We know Wayne takes 4 minutes to travel to the theater. 
     - Bernadette needs to be 5 minutes before Wayne.
5. **Calculate Bernadette's Departure Time:**

     - Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne.
     
     Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 - 4 = 1 minute before Wayne.




{The final answer is 1 minute.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.
Her ride takes 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 minutes longer than Wayne’s to get to the theater.
Thus, she should leave 12 + 5 = <<12+5=17>>17 minutes before Wayne to get to the theater 5 minutes sooner than he does.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Convert Yard to Feet**

* There are 3 feet in 1 yard.
*  The length of the bedroom is 3 yards, so its length in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet.

**2. Find the Width**

* The area of a rectangle is length times width. 
* We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (9 feet).
*  Width = Area / Length = 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet.

**3. Calculate the Perimeter**

* The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width.
* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (9 feet + 40 feet) = 2 * 49 feet = 98 feet.


{The final answer is 98 feet.}<end_of_turn><eos>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.
The width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.
The room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98

How many more beads do one . sister , have than the other, if , each pack of : beads contains 20 pieces of ; beads?<end_of_turn>
*The question asks for the difference in the number of beads between the two sisters, so you’ll need to compare their bead totals.


**Step 1: Calculate Elizabeth’s total beads**

* Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads + 2 packs of clear beads = 3 packs of red and clear beads.
* Each pack contains 20 beads.
* Therefore, Elizabeth has 3 packs * 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
 

**Step 2: Calculate Margareth's total beads**

* Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads + 4 packs of red beads = 7 packs of blue and red beads.
* Each pack contains 20 beads.
* Therefore, Margareth has 7 packs * 20 beads/pack = 140 beads.

**Step 3: Find the difference in bead values**

*The difference is calculated by subtracting the number of beads the lesser sister has from the number of beads the more valuable sister has.
 
* Margareth has 140 beads – 60 beads = 80 more beads.
 



**The final answer is:** Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.

Then Marcus : opens a window , for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. What is the house's final temperature?<end_of_turn>


**Solution**

1. **Calculate the temperature increase from baking:**
   * The oven is on for 3 hours, so it runs for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
   * The temperature increases by 5 degrees per hour, so it increases by 5 * 180 = 900 degrees.

2. **Calculate the temperature at the end of baking:**
   * The initial temperature was 40 degrees.
   * The temperature increases by 900 degrees.
   * The final temperature after the baking is 40 + 900 = 940 degrees.


3. **Calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window:** 
   * The window is open for 30 minutes, for 30 / 60 = 0.5 hours.
   * The temperature cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.
   * The cooled degree is 2 * 0.5 = 1 degree.

4. **Calculate the final temperature after the window is opened:**
   * The final temperature is 940 - 1 = 939 degrees.


**The final answer is 939 degrees** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate Jon's Total Triathlon Time**

* Swim time: 40 minutes
* Bike time: 1 hour 20 minutes = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes
* Run time: 50 minutes 
* Total time for Jon: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

**2.  Determine James's Time Components**

*  Swim time: Increase by 10% of the original Jon's swim time. We need to calculate this first 
* Bike time: 5 minutes longer than Jon's bike time.

**3. Calculate Jon's Swim Time**

* Increase in Jon's swim time by 10% 
* We need to calculate the amount of Jon's swim time an increase of 10% of it.


**4. Calculate James's Bike Time**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let  'x' represent the length of Movie C in hours. 
* Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B's length is x + 5 minutes
* Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A's length is (1/4)(x + 5)

**Step 2: Express Movie C's length in minutes**

* Movie C is 1.25 hours, so its length in minutes is  1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.


**Step 3:  Determine Movie B's length in minutes**

* Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it's length is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the distance the horse runs in miles.**

*  He runs for 30 minutes.
*  30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour)
*  Speed is 32 MPH. 

**Find the distance the horse runs in miles using the following formula:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 32 MPH x 0.5 hours 
* Distance = 16 miles

**2. Determine the total hay needed.**

* The horse needs 1/2 a bail of hay per mile.
* He needs 16 miles of hay. 
*  Hay Needed = 16 miles x (1/2 bail/mile)
*  Hay Needed= 8 bails

**3. Calculate the cost of the hay.**

*  One bail of hay costs $3
*  He needs 8 bails of hay
*  Total Hay Cost = 8 bails x $3/bail
*  Total Hay Cost = $24

**4.  Determine Michael's starting cash balance.**

*  He has six 5 dollar bills
*  Each bill is worth $5.
*   Total Starting Cash = 6 x $5 = $30

**5. Calculate how much change Michael has.** 

*  Total Cost of Hay: $24
*  Michael's Starting Balance: $30
*    Change = Total Starting Cash - Total Hay Cost
*   Change = $30 - $24 = $6

 {The final answer is $6}



<end_of_turn><eos>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total number of eggs:**

* A dozen is 12 eggs, so 4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.
* She also has 2 loose eggs, so the total number of eggs is 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

**2. Calculate the number of trays she can put out:**

* Each tray holds 5 glasses and each glass needs 5 eggs. 
* Therefore, she can put out 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 trays.

{The final answer is 10 trays} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

What's the regular ? price : of popcorn if the soda costs $3 and : you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving , $2?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Set up Variables**

*  Let  'x' represent the regular price of popcorn. 

**2. Define the Scenarios**

* **Scenario 1: Super Ticket** 
   * Cost:  $20
   * Includes popcorn free and soda. 
* **Scenario 2: Regular Ticket**
   * Cost: $12
   * You buy one popcorn and one soda at regular price. 


**3. Formulate Equations**
* Since you save $2 by choosing the regular ticket, we can express this as an equation: 
   * $20 - $12 =  $8  (This represents the savings from the super ticket compared to the regular ticket)


**4. Isolate the Popcorn Price**

* Since we know the regular ticket cost and the soda cost, we can calculate the cost of popcorn using the scenarios. 
 
 


{The final answer is $4} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21
If I didn't buy the ($21) super ticket but bought everything included on it and still saved $2, then I spent in total $21-$2 = $<<21-2=19>>19
If the regular movie ticket costs $12 and the soda costs $3 then the popcorn would cost $19-$12-$3=$4

old price per balloon:
new price per balloon:
cost of filling 170 balloons after price increase:


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Determine the old price per balloon:**

* We know the cost of 20 balloons at the old price was $900.
* This means each balloon cost $900 / 20 = $45.   
     
**2. Determine the new price per balloon:**

* The price of each balloon increased by $20.
* Therefore, the new price per balloon is $45 + $20 = $65.

**3. Calculate the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase:**

*  The new price per balloon is $65.
*  Thus, the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase is $65 * 170 = $11050 



{The final answer is $11050}<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45

If Bentley had 170 balloons that he wanted to fill, after the price increase, Bentley paid 170*$65=$<<170*65=11050>>11050 to fill 170 balloons.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define the Trip**

* We know the car's initial speed is 60 mph. 
* We know the duration of the first period is 2 hours.
* We know its second period is 1 hour. 
* We need to find the average speed. 


**2. Calculate Distance for Each Segment**

* **Segment 1:**  
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 2 hours 
   - Distance = 120 miles

* **Segment 2:** 
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 mph × 1 hour
   - Distance = 30 miles

**3. Calculate the Total Distance for the Trip**

* Total Distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2
* Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
* Total Distance = 150 miles

**4. Calculate Average Speed**

* Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
* Average Speed = 150 miles / (2 hours + 1 hour)
* Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
* Average Speed = 50 mph {The final answer is}



 Let me know if you'd like to work through any other problem! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.

*Step-by-step reasoning:*

1. **Determine the value of the rubies:**
   * Jenna traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
   * Since rubies are worth $1200 per ruby, the value of the rubies is 2 * $1200 = $2400. 

2. **Determine the original value of the sapphires:**
   * Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.
   * The value of the sapphires is 8 * $800 = $6400. 

3. **Calculate the total value of the jewels:**
   * The value of the rubies is $2400.
   * The value of the sapphires is $6400. 
   * Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is $2400 + $6400 = $8800.

{The final answer is $8800}

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

How much will the potting soil cost him?<end_of_turn>
    

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the volume of one raised bed:**

* **Volume = width × length × height**
* Volume = 2 feet × 8 feet × 2 feet 
* Volume = 32 cubic feet

**2. Calculate the total volume of soil needed:**

* **Total volume = volume per bed × number of beds** 
* Total volume = 32 cubic feet × 10 beds
* Total volume = 320 cubic feet

**3. Calculate the number of bags of potting soil needed:**

* **Bags needed = total volume ÷ volume per bag** 
* Bags needed = 320 cubic feet ÷ 2 cubic feet/bag
* Bags needed = 160 bags

**4. Calculate the total cost:**

* **Cost = number of bags × cost per bag**
* Cost = 160 bags × $12/bag

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the number of green cards:**

* 60% more than red cards means 15 * 0.60 = 9 more green cards.
* Total green cards: 15 + 9 = 24 cards.

**2. Determine the number of yellow cards:**

* Yellow cards equal the sum of red and green cards: 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

**Here's how we can solve this step by step:**

1. **Calculate the weight of each item:**
   * Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
   * Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
   * Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
   * Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

2. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**
   * Total weight = Sugar cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats 
   * Total weight = 2 pounds + 48 pounds + 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds  = 4590 pounds 

3. **Determine how many trips the truck can carry:**
   * The truck can carry 2250 pounds.


**4. Divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity:**
   * Number of trips = Total weight / Truck capacity
   * Number of trips = 4590 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip 
   * Number of trips = 2 trips 


**The final answer is**: The farmer needs 2 trips to transport all the feed. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

*The given information is as follows:*
* **Basketball Cards:** 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 cards
  * **Baseball Cards:** 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 cards


**Step 1:** Calculate the total number of basketball cards.
**Step 2:** Calculate the total number of baseball cards.
**Step 3:** Subtract the cards Miss Maria keeps and the remaining cards to students from the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards.
**Step 4:** Divide the number of cards left by the number of cards each student received.

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Becky's total cost**

* Cost per apple: 45 cents
* Number of apples: 20
* Becky's total cost: 45 cents/apple * 20 apples = $9

**2. Calculate the discount Becky received**

* Discount amount: $1

**3. Calculate Kelly's total cost.**

* Cost per apple: 50 cents
* Number of apples: 20
* Kelly's total cost: 50 cents/apple * 20 apples = $10

**4. Calculate Kelly's discount.**

* Discount percentage: 10 percent
* Discount amount: (10/100) * $10 = $1


**5. Calculate Kelly's total cost with the discount.** 

* Kelly's total cost: $10 - $1 = $9

**6. Compare the costs** 

* Becky's total cost: $9
* Kelly's total cost: $9


**7. Determine the difference**


 * The difference between the costs is $9 - $9 = $0.


{The final answer is $0} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

Here's how to approach the problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the key components:**

* **Sheets:**  2 per room
* **Comforters:** 1 per room 
* **Pillow Cases:** 2 sheets * 2 = 4 pillow cases per room
* **Towels:** 4 pillow cases * 2 = 8 towels per room

**2. Calculate the individual laundry loads:**

* **Comforters:** 80 rooms * 1 = 80 comforters
* **Pillow Cases:** 80 rooms * 4 pillow cases/room = 320 pillow cases
* **Towels:** 80 rooms * 8 towels/room = 640 towels

**3. Account for all items:**

* **Total Laundry:** 160 sheets + 80 comforters + 320 pillow cases + 640 towels = {1,040 pieces of laundry}

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1.  Calculate total shoes gained:**

*   Monday: 5 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 10 shoes
*   Wednesday: 15 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 30 shoes
*   Friday: 30 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 60 shoes
*   Total gained: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes

**2. Calculate total shoes after Saturday:**

*   Starting total: 200 shoes
*   Shoes lost on Saturday: 180 shoes
*   Total after Saturday: 200 - 180 = 20 shoes

**3. Calculate the total shoes Frank will have on Sunday**


*   Shoes gained + shoes before Saturday: 100 shoes
*   Total after Saturday: 20 shoes
 


{The final answer is 120 shoes} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

             **Step 3**: Determine the number of pencils remaining at the end of the year.
             **Step 4**: Find the final answer



Let's break this problem down step by step:

**Step 1: Determine the number of pencils used.**

* We are told that 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
* To find this, we can multiply the starting number of pencils by the fraction representing how many pencils were used: 30 students * (1/5) = 6 pencils used.

**Step 2: Determine the number of pencils remaining after two months.**

*  After two months, 6 pencils were used, so we need to subtract that amount from the original number: 30 pencils - 6 pencils = 24 pencils.

**Step 3: Determine the number of pencils remaining at the end of the year.**

* We are told that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left at the end of the year.
* Therefore, we multiply the number of pencils remaining by the fraction representing the proportion of pencils remaining at the end of the year:  24 pencils * (1/3) = 8 pencils.

 **Step 4: Find the final answer.**


{The final answer is 8 pencils.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.

Thus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.
Therefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Set up the equation:**

* Let ""x"" represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats. 
* Cookies = (x) * 0.5 + 2

**2. Use the information about the total cookies:**

* Matt wants 5 cookies total.
* This means 5 = (x) * 0.5 + 2  

**3. Solve for x:** 

* Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: 
   5 - 2 = (x) * 0.5
* Simplify:
   3 = (x) * 0.5

* Divide both sides by 0.5:
   3 / 0.5 = (x) 
* Simplify:

*Hint: Remember to use proportions*

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the knowns:** 
   * We know the length of the shark is 10 feet. 
   * We know the length of each remora is 6 inches.
2. **Convert all measurements to the same unit:**
   * Convert 10 feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 10 feet = 10 * 12 = 120 inches.
   *  Convert 6 inches to inches. 
3. **Set up a proportion:** 
   *  Let's use the proportion 
      * length of remora/length of shark = length of remora/length of shark 
   *  Where length of remora equals 2 * 6 inches 
4. **Calculate the length of the remora:** 
   * length of remora = 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.
5. **Substitute values into the proportion:** 
   * 120 inches / 120 inches = = 12 inches / 120 inches
6. **Calculate the percentage:** 
   * To find the percentage, divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark, and multiply by 100% 
   *   = (12 inches / 120 inches) * 100% 

   * This is simplified to    = 1%   




Final answer: {The final answer is 1% } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

                    Tom decides to give his wife an anniversary getaway.  The plane tickets cost $5000 each. ?  The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend.  The normal price is . $1500 : per day.  If they are there for 3 days how much . did the trip cost?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the hotel:**
   * 20% of $1500 = (20/100) * $1500 = $300
   * The hotel price for 3 days = $1500/day * 3 days = $4500
   * The hotel price with the extra cost: $4500 + $300 = $4800. 
     

2. **Calculate the total cost for the plane tickets:**
   * Cost of 2 plane tickets = $5000/ticket * 2 tickets = $10000

3. **Calculate the total cost of the entire getaway:**
   * Total cost = $10000 (plane tickets) + $4800 (hotel) = $14800

 {The final answer is $14800}
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal
So they paid 1500+300=$<<1500+300=1800>>1800 per night
That means she paid 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
The plane tickets cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10,000
So the total cost is 10,000+5400=$<<10000+5400=15400>>15,400

**Step 1: State the objective.**

The objective of the problem is to determine how much more money Keegan and Tashay need to earn to reach their goal of $200. 


**Step 2: Find the total amount they have earned.**

We know that Keegan earned $83, and Tasha earned $91.
Total amount earned = Keegan's earnings + Tasha's earnings
Total amount earned = $83 + $91 = $174

**Step 3: Calculate how much more they need to earn.**

To find out how much more they need to earn, we subtract their total earnings from their goal. 
Amount needed = Goal - Total earnings
Amount needed = $200 - $174 = $26

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Find how many songs Luri owns.**

* Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so multiply Gabriel's songs by 3.
* 20 songs * 3 = 60 songs 

**2. Determine the difference in the number of songs.**

* Subtract Luri's songs from Gabriel's songs.

 Saltar 

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Define the variable**

* Let 'x' represent the cost of Jillian's shoes.

**Step 2: Set up the equation**

*  The problem states: ""Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost.""
* This translates to the equation: 3x - $20  = handbag cost

 **Step 3: Solve the equation for the handbag cost**

* We know shoes cost $80, so we substitute that into the equation:  3x - $20 = handbag cost
* We also know shoes cost $80, so we can substitute that: 3x - $20 = handbag cost 

**Step 4: Solve for the handbag cost** 
* To find the handbag cost, we need to solve for 'x' in the equation 3x - $20. 
* However, we know shoes cost $80. So, we use that to find the handbag cost.

**1. Calculate the price of two packs:**

* Cost per pack: $4.00
* Number of packs: 2
* Total cost: $4.00 x 2 = $8.00

**2. Calculate the cost of the razors with the buy one, get one free deal:**

* Since we're buying 2 packs, the ""buy one free"" means we get 2 razors for the price of 1
* This means the price after the deal is $4.00 x 2 = $8.00

**3. Calculate the total discount:**

* Coupon: $2.00

 
**4. Calculate the final price per razor:** 

* Initial cost: $8.00
* Total discount: $2.00

* Final price per razor: $8.00 - $2.00 = $6.00
 

**5. Convert the final price to cents:**


* $6.00 = 600 cents.

* Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour.
* She works for 8 hours a day.
* Total walking time per day: 5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the total walking time over 5 days**

* Total walking time per day: 40 minutes
* Number of days: 5
* Total walking time: 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes

**The final answer is:** 200 minutes 


<end_of_turn><eos>","She works 8 hours every day and she sets a timer to walk 5 minutes every hour for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes of walking
If she walks 40 minutes a day while at the office then over 5 days she walks 40*5 = <<40*5=200>>200 minutes

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine Brett's age in four years**
* Brett is currently 14 years old.
* In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.

**2.  Find Angela's age in four years**
* Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years.
* In four years, Angela will be 18 * 3 = 54 years old.

**3. Find Angela's current age**
* Angela will be 54 in four years.
* To find her current age, subtract four years from the age in four years
* Therefore, Angela is currently 54 - 4 = 50 years old.

The problem is asking for the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car. It asks for the total cost of morning and afternoon rides for 14 days.

**Step 1: Determine the cost of morning rides.**

* Paul does morning rides at a cost of $6.
* He does them 2 times a day, so per day, he spends $6.
*  over 14 days, his cost for morning rides is $6/ride * 2 ride = $12/day 


**Step 2: Determine the cost of afternoon rides.**

* Paul does afternoon rides at a cost of $2.
* He does them 2 times a day, so per day, he spends $2.
*  over 14 days, his cost for afternoon rides is $2/ride * 2 ride = $4/day.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost over the two weeks.**

* His total cost for morning rides is $12/day * 14 days = $168 
* His total cost for afternoon rides is $4/day * 14 days = $56


 {The final answer is $224} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.
Driving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.
So in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.

*I am sure your process will need some logic and a little math.*


**Here's how we can breakdown the problem:**

1. **Find how many oranges Ashley brought:**
    * Ashley brought 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges
2. **Find how many oranges Brianne brought:**
    * Brianne brought 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges. 
3. **Calculate the total number of oranges they have:**
    *  They have 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges.
4. **Determine the number of Greek Orange Pies they can make:**
    * They can make 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 Greek orange pies

  **{The final answer is 40}** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.
Brianne brought 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 oranges.
Thus, they have 50 + 70 = <<50+70=120>>120 oranges altogether.
Therefore, they can make 120 /3 = <<120/3=40>>40 greek orange pie.

At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are ; necessary for the two venues : to be equal in cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Define the Costs:**

* **Venue 1 Cost:** $200 (flat fee) + $5/person (food) * x (number of guests)
* **Venue 2 Cost:** $25/person * x (number of guests)

**2. Set Up the Equation:**

The cost of both venues should be equal.  Therefore:
$200 + $5x = $25x

**3. Solve for x:**

* Subtract $5x from both sides: $200 = $20x 
* Divide both sides by $20: x = 10

 


**Answer:** {The final answer is 10}<end_of_turn><eos>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the information given.** We are told that Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
2. **Calculate the total yards used by Mariah.**  
    *  We know Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and there are 364 yards per skein.
    *  To find out how many yards Mariah used, we multiply: (1/4) * 364 yards/skein = 91 yards.
3. **Calculate the total yards used by both, Mariah and her grandma.**
    *  We know Mariah used 91 yards, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein.
    *  To find out how many yards her grandma used, we multiply: (1/2) * 364 yards/skein = 182 yards.
    *  To get the total, we add the yards used by each person. Therefore: 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards{The final answer is} 273 yards. 

 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

* The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug's width is 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.

**2. Find the width of the rug in terms of twice the rug's width:**

* Twice the rug's width is 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet.

**3. Find the length of the couch:**

* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the rug's width. 
* Therefore, the couch's length is 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1.  Break down the costs:**

*   The total cost of all the gum is $7.
*   She paid $2 for the grape gum.
*   The cost of the green apple gum is half the price she paid for the grape gum, so she paid $2 / 2 = $1 for the green apple gum.


**2. Calculate the cost of strawberry gum:**


*  Subtract the cost of the green apple gum from the total amount she paid to get the cost of the strawberry gum.
*    $7 - $2 - $1 = $4 


**3. Determine the cost of each strawberry gum pack:**

*  Divide the cost of the strawberry gum by the number of strawberry gum packs.
*    $4 / 2 = $2


**The final answer is $2 per pack of strawberry gum.** 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
Thus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

                    For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. : by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If . Andy needs to burn ; 3500 calories to lose a ? pound, how much ; of a calorie , deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?<end_of_turn>
  
Here's a breakdown of how I arrived at the answer:

**1. Calculate the remaining days:**

*   Andy's birthday is July 19th.
*   Today is December 31st.
*   Remaining days: 31 (Dec) - 31 (Dec) + 19 (July) = 19 days

**2. Calculate total calories to burn:**

*  Calories needed: 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories.


**3. Calculate calories deficit per day needed:**

*  Calories deficit = Total calories to lose / Number of days
*  Calories deficit = 105,000 calories / 19 days = 5,368 calories/day 
 
{The final answer is 5,368 calories/day}. 

<end_of_turn><eos>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

{ ? - $100}

**Step 4: Find the unknown number of days in a week through the given information.** 
* We calculate total pay for the week through the given information about total earnings and salary.

 


**The final answer is:** { $30/day * ? days} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210
He spent $100 leaving him with $210-$100 = $110

Here's how to solve the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the total distance:**

*  Each lap is 0.25 km.
*  She runs 8 laps.
*  Total distance = 0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km

**2. Calculate the total water needed:**

*  Hannah drinks 60 ml/km.
*  Total water needed = 60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml

**3.  Answer:** 

* Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water. 
{The final answer is 120 ml} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km

                    ? A house and : a lot cost $120,000. ; If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Identify knowns:**
   * The total cost of the house and lot is $120,000.
   * The house costs three times as much as the lot. 

**2.  Define variables:**
   * Let  'x' represent the cost of the lot. 
   * The house costs three times the lot, so the house costs 3x

**3. Set up an equation:**
   * The total cost of the house and lot is equal to the sum of the cost of the house and the lot. 
   *  3x + x = $120,000

**4. Solve the equation for the house cost:**
   * Combine like terms: 4x = $120,000
   * Divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000

**5. Find the house cost:**
   * The house costs 3x, so the house costs 3 * $30,000 = $90,000. 


**Final Answer:** The house cost $90,000. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

Ali gives her sister half of the total money he has and uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy : dinner. Calculate the amount ; of money he has after buying the dinner.<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}



Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.**

* $10 bills: 4 bills * $10/bill = $40
* $20 bills: 6 bills * $20/bill = $120
* Total: $40 + $120 = $160

**2. Calculate the amount Ali gives to his sister.**

* Half of the total amount: $160 / 2 = $80

**3. Calculate the amount of money Ali has remaining after giving to his sister.**

*  Amount remaining: $160 - $80 = $80

**4. Calculate how much Ali spends on dinner.**

*  3/5 of  $80: ($80 * 3/5) = $48

**5. Calculate the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner.**

*  Amount after dinner: $80 - $48 = $32


{The Final Answer is} $32  
<end_of_turn><eos>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40
The six $20 bills also are worth 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
Ali has $40+$120 = $<<40+120=160>>160
When he gives his sister half of the money, he remains with the other half, which totals 1/2*$160 = $<<1/2*160=80>>80
He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32

                    Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob , to shingle a house. If Rob takes 2 hours, how many . minutes does Royce take?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let `x` represent the number of minutes it takes Rob to shingle the house. 
2. **Set up the Equation:**
   * Royce takes 40 minutes *more* than double Rob's time.
   * This can be written as an equation: `x + 40 = 2 * (2x)`
3. **Solve for x:** 
   *  Simplify the equation: `x + 40 = 4x`
   * Subtract `x` from both sides of the equation: `40 = 3x`
   * Divide both sides by `3`: `x = 13.33` (rounded to two decimal places)
4. **Find Royce's Time:**
   *  Royce takes 2 times Rob's time plus 40 minutes. 
   *  `2 * (13.33) + 40 = 26.66 + 40 = 66.66` minutes

                    Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. ? A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if she divides the bag of raisins equally among the cookies, granola, and snack mix?<end_of_turn>
*Note: This problem requires a rational number for the number of batches*


Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify information:**
    - Heather has 27 cups of raisins.
    - Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins.

2. **Define the operation to solve:**
    - We need to figure out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make with the given raisins.
    

3. **Solve using proportion:**
    - Set up a proportion based on the amount of raisins per batch and the total amount of raisins. 
    -  Let 'x' be the number of batches of cookies Heather can make.
    
    - Proportion: (3/4 cup) / (27 cups) = (x batches) / (Total batches)

4. **Simplify the Proportion and solve:**
    - Since the proportion is based on the amount of raisins in each batch, the numerator must also be represented as a proportion of the total amount.
    - Simplify the proportion.


5. **Final answer:** 
    -  {The final answer is 3 batches}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.
Thus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

                    question:
                    Ada's daily electric consumption ! is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add , a device that will consume ? 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before . and after she adds the new device?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Calculate Ada's daily electric consumption with the new device:**
    * Ada's current consumption: 12 kilowatts per hour
    * New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
    * Total daily consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour

2. **Calculate the weekly electric bill before the new device:**
    * Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days/week = 98 kilowatts per week

3. **Calculate the weekly electric bill after the new device:**
    * Weekly consumption: 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days/week = 98 kilowatts per week


4. **Calculate the amount Ada will now spend on electric bill after adding the new device:**
    * Weekly cost: 98 kilowatts/week * $1.50/kilowatt per hour = $147.00


5. **Calculate the difference between the weekly bills before and after adding the new device:**
   * Difference = $147.00 - $147.00 = $0.00

     
**The final answer is: $0.00** 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                    question:
                    If one person can ? paint . half a house in 5 . days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break it down:

**1.  Establish the Individual Rate:**

*   **One Person's Rate:** Let's say one person can paint  1/5 of a house in one day. 

**2.  Calculate the Combined Work Rate:**

*   **Daily Output:**  With one person painting 1/5 of a house in a day, that means they finish 1/5 of the house every day. 
*   **Combined Effort:** With 5 people working, they'd paint 5/5 = 1 house in a day.

**3. Determine the Total Time:**

*   **House Completion:** The whole house will take 5 days.

**4. Calculate the Hours Needed:**

*   **Total Work in Hours** This means in 5 days, they will complete the paint job. Each day they complete the whole house in a day, so in 5 days they complete the job.


{The final answer is 5 days}


<end_of_turn><eos>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.

{The final answer is}


**Solution:**

1. **Define the variables:**
    * Let 'c' represent the number of chairs.
    * Let 's' represent the number of sofas. 

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * We know that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs: s = c - 2
    * Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia: c = 3s

3. **Solve for the number of chairs (c) using the second equation:**
    * Substitute the value of 'c' from the second equation into the first equation: s = 3(3s) - 2 
    * Simplifying: s = 9s - 2
    * Subtract 's' from both sides: 0 = 8s - 2
    * Add 2 to both sides: 2 = 8s
    * Divide both sides by 8: s = 0.25
   
4. ** Substitute the value of 's' into the equations to find the number of chairs (c):**
    * We know from the first equation: 0.25 = c - 2
   * Add 2 to both sides: 2.25 = c 

   


5. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   * s = 20 (Given)
   * c = 2.25 (calculated)

6. **Finally, combine the values for sofas and chairs:**
   * Total sofas: 20
   * Total Chairs: 2.25 
   

**The final answer is ** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought.

**Step 2: Formulate an Equation:**

* The cost of the CDs is given by the price of a single CD multiplied by the number of CDs:  4x 
* The total cost of the purchases is given by the total cost minus the cost of the CDs:  48 - 4x

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation:**

We know that Tom's total cost of the headphones and CDs is $48.

 4x + 4 = 48

**Step 4: Solve for x:**

* Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 44
* Divide both sides by 4: x = 11

**Step 5: Answer the Question:**

In the scenario where Tom does not buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy {11} additional CDs.

{The final answer is }


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1.  Find Jame's current age.**

*  Jame turns 27 in 5 years, so he is currently 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

**2. Determine his cousin's age in 8 years**

* Twice his age in 8 years will be 22 * 2 = 44 years old
* His cousin will be 44 - 5 = 39 years old in 8 years.

 **3. Find the cousin's age now**

*  His age in 8 years is 39, which means his age now is 39 - 8 = 31 years old


**4. Determine the difference in age**

* The difference between their current ages is 31 - 22 = 9

 
**Therefore, the final answer is 9** .

**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Find the price of the printer:**
   * The computer cost $1,100.
   * The printer cost $400 less than the computer, so the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

2. **Determine the combined cost of the computer and printer:** 
   * The computer and printer cost a total of $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. 

3. **Calculate the cost of the two monitors:**
   * He spent $2,400 total and $1,800 on the computer and printer, leaving $2,400 - $1,800 = $600 for the monitors.
   *  He paid for two monitors, so we divide the remaining money to find the cost per monitor: $600 / 2 = $300.

4. **Answer:** Each monitor cost $300.

                    My wife wants , to evenly split the check but wants me to pay an additional 20% tip on our $50 dinner . bill. How much ? did I end up paying?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tip.**

* Multiply the original bill by the percentage for the tip: $50 * 0.20 = $10

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the bill with the tip.**

* Add the tip amount to the original bill: $50 + $10 = $60


**Step 3:  Determine the final cost.**

* Multiply the total cost by the percentage of the final cost.  


{The final answer is $60}<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35

After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he , had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Find the initial share:**

* The problem states that $18 is shared among 3 boys.
* This means each boy started with $18/3 = $6. 

**2.  The eldest's starting amount:**

* His starting share was $6.
* He added $5 in the first instance. 
* Adding $5 to his original amount, his starting share is now $6 + $5 = $11

**3.  The eldest's additional amount:**

* He then added another $10 on day two,  bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21

**4.  The eldest's spending:**

*  The problem states he spent $8. 
* This means he now has $21 - $8 = $13

**5.  The eldest's saving increase:**

* The problem says the eldest ""later needed some money and spent $8""
* This means we need to determine his savings after spending.



Let me know if you would like me to continue walking through the calculation of his savings or any further steps. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.
The eldest had $5+$6=$<<5+6=11>>11 after adding $5 to his share.
He added another $10 so he had $11+$10=$<<11+10=21>>21.
Then he had $21-$8=$<<21-8=13>>13 after spending $8.
So, he now has $13*3=$<<13*3=39>>39.

* *

**Step 1: Define variables**
Let's say,
 *  'x' is the amount Elvis saves in the first half of the month.

**Step 2: Define the goal**
Elvis needs to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half. 
So, the amount he saves in the second half should be 2x.

**Step 3: Set up the equation**
 We know Elvis wants to save a total of $1125 in the month.
 The total saving for the first half is x.
 The total saving for the second half is 2x.
  Therefore, x+2x = 1125. 

**Step 4: Solve for x**
Combining like terms:
 3x = 1125
Dividing both sides by 3:
x = 375

**Step 5: Calculate the saving in the second half**
The amount Elvis saves in the second half is 2x
 Therefore, 2x = 2 * 375 = 750. 



{The final answer is $750}<end_of_turn><eos>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

2. **Calculate the cost of the oranges:**
    * 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

3. **Calculate the cost of the peaches:**

4. **Calculate the total cost of all the fruits:**
    * $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

5. **Calculate the change:**
    * $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00


 {The final answer is $7.00}

**Solution**

*Step 1: Identify the given information* 
We are given that:
* Jairus gets $0.8 per task.
* Jenny gets $0.5 per task.
* They finished 20 tasks.

*Step 2: Define the unknowns*
Let:

Here's the breakdown of Elise's writing journey:

**Step 1: Counting the '!'** 

* Elise writes ! it in full twice, so she writes 2 * 1 = 2 letters

**Step 2: Counting the '.'**

* Elise writes . half of it once so she writes 1 * 1 = 1 letter.

2. **Set up the equation:**
    - Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months, so his total weight loss was 3 * 10 = 30 pounds.
    - Since his final weight was 70 pounds, his initial weight was  x + 30 pounds.

3. **Form the equation:**
    x + 30 = 70 

4. **Solve for x:**
    - Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:

Here's how to break down the problem:

**Step 1: Define the Problem**

We need to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has. We know:

* James's play set has 80 toys.
* He needs 5 times that amount (5 * 80 = 400) toys for his new play set.

**Step 2:  Focus on the Key Information**

The problem provides us with the following information:

* He needs 400 toys in total.
 
**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Toys**


* Jonathan needs 400 toys in total.

* Therefore, Jonathan had to acquire 400 toys to have enough for his new play set.

Calculate the amount of ? money Antonella earned if she . sold goods worth $2500.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can calculate Antonella's earnings step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the first $1000 sale.**

* Commission = 30% of $1000 
* Commission = (30/100) * $1000
* Commission = $300

**Step 2: Calculate the commission from the remaining $1500.**  

*  Commission = 10% of $1500
* Commission = (10/100) * $1500
* Commission = $150 

**Step 3: Calculate the total commission.**

* Total commission = Commission from the first $1000 + Commission from the remaining $1500
* Total commission = $300 + $150
* Total commission= $450

**Step 4: State the final answer!** 
The final answer is $450


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

**Step 2: Use the number of guests and the number of bottles per guest to compute the number of bottles needed.**


*  Bill needs 2 bottles of water per guest
*  Total guests: 70
 
*   Total bottles needed: 2 bottles/guest * 70 guests = 140 bottles 


**Step 3: Determine the number of additional bottles that Bill needs to buy.**

*   Total bottles needed: 140 bottles
*   Total bottles from the cases: 48 bottles
 
*   Additional bottles needed: 140 bottles - 48 bottles = 92 bottles {The final answer is} 92 bottles

Here is the solution:

**Step 1: Define the variables**

*  Let 'x' represent the time Ray takes to swim a mile in warm water. 
*  He swims a mile in warm water in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day.

**Step 2: Set up an equation**

*  Time on a cold day: 16 minutes
*  Time on a warm day: x minutes.
*  Twice the time on a cold day: 2 * 16 minutes = 32 minutes

*  Therefore, the time on the warm day is:  x = 32 + 2 minutes
 

**Step 3: Calculate Ray's time to swim 3 miles on a hot day**

* Let's calculate the time for 3 miles
* Time for 3 miles on a cold day: 16 minutes * 3 = 48 minutes




**Step 4: Calculate Ray's time to swim 3 miles on a hot day**

* Time for 3 miles on a warm day: 
* Time for 3 miles on a cold day:  48 minutes




**Step 5: Find the time difference**


* Time difference:  48 minutes - 32 minutes = 16 minutes



**The final answer is:** Ray takes 16 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the different types of buttons:**
   - We know there are two types of buttons: those with two holes and those with four holes.

2. **Calculate the number of buttons with two holes:**
   - The question states there are 7 buttons with two holes.

3. **Calculate the number of buttons with four holes:**
   -  The total number of buttons is 21, and we know there are 7 buttons with two holes. Therefore, the number of buttons with four holes is 21 - 7 = 14 buttons.

4. **Determine the total number of holes for buttons with two holes:**
   - Buttons with two holes have 2 holes each.  So there are 7 buttons * 2 holes/button = 14 holes. 

5. **Determine the total number of holes for buttons with four holes:**
    - Buttons with four holes have 4 holes each. So there are 14 buttons * 4 holes/button = 56 holes.

6. **Calculate the total number of holes:** 
    - The total number of holes in all the buttons is 14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes.


{The final answer is 70} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}

**Step 1:** Determine how much coffee Octavia drinks. 
* Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount of coffee. 
* This amount is 1/2 of the recommended amount.  

**Step 2:** Calculate how much coffee Juan drinks.
* Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks.
* Therefore, Juan drinks 10 * (1/2) = 5 cups of coffee. 

**Step 3:** Determine the reduction amount.
* Juan's doctor wants him to reduce his intake to 4 cups.
* The difference is  4 - 5 = -1 
* Since we have a negative value, this means Juan needs to reduce his intake by 1 cup


{The final answer is} **Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 1 cup**. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups

Here's how we can determine the cost of Michael's carpet replacement:

**1. Calculate the area of the bedroom:**

* Area = Length × Width
* Area = 18 feet × 12 feet 
* Area = 216 square feet

**2. Calculate the cost of the carpet itself:**

* Cost of carpet = Area × Price per square foot
* Cost of carpet = 216 square feet × $12/square foot
* Cost of carpet = $2592 

**3. Calculate the cost of the padding:**

* Cost of padding = Area × Price per square foot for padding
* Cost of padding = 216 square feet × $2/square foot
* Cost of padding = $432

**4. Calculate the total cost of removal & installation:**

* Cost of removal = Area × Cost per square foot for removal
* Cost of removal = 216 square feet × $4/square foot 
* Cost of removal = $864

*Cost of installation = Area × Cost per square foot for installation
* Cost of installation = 216 square feet × $34/square foot
* Cost of installation = $7344

**5. Calculate the overall cost:**
* Total cost = Cost of carpet + Cost of padding + Cost of removal + Cost of installation
* Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7344 
* Total cost = $11,032

  
**{The final answer is $11,032}**

Step 1: Set up an equation.
Step 2: Substitute in the starting value.
Step 3: Solve the equation for the final value.


Okay, here's how we approach this:

**Step 1: Set up an equation**

Let's use a variable, ""x"", to represent the final value of the number train.  We can formulate an equation reflecting the problem's steps:

x = ( (x/2) + 20 ) / 5 * (20 - 12)

**Step 2: Substitute in the starting value**

We are given, the starting value is 20.

x = ( (x/2) + 20 ) / 5 * (20 - 12)

x = ( (x/2) + 20 ) / 5 * 8

**Step 3: Solve for x**

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 5: 
    5x = (x/2) + 20 * 8

* Simplify the multiplication on the right side: 
    5x = (x/2) + 160 

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 2:  
   10x = x + 320

* Subtract x from both sides:  
    9x = 320

* Finally, divide both sides by 9:
    x = 320 / 9 

**The final answer is**: {x = 35.56}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the Percentage Error:** 
    *  Find the difference between the actual temperature and the set temperature. 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.
    *  Calculate the rate at which the oven is off by dividing error by actual temperature: 18 / 450 = 0.04
2. **Apply the Percentage Error to the desired recipe:**
    *  Multiply the percentage error by the desired recipe's temperature.  0.04 x 520 = 20.8 degrees
3. **Calculate the Corrected Temperature:**
    *  Add the calculated amount to the original desired recipe temperature. 520 + 20.8 = 540.8 degrees


**Final Answer:** Maggie should set the oven to 540.8 degrees.

{The final answer is}


## Solution
**Step 1: Find the price of Juan's house.**

* Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's.
* This means Juan's house is 100% - 30% = 70% of Herb's price.

**Step 2: Calculate the price of Juan's house.**

* Multiply Herb's house price by 70% : $76,000 * 0.70 = $53,200 
 
**Step 3: Calculate the combined value of the two houses.**

* Add the price of Juan's house and Herb's house: $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200


{The final answer is} $129,200. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Determine the number of dishes.**

* Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 12 cups * 2 = 24 dishes. 

**Step 2: Calculate the number of dishes brought by the friend.**

* The friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so she brought 24 dishes + 20 dishes = 44 dishes.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cups.**

* Judy brought 12 cups.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of dishes.**

* Judy brought 24 dishes, and her friend brought 44 dishes, so the total number of dishes is 24 + 44 = 68 dishes.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of utensils.**

* Finally, Judy brought 12 cups, and her friend brought 44 dishes, so the total number of utensils is 12 + 68 = 80 utensils.

 
{The final answer is 80} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.
Judy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24
All the utensils brought by Judy is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36
Her friend brought 24+ 20 = <<24+20=44>>44 dishes.
The total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend is 44 dishes+40 cups = <<44+40=84>>84
When they combined their utensils, they brought together 84+36 = <<84+36=120>>120

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the discount per box:**

* Discount amount: 10% of $100.00 = $10.00

**2. Calculate the price of one box after the discount:**

* Discounted price: $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box

**3. Determine the number of contact pairs per box:**

* 90 single-use contacts/box 

**4. Calculate the cost of each box of contact:**

* The price of one box:  $90.00

 **5. Determine the total cost of two boxes:**

* Price of two boxes: 2 * $90.00 = $180.00


** 6. Calculate the cost per contact pair:**
 
* $180.00 / (90 contacts / box) = $2.00 per contact pair


 {The final answer is $2.00 per contact pair} 

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

*I will use a step-by-step approach to solve this problem.


**Step 1: Calculate total calories burned.** 
* Aerobics: 500 calories/hour * 2 hours = 1000 calories
* Running: 600 calories/hour * 1 hour = 600 calories
* Total calories burned: 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

**Step 2: Determine the amount of water Hannah needs based on calories burned.** 
* She needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs.**
* 1600 calories / 200 calories/ml = 8 ml


**The final answer is: 8 ml. **

If the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, how many more green jelly beans does it contain : than red jelly ! beans?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

Let's use the following variables to represent the number of each jelly bean type:

*  Let  'r' represent the number of red jelly beans.
*  Let 'b' represent the number of blue jelly beans.
*  Let 'g' represent the number of green jelly beans.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Information**

We're given some information about the relationship between the different jelly bean types:

* **Equation 1:** ""This jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans."" 
   * This translates to: b - 0.01r = r     (The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than the number of blue)
* **Equation 2:** ""and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans."" 
   * This translates to: g = b + 0.01g
   
 **Step 3: Combine Equations**

We have two equations that involve the relationships between the different jelly bean types. Now our goal is to figure out a way to solve for the number of green jelly beans compared to red. 


**Step 4: Solve for r and b**

* Combine the equations. We will need a system of equations to find the number of each jelly bean type.
* Work through the steps to find solutions for 'r' and 'b'. 

**Step 5: Figure Out the Difference in Green and Red**


* Once we find the number of red and blue jelly beans (r and b) we can find the difference. 



**Step 6: Final Answer** 

{The final answer is} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans

* Jared's initial typing speed: 47 WPM
* His typing speed after lessons: 52 WPM
*  Increase in typing speed: +5 WPM


**Step 2:** Calculate the total typing speed for the three measurements.
* Total typing speed = (Initial speed) + (Speed after lesson) + (Increase)
* Total typing speed = 47 WPM + 52 WPM + 5 WPM
* Total typing speed = 104 WPM


**Step 3:** Calculate the average typing speed.
* Average Speed = (Total speed) / (Number of speeds)

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Determine the growth rate.**

* The beanstalk doubles its height every day. 
* This means it grows by a factor of 2 each day.

**Step 2: Calculate the height after one day.**

* The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
* After one day, it grows by a factor of 2: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet

**Step 3:  Calculate the height after two days.**

* After two days, the beanstalk is 8 feet tall and grows by a factor of 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet

**Step 4: Calculate the height after three days.** 

*  After three days, the beanstalk is 16 feet tall and grows by a factor of 2: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

**Step 5: Determine when the beanstalk will surpass the window.**

* To find out when the beanstalk will be taller than 20 feet, consider the growth pattern:
    * Day 1 : 4 feet
    * Day 2: 8 feet
    * Day 3: 16 feet
    * Day 4: 32 feet 

**Let me know if you have any other questions. 




**Final answer:**  It will take 4 days. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the daily protein intake per 100 grams:**

*  Divide the protein content by the weight of the mushroom cup: 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushroom. 

**2. Calculate the daily protein intake for 200 grams:**

* Multiply the protein content per gram by the weight of mushrooms eaten per day:  0.03 grams/gram * 200 grams = 6 grams of protein.



**3. Calculate the protein intake per week:** 

* Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week: 6 grams/day * 7 days/week = 42 grams of protein per week
    


**The final answer is: 42 grams of protein per week** .<end_of_turn><eos>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day
So that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day
So he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week

                    question:
                    Jerry is twice as old as : he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'x' be Jerry's current age.
* Five years ago, Jerry was 'x - 5' years old.

**2. Set up an Equation**

The problem tells us, ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.""  We can write this as an equation: 
  * x = 2(x - 5) 

**3. Solve for x (Jerry's Current Age)**

* Expand the right side of the equation: x = 2x - 10
* Subtract 'x' from both sides: 0 = x - 10
* Add 10 to both sides: 10 = x 

**4. Calculate Jerry's Age in 3 Years**

  * In 3 years, Jerry will be 10 + 3 = 13 years old.


**Final Answer:** The final answer is 13.<end_of_turn><eos>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

How many ! hours does he need , to work before he has enough to pay ? for the dental work?<end_of_turn>
  
Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the total cost of each implant with the crown:**

* Base price: $2000
* Porcelain crown: $500
* Total cost per implant: $2000 + $500 = $2500

**2. Determine the remaining cost after the deposit:**

* Total cost per implant: $2500
* Deposit: $600
* Remaining cost: $2500 - $600 = $1900

**3. Calculate the number of hours needed to work:**

* Hourly rate: $15/hour
* Remaining cost: $1900
* Number of hours needed: $1900 / $15/hour = 126.67 hours


**Final Answer: He needs to work approximately 127 hours to pay for the dental work. 



**Additional Notes:**

* This solution is rounded up to the nearest whole hour since hours need to be whole numbers for practical payroll reasons.
 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the measure of the smallest angle.
   
2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    * The three angles add up to 180 degrees:  x + 2x + 3x = 180
    * Simplify the equation: 6x = 180

3. **Solve for the smallest angle:**
    * Divide both sides of the equation by 6:  x = 30 degrees

4. **Find the measure of the larger angles:**
    * The larger angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's 2 * 30 degrees = 60 degrees
    * The larger angle is also three times the smallest angle, so it's 3 * 30 degrees = 90 degrees.

5. **Identify the largest angle:**
       * The largest angle is 90 degrees.

{The final answer is 90 degrees.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the total value of the quarters:**

*  Each quarter is worth $0.25.
*  Total value of quarters = 8 quarters * $0.25/quarter = $2

**2. Calculate the total value of the dimes:**

*   Each dime is worth $0.10.
*  Total value of dimes = 6 dimes * $0.10/dime = $0.60

**3. Calculate the total value of the nickels:**

*  Each nickel is worth $0.05.
*  Total value of nickels = 14 nickels * $0.05/nickel = $0.70

**4. Calculate the total value of the pennies:** 

*  Each penny is worth $0.01.
*  Total value of pennies = 15 pennies * $0.01/penny = $0.15

**5. Calculate the total money Colby has:**

* Total money = $2 + $0.60 + $0.70 + $0.15 = $3.45

**6. Determine how many gumballs he can buy:**

*  Each gumball costs $0.05
*  Number of gumballs = Total money / Cost per gumball 
*  Number of gumballs = $3.45 / $0.05 = 69

 {The final answer is 69}




<end_of_turn><eos>","He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.
He has $.6 in dimes because 6 times .1 equals <<6*.1=.6>>.6
He has $.7 in nickels because 14 times .05 equals .7
He has $.15 in pennies because 15 times .01 equals <<15*.01=.15>>.15
He has $3.65 because 2 plus .6 plus .7 plus .15 equals $<<2+.6+.7+.15=3.45>>3.45
He can buy 69 gum balls because 3.65 divided by .05 equals 69

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate earnings from the first four hours**

*  Cost per hour: $0.50 
*  Lemonade quantity: 15 cups/hour
*  Earnings for the first four hours: $0.50/cup * 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = $30

**2. Calculate earnings from the next two hours**

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the total number of rotations per month:**

* Miles driven per month: 400 miles
* Tires rotation per mile: 725 rotations
* Total monthly rotations: 400 miles * 725 rotations/mile = 290,000 rotations

**2. Calculate the total number of years of driving:**

* Total rotations: 290,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 3,480,000 rotations/year 
* Number of years: 3,480,000 rotations / 10,440,000 rotations/tire = 0.34 years


**3. Convert the years to months:**

* 0.34 years * 12 months/year = 4.08 months

**Therefore, the tire could last approximately 4.08 months. 
{The final answer is 4.08 months} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

He also picks out a pair of shorts for $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, how much ! money will Joe have left after the ? purchase?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}


Here's how to solve this:

**1. Calculate the discount:**

*  Multiply the original price of the shirt by the discount percentage: $25 * 0.30 = $7.50

**2.  Calculate the price of the shirt after the discount:**

*  Subtract the discount from the original price: $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

**3. Calculate the total cost of the outfit:**

*  Add the price of the shirt to the price of the shorts: $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

**4. Calculate how much money Joe will have left:**

* Subtract the total cost from his starting amount: $50 - $52.50 = -$2.50


**The final answer is**: Joe will have $2.50 left after purchasing the outfit. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.
The total sale discount comes to 60 * 0.3 = <<60*0.3=18>>18 dollars.
The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate total croissants**

* Juan is making 4 dozen croissants per day * 7 days = 28 dozen croissants.

**Step 2: Determine the total pound of butter needed**

* He needs 28 dozen croissants * (1/4 pound/dozen) = 7 pounds of butter.


**The final answer is 7 pounds of butter. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter
He wants to add 4 dozen croissants a day to the menu for a total of 7 days so he needs 1*7 = 7 pounds of butter

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Determine the cost of repaving Monica's street.**

*  Multiply the street length by the cost per meter.
*  = 150 meters * $194/meter
*  = $29,100

**2. Determine the cost of repaving Lewis's street.** 

* Multiply the street length by the cost per meter.
*  = 490 meters * $194/meter
*  = $93,460

**3. Calculate the difference in cost.**

* Subtract the cost to repave Monica's street from the cost to repave Lewis's street.
*  = $93,460 - $29,100
*  = $64,360


{The final answer is $64,360}

He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  , His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can approach this problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the funding for the first 5 months:**

* He receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

**2. Calculate the funding increase per month:**

*  A 50% increase means the funding increases by 50/100 * $100,000 = $50,000 each month

**3. Calculate the funding for each subsequent month:**

*  Funding after the first 5 months is calculated by adding the 50% increase to the previous month's funding. 
* This gets repeated every month.

 **4. Define the number of months:**

*  John's research takes 10 times the initial 5 months.


Let's break it down further:

* **Month 6:** $100,000 + ($50,000) = $150,000
* **Month 7:** $150,000 + ($50,000) = $200,000
* **Month 8:** $200,000 + ($50,000) = $250,000
* **Month 9:** $250,000 + ($50,000) = $300,000
* **Month 10:** $300,000 + ($50,000) = $350,000
* **Month 11:** $350,000 + ($50,000) = $400,000 
* **And so on**


**5. Calculate the total financial cost:**

 *  We need to add the cost of each month for all the months.




{The final answer is $1,400,000}



**Important note:**  You could also use a spreadsheet or a formula to calculate the cumulative monthly funding, making your calculation faster and more precise. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months
So he paid for expensive research for 50-5=<<50-5=45>>45 months
Each month of research at the cheaper stage cost 100,000/5=$<<100000/5=20000>>20,000
So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000
So the total cost was 1,350,000+100,000=$<<1350000+100000=1450000>>1,450,000

* The first player's steak is 6 ounces.
* The second player's beef tips are 8 tips * 1 ounce/tip = 8 ounces
* The third player's steak is 1 pound * 16 ounces/pound = 16 ounces.

**2. Calculate the total meat ounces:**

* The first player consumed 6 ounces.
* The second player consumed 8 ounces.
* The third player consumed 16 ounces.
* Therefore, the total meat ounces consumed are 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces

**3.  Determine the meat consumed by the teams.**

The steakhouse team consumed 30 ounces of meat.



**The final answer is 30 ounces**<end_of_turn><eos>","The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.

*  He chews 1 piece on the way home + 1 piece after dinner = 2 pieces of gum.

**4. Gum given to his sister:**

*  He gives half the gum remaining at the end of the day to his sister.
*  This means he gives away (1 / 2) * 20 gum = 10 gum 
 


**5. Total gum chewed throughout the day**

*  Gum chewed at school + Gum chewed on the way home + Gum chewed after dinner = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum 

**6. Gum Jim has left:**


*  He started with 20 pieces
*  He gives away 10
*  Therefore, he has 20 - 10 = 10 pieces left.


{The final answer is 10}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

                    Charmaine will be 16 years ? old in 12 years. How : old will she be 4 years from now?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Determine Charmaine's current age.**

* We know she will be 16 years old in 12 years.
*  This means her current age is 16 - 12 = 4 years younger than 16. 

**Step 2: Calculate her current age.**

* Since she will be 16 in 12 years, her current age is 16 - 12 = 4 years old.

**Step 3: Determine her age 4 years from now.** 

* Her current age is 4, so in 4 years she will be 4 + 4 = 8 years old. 


{The final answer is 8} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Charmaine's present age is 16 - 12 = <<16-12=4>>4 years old.
So she will be 4 + 4 = <<4+4=8>>8 years old 4 years from now.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the baseballs:**
   - Cost of baseballs = 9 baseballs * $3/baseball 
   - Cost of baseballs = $27 

2. **Calculate the cost of the basketballs:**
   - Cost of basketballs = 8 basketballs * $14/basketball
   - Cost of basketballs = $112

3. **Find the difference in costs:**
   - Difference = Cost of basketballs - Cost of baseballs
   - Difference = $112 - $27 

4. **Determine the amount the basketball coach spent more:**
   - The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.


{The final answer is $85} 

<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the baseballs is 9 × $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.
The cost of the basketballs is 8 × $14 = $<<8*14=112>>112.
Basketballs cost $112 − $27 = $85 more.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define the Units**

* Ashley's connection speed is given in kb/sec (kilobits per second).
* We need to express this in Mb/hr (megabytes per hour).

**2. Find the Conversion Factor**

* We know 1 Mb = 1000 kb
* This means we need to convert kb/sec to Mb/sec

**3. Calculate the Speed in Mb/sec**

* 20 kb/sec * (1 Mb / 1000 kb) = 0.02 Mb/sec

**4. Convert to Mb/hour**

*  We need to multiply this by 3600 seconds in an hour. 


{The final answer is 0.02 Mb/hour} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.
As 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.
So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Cars towed on the first three days:**

* The tow truck pulls 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars. 

**2. Cars towed on the remaining days:**

*  There are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining days.
*  The tow truck pulls 10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 fewer cars per day
*  Total cars towed for the remaining days: 6 fewer cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars

**3. Total cars towed:**

*  30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars

 {The final answer is 54 cars.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

Here's the solution:

**Step 1: Convert everything to the same unit.** 

* We need to convert Adam's height from inches to feet. 
*  There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so Adam's height in feet is 40 inches / 12 inches/foot = 3.33 feet.

**Step 2:  Calculate how much taller Adam will get.**

* His height increases by 2 inches every year, so he becomes taller by 2 inches/year.


**Step 3: Determine the number of years to reach the desired height.**


* We know Adam is currently 3.33 feet tall and needs to be 4 feet tall.
* We calculated he will grow 2 inches each year.


{The final answer is 1 year.}

**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

**1. Calculate the total cost of the cars:**

* Cost per car: $25,000
* Number of cars: 10
* Total cost: $25,000 * 10 = $250,000

**2. Calculate the acquisition cost:**

*  Acquisition cost: 0.30 * $250,000 = $75,000

**3. Calculate the net profit per car:**

*  Total cost of the cars: $250,000
*  Acquisition Cost: $75,000
*  Net profit per car: $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000

Here's the breakdown of the solve:

**Step 1: Find the price of the gold Jewell.**

*  We know the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.
*  The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of a diamond Jewell.
*  Therefore, the price of a gold Jewell is (4/5) * $2000 = $1600.

**Step 2: Find the price of the silver Jewell.**

* The price of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.

*This step has already been done in Step 1, we know the price of gold Jewell is $1600.


**Step 4: Find the total price of all three jewels.**

* The total price of all three jewels is the sum of their individual prices: $1600 (gold) + $1200 (silver) + $2000 (diamond)

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Determine the rate of Bob's movement:** 
* Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom and Tom is travelling at 70 mph.


**2. Calculate the difference in speed:**
* Bob's speed - Tom's speed = Rate of speed between them.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.




{The final answer is $12.00}<end_of_turn><eos>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

                    question:
                    Bob wants to dig a hole 6 ? feet long by 4 feet : wide by 3 feet deep. If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, how long will it take him to dig the hole?<end_of_turn>
*I need help understanding this problem.*


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* **Shape:** Bob wants to dig a rectangular hole (a simple shape for this calculation)
* **Dimensions:** The specific measurements of the hole are 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.
* **Task:**  We need to figure out how long it will take him to dig it, considering he shovels a cubic foot in 3 seconds

**2. Calculating Volume**

* **Formula:**  The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the hole) is length x width x depth
* **Calculation:**  Volume = 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet


**3.  Finding Digging Time**

* **Unit:** We know he digs 1 cubic foot every 3 seconds.
* **Total Time:** We need to see how many cubic feet he must dig to complete the hole.
    * Total Time = Volume / dig rate
    * Total time = 72 cubic feet / 3 cubic feet/second  = 24 seconds



**The final answer is:** It will take Bob 24 seconds to dig the hole. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.
Bob shovels a cubic foot of earth every 3 seconds so it will take 72 * 3 = <<72*3=216>>216 seconds to dig the hole.

* Step 1:  Calculate the cost of the leather seats.

* Step 2: Calculate the cost of the running boards.

* Step 3: Calculate the cost of the upgraded exterior light package.

* Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the base price plus the extra features.




**Solution**

* Step 1: Calculate the cost of the leather seats. 

*   The leather seats cost one-third the price of the king cab, which is $7,500.
*   Therefore, the cost of the leather seats is (1/3) * $7,500 = $2,500.


* Step 2: Calculate the cost of the running boards.

*   The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

* Step 3: Calculate the cost of the upgraded exterior light package.

*   The cost of the package is $1,500.

* Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the base price plus the extra features. 

*   The total cost is ($30,000) + ($7,500) + ($2,500) + ($2,000) + ($1,500) = $44,500.

{The final answer is $44,500}

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the raise:**
   * His raise is 5% of his salary, so multiply his salary by 5% = $20000 * 0.05 = $1000

**2. Calculate his new salary:**
   * Add his raise to his original salary: $20000 + $1000 = $21000

**3. Calculate his bonus:**
  * His bonus is half his salary, so  $21000 / 2 = $10500.

**4. Calculate his total annual salary:** 
  *  Add his new salary and his bonus together: $21000 + $10500 = $31500


**The final answer is $31500** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000
So his new salary is 20000+1000=$<<20000+1000=21000>>21000 a month
So he makes 21000*12=$<<21000*12=252000>>252,000 a year
The bonus is worth 21000*.5=$<<21000*.5=10500>>10500
So he makes 252,000+10,500=$<<252000+10500=262500>>262,500 for the year

*Think about how you'd handle this problem.* 

Here's how I would approach this:

1. **Understand the problem:**  The problem asks us to find the total amount of flour in three separate bags before they were divided. 
2. **Initial Information:** We know that one bag has 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, suggesting a total of (8 portions * 2 kg/portion) = 16 kg of flour.
3. **Determine total flour in three bags:** Hence, three bags would have a total of (16 kg/bag)*3 bags = 48 kg of flour. {The final answer is 48 kg. }



Let me know if you have any other questions. <end_of_turn><eos>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Determine the digging speed for clay:** 
   - Bill digs half as fast in clay as he does in soil.
   - Speed in clay = 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour

**2. Calculate the digging time for the soil:**
   - Time = Total Distance / Speed.
   - Time (soil) = 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

**3. Calculate the digging time for the clay:**
   - Time (clay) = 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

**4. Calculate the total digging time:**
   - Total Time = Time (soil) + Time (clay) 
   - Total Time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours


**The final answer is 10 hours.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour

Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. . Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Find the sales from green hats.**

* Ariadne's red hat sales were half her green hat sales, meaning red hat sales represent her green hat sales divided by 2.
* This can be represented by the equation: Red hat sales = 1/2 of Green hat sales.

**Step 2:  Calculate the green hat sales.**

* We know red hat sales are $400. 
* Since red hat sales represent 1/2 of green hat sales, we have the equation: $400 = 1/2 * Green hat sales.

**Step 3: Solve for green hat sales.**

* To solve for Green hat sales, multiply both sides of the equation by 2: $400 * 2 = 1/2 * Green hat sales * 2
* This simplifies to: $800 = Green hat sales

**Step 4: Calculate the total sales for the first month.**

*  Ariadne's total sales from green hats are $800. 

**Step 5: Calculate the sales from red hats for the first month.**

*  We already know this is $400.

**Step 6: Calculate the sales from green hats for the second month.**

*  Ariadne's total sales from green hats are $800, and the sales are 3/4 of the first month's sales.

**Step 7: Calculate the second month sales.**

*   Using the information from step 6, we can calculate 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. 
*   This is represented by the equation: Second Month Sales = 3/4 * First Month Sales.


{The final answer is}<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.
Her total sales in the first month are $800+$400=$<<800+400=1200>>1200.
In the second month, she made 3/4*1200=$<<3/4*1200=900>>900.
The total amount of money Ariadne made from two months of sales is $1200+$900=$<<1200+900=2100>>2100.

4. **Calculate the cost of the paid hours:** Since each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour, we know that after the first hour, each hour is $15 * 2 = $30. 

5. **Calculate the total cost:**  
    * Cost of the first hour: $15
    * Cost of every hour after first hour: $30
    * Total cost: $15 + ($30 * 3) = $15 + $90 = $105 




{The final answer is $105}<end_of_turn><eos>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:**

* Lori's guests will eat 3 egg halves apiece.
* Total egg halves needed: 16 guests * 3 egg halves/guest = 48 egg halves

**2. Determine how many whole eggs are needed:**

* Each egg makes 1/2 of a whole egg.
* Total egg halves needed: 48
* Total whole eggs needed: 48 egg halves * 2 egg halves/whole egg = 96 egg halves

**3. Determine how many dozens of eggs are needed:**

* Each dozen contains 12 eggs.
* Total egg halves needed: 96
* Dozens of eggs needed: 96 egg halves / 12 eggs/dozen = 8 dozens


{The final answer is 8 dozens} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step to find the solution:

**1. Calculate fuel cost:**

* James spends twice as much on fuel as rent, so he spends 2 * $5000 = $10,000 per month on fuel.
*  He spends this on fuel per month so over a year this is $10,000/month * 12 months = $120,000

**2. Calculate total annual cost:**

* Total cost for plane and hangar is $150,000 + $5000 = $155,000
*  Add fuel costs to that: $155,000 + $120,000 = $275,000

{The final answer is $275,000}


<end_of_turn><eos>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate pork cooking time:**

* Finley spent 20 more minutes cooking pork than rice. 
* Pork cooking time = Rice cooking time + 20 minutes 
* Pork cooking time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

**2. Calculate beans cooking time:**

* Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
* Beans cooking time = (Pork cooking time + Rice cooking time) / 2
* Beans cooking time = (50 minutes + 30 minutes) / 2 = 40 minutes

**3. Calculate the total cooking time:**

* Total cooking time = Rice cooking time + Pork cooking time + Beans cooking time
* Total cooking time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 120 minutes

 
**The final answer is 120 minutes.**

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

**1. Calculate the cost of the mixtures:**

* **Mixture 1:** (1/2 lb) almonds + (1/3 lb) walnuts
   *  Cost of almonds: (1/2 lb) * $10/lb = $5
   *  Cost of walnuts: (1/3 lb) * $15/lb = $5 
   *  Total cost of Mixture 1:  $5 + $5 = $10

* **Mixture 2:** (1/5 lb) almonds + (1/3 lb) walnuts
   * Cost of almonds: (1/5 lb) * $10/lb = $2
   * Cost of walnuts: (1/3 lb) * $15/lb = $5
   * Total cost of Mixture 2: $2 + $5 = $7

**2. Find the difference in costs:**

* Cost difference: $10 (Mixture 1) - $7 (Mixture 2) = $3

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let  's' be the number of sheep.
* Let 'g' be the number of geese.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on given information**

*  **Equation 1 (Legs):**  2s + 2g = 70 (Each sheep and goose has two legs)
*  **Equation 2 (Heads):** s + g = 20 (Each sheep and goose has one head)

**Step 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other**

* Solve Equation 2 for 's': 
     s = 20 - g

**Step 4: Substitute the expression into the other equation**

* Substitute (20 - g) for 's' into Equation 1:
    2(20 - g) + 2g = 70

**Step 5: Solve for the remaining variable**

* Simplify and rearrange the equation: 
    40 - 2g + 2g = 70
    40 = 70  
 
**Step 6: Analyze the result**

* The equation 40 = 70 is not possible. This means there is no solution that satisfies the given conditions of the problem.

{The final answer is: There is no solution.} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.

2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the price of the more expensive brand:**

* The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand. 
* 20% of $5 is (20/100) * $5 = $1 per pound.
* The price of the more expensive coffee is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

**2. Calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week:**

* He uses 1 pound per day, so for a week he will use 1 pound/day * 7 days = 7 pounds.
* The total cost of the coffee is 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.

**3. Calculate the total cost including the donut:**

* The donut costs $2.
* The total cost of everything is $42 + $2 = $44.

 type A cost $0.5 each
 type B cost $0.75 each


Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the candies of type A:**
* Cost per candy of type A: $0.50
* Number of candies of type A: 7
* Total cost of type A: $0.50 * 7 = $3.50

**2. Calculate the cost of the candies of type B:**
* Cost per candy of type B: $0.75
* Number of candies of type B: 10
* Total cost of type B: $0.75 * 10 = $7.50

**3. Calculate the total cost of all the candies:**
* Total cost of type A: $3.50
* Total cost of type B: $7.50
* Total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00

 **4. Calculate the change Adam received:**
* Amount paid: $15.00
* Total cost: $11.00
* Change: $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00

{The final answer is $4.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

**Solution:**
1. **Convert feet to inches:**
   - 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.  

2. **Determine the number of days to reach the height:**
   - We need to figure out how many days it takes to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches.
   - (600 inches - 240 inches) / 30 inches/day = 360 inches / 30 inches/day

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Initial Number of Dogs**

* James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs, so there were 4 toys initially. 
* So, he had 4 toys in total.

**Step 2: New Number of Dogs**

* There are now 8 more dogs than before the purchase, bringing the total to 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

**Step 3:  Twice the Number of Dogs** 

* After the added dogs, there's twice as many more dogs than before, meaning 12 dogs * 2 = 24 dogs.

**Step 4: Total Toys Needed**

* Each dog needs one toy, so James needs 24 dogs * 1 toy/dog = 24 toys.

**Step 5: Final Number of Toys** 

* James had 4 toys to start, but he had to buy 24 toys.
* Therefore, James needs a total of 4 + 24 = 28 toys.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Dylan's Investment**

* Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, so we know: Dylan's investment = (2/5) * $1200

**Step 2: Amount After Dylan's Investment**

*  After Dylan's investment, the remaining balance is: $1200 - (2/5) * $1200
*  This can be rewritten as:  $1200 - (240/100) * $1200 
* Simplifying: $1200 - $288 = $912

**Step 3: Frances's Investment**

* Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining balance: Frances's investment = (2/3) * $912

**Step 4: Total Investment**

*  We know: Dylan's investment + Frances's investment = Skyler's investment
*  So, we have: (2/5) * $1200 + (2/3) * $912 =  Skyler's investment


**Step 5: Calculate Skyler's Investment**
 
*  Calculate the final value of the investment of Dylan and Frances.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Proportion:**  
   - We know that 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns. This means we are dealing with a ratio.
   -  The ratio is 6 potatoes : 36 hash browns
2. **Introduce a Variable:**
    - Let 'x' be the number of hash browns we can get from 96 potatoes. 
3. **Formulate an Equation:** 
   - We can set up a proportion to solve for 'x': 
     6:36  = 96:x
4. **Solve for 'x':**
   - Cross-multiply: 6 * x = 36 * 96
   - Simplify: 6x = 3456
   - Divide both sides by 6: x = 576

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of . the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**
* Let 'x' represent the original length of the dress.

**2. Set up the Equation:**
* The final length of the dress is 140 cm, and the dress is extended by 50% of its original length, So, the equation will be: 
   x + 0.50x + 20 = 140 

**3. Solve for 'x':**
*Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: 
   1.50x + 20 = 140

* Subtract 20 from both sides:
   1.50x = 120

* Divide both sides by 1.50:
   x = 80

 
**4. Conclusion:**
*  The dress was originally 80 cm long. 



{The final answer is} 80 cm.<end_of_turn><eos>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.
Let's assume the dress was originally x cm in length.
Half the original length is x/2.
Adding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120
3/2x = 120
The orginal length is x= 80 cm

Here's the breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

**1.  Define the Problem:**

* We know John and Jack need to walk to school in 30 minutes. 
* The journey to the library corner takes 6 minutes.
* The journey to the fire station takes 13 minutes. 
* We need to find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late.

**2. Calculate the Total Time:**

* Total time for the library corner and fire station is 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.

**3.  Find the Remaining Time:**

* Total time for journey to the corner and fire station is 19 minutes

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Find out how many cookies Celinda bakes:** 
   - Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, who baked 30 cookies.
   - Celinda's cookies: 30 * 2 = 60 cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies = Total cookies
   - 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

3. **Subtract the cookies they ate:**

Here's a step-by-step solution: 

**1. Define the variables:**

* Let ""t"" represent the age of one of the twins.
* Let ""3t"" represent the age of one of the triplets.

**2. Set up an equation:**

* The problem states that one twin is 7 years older than one of the triplets. This translates to:  t = 3t - 7 

**3.  Use the combined age information:**

* The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: t + 3t = 44

**4. Solve for the age of one of the twins:**

* Combining the equations from steps 2: 4t = 44
* Dividing both sides by 4: t = 11

{The final answer is 11 } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:**

* Cost per lollipop: $0.40
* Number of lollipops: 5
* Total cost of lollipops: $0.40 * 5 = $2.00

**2. Calculate the total cost of the candies:**

**4.  Final Answer** 


{The final answer is $2.00} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

*Note: Please show your steps clearly and clearly indicate the final answer.*

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1.  Determine Neil's savings per month.** 

* Rong saves 20 coins/month.
* Neil saves 2/5 times more, so he saves 2/5 * 20 = 8 coins more per month than Rong.
* Neil's savings per month: 20 + 8 = 28 coins/month.

**2.  Calculate the number of coins Rong saves in 10 years.**

* Rong saves 20 coins/month, so in a year he saves 20 * 12 = 240 coins.
* In 10 years, he saves 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.

**3.  Calculate the number of coins Neil saves in 10 years.**

* Neil saves 28 coins/month, so in a year he saves 28 * 12 = 336 coins.
* In 10 years, he saves 336 * 10 = 3360 coins. 

**4.  Determine the total savings of both Rong and Neil over 10 years.**

 * Total savings: Rong's coins + Neil's coins 
 * Total savings: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins 


{The final answer is 5760 coins} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:** 
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, there are 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs.

2. **Find the total number of chairs needed:**

                    question:
                    Students in class 3B are collecting school points for behavior. If they get enough points in total, they can ! go on a trip. , In the class, there are Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has collected 50 points. Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more. Marta managed to collect 3 times more points : than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty. How many points is the class missing to go on the trip . if the minimum threshold is 400 points?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Betty's points:**
    *  30% of Adam's points is (30/100) * 50 = 15 points
    * Betty's points are Adam's points + 15 points = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

2. **Calculate Marta's points:**
    * Marta collected 3 times more than Tom, so Marta's points are 3 * 30 = 90 points.

3. **Calculate Tom's points:**
    * Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom's points are 65 - 30 = 35 points.

4. **Calculate the total points for the class:**
    * Adam: 50 points
    * Betty: 65 points
    * Marta: 90 points
    * Tom: 35 points
    * Total: 50 + 65 + 90 + 35 = 230 points.


5. **Calculate the points the class is missing:**
    *  The minimum threshold is 400 points
    * The class needs 400 - 230 = 170 more points.



{The final answer is 170} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

And . when Gary brings his truck and joins Gissela and Gordy, ! the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel. How : many pounds of gravel can Gary's truck carry?<end_of_turn>
*steps*
1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'G' represent the number of pounds that Gissela's truck can haul.
   * Let 'O' represent the number of pounds that Gordy's truck can haul. 
   * Let 'G' represent the number of pounds that Gary's truck can haul..

2. **Write down the given information in equations:**
   *  Gissela's truck capacity: G = 4000
   *  Gordy's truck capacity: O = G + 800
   *  Combined capacity: G + O + G = 11600

3. **Solve for G (Gissela's capacity):** 
   * Combine like terms in the third equation: 2G + O = 11600
   * Substitute the value of O: 2G + (G+800) = 11600 
   * Combine like terms: 3G+800 = 11600
   * Subtract 800 from both sides: 3G = 10800
   * Divide both sides by 3: G = 3600

4. **Solve for O (Gordy's capacity):**
    * Substitute the value of G into the equation for O: O = 3600 + 800
    * Calculate: O = 4400 

5. **Solve for G (Gary's capacity):**
    * Substitute the values of G and O into the equation: 3600 + 4400 + G = 11600
    * Combine like terms on the left side: 8000 + G = 11600
    * Subtract 8000 from both sides: G = 3600

6. **Conclusion:**
    * Gissela's truck can haul 4000 pounds
    * Gordy's truck can haul 4400 pounds 
    * Gary's truck can haul 3600 pounds

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Relationship**

* We know that males ate 1 more dumpling than females. 
* We know females ate 3 dumplings. 

**2. Determine the Number of Dumplings Consumed by Males**

* Since one male ate 1 more dumpling than a female, we multiply the number of females' dumplings by 1 to find the number of males' dumplings.
* Males ate 3 dumplings * 1 = 3 dumplings

**3. Calculate Total Dumpling Consumption**

*  The total number of dumplings consumed by males + the total number of dumplings consumed by females
* = 3 dumplings + 3 dumplings = 6 dumplings

**4. Find the Number of Dumplings Cooked by Larry**

* Females ate 3 dumplings * 6 = 18 dumplings. 
* Males ate 3 dumplings * 8 = 24 dumplings

**5. Final Answer** 

{The final answer is 24 dumplings }



<end_of_turn><eos>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio 3:2 means that for every $3 Gerald has, Julia has $2. 

**2.  Find the Proportional Value:**

* We need to find out how much money Gerald has in the ratio. 
 
**3. Calculate the Value of One Proportion:**

*  To find the proportional value in the ratio, we must realize that Gerald received $3 for every portion. We can calculate the value of one proportion.

**4. Find Gerald's Total Portion**

* To find Gerald's total portion of the $100, add both Gerald's portion and the amount Julia received.


**5. Calculate the Remaining Money:**

* Subtract Gerald's spending ($10) from his total amount.


**Let me know if you want to work through any of those steps further!** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.

Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

**1. Understand the relationship:**

* The problem states that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. This means the turtle's speed is one-fifth (1/5) of the cat's speed.

**2. Find the turtle’s speed:**

* The cat runs 15 feet per second.
* The turtle's speed is one-fifth (1/5) of the cat's speed.
* Therefore, the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

**3. Calculate the turtle's distance:**

* We know the turtle travels for 40 seconds. 
* Distance = speed * time
* So, distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet

 {The final answer is 120 feet} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

*  Divide the number of quarts of chocolate ice cream made by the time it takes: 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts/hour

**2. Calculate the production rate per hour for vanilla ice cream:**

* Divide the number of quarts of vanilla ice cream made by the time it takes: 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts/hour

**3. Calculate the total production rate for both ice creams:**

*  Add the production rates from step 1 and step 2: 50 quarts/hour + 12.5 quarts/hour = 62.5 quarts/hour


**4. Calculate the total quarts made in 48 hours:**

*  Multiply the total production rate per hour by the number of hours: 62.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 3000 quarts


{The final answer is 3000 quarts} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

At check out, Marcus shows his loyalty card that gives him 10% off of his purchase.  What , is Marcus' total bill?<end_of_turn>
*Step by Stepped Reasoning*:

1. **Calculate the cost of the croissants:**
    * Cost of croissants: 5 croissants * $3.00/croissant = $15.00

2. **Calculate the cost of the cinnamon rolls:**
    * Cost of cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls * $2.50/cinnamon roll = $10.00

3. **Calculate the cost of the mini quiches:**
    * Cost of mini quiches: 3 mini quiches * $4.00/mini quiche = $12.00

4. **Calculate the cost of the blueberry muffins:**
    * Cost of blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins * $1.00/muffin = $13.00

5. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   * Total cost:  $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

6. **Calculate the amount of the discount:**
   * Discount: $50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00

7. **Calculate the final bill after applying the discount:**
   * Final bill: $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00


 {The final answer is $45.00}

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00
4 cinnamon rolls cost $2.50 each so they cost 4*2.5 =$<<4*2.5=10.00>>10.00
3 mini quiches cost $4.00 each so they cost 3*4 = $<<3*4=12.00>>12.00

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Determine the cost of two scoops.**

*  Each scoop costs $1.50.
*  Two scoops cost 2 * $1.50 = $3.00.

**Step 2: Figure out how many scoops Erin can buy with her money.**

* Erin has $6.00.
* She can purchase $3.00 / $1.50 = 2 scoops. 


**Step 3: Determine the number of scoops Erin can get with the deal.**

* The deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 free. 
* So Erin can buy 2 scoops + 1 free scoop = 3 scoops.  
  
**Step 4: Answer the question**

 Erin can buy 3 scoops of ice cream.          
{The final answer is 3}  
<end_of_turn><eos>","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Calculate Ginger's total candy consumption after two weeks:**
    * Candy eaten per day: 4 pieces
    * Number of days in two weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days
    * Total candy eaten: 4 pieces/day * 14 days = 56 pieces

**2. Calculate Amy's total candy consumption after two weeks:**
    * Candy eaten per day: 3 pieces
    * Number of days in two weeks: 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days
    * Total candy eaten: 3 pieces/day * 14 days = 42 pieces

**3. Find the difference in candy between Ginger and Amy:**
    *  Total candy for Amy: 100 pieces
    *  Total candy for Ginger : 100 pieces – 56 pieces = 44 pieces
   

**4. Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger:**
    * Difference:  44 pieces – 42 pieces = 2 pieces

**Final Answer**: The final answer is 2 pieces. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day

Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Calculate the total cost of picking blueberries from James's method:**

*  He spends $20 for the trip.
*  He spends  $1.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $45 on blueberries.
*  Total cost from his method: $20 + $45 = $65

**2. Calculate the total cost of buying blueberries from the store:**

*  He pays $2.5 per pound * 30 pounds = $75 
 
**3. Determine his savings:**

*  Savings = Total cost from his method - Total cost using a store 
*  Savings = $65 - $75 = -$10


**The final answer is - $10**

Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the ; pothole?<end_of_turn>
 

**Solution:**

1. **Identify all costs involved:** 
   *  Damage to car: $450
   *  Fine from the city: $120
   *  Cost of asphalt: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $75
   
2. **Calculate the total costs if Ron does not fix the pothole:** This will consist of the damage cost and the fine.
   *  Total cost without fixing = $450 + $120 = $570

3. **Calculate the total cost if Ron fixes the pothole:** This includes the cost of asphalt, the fine and the initial pothole damage.
    *  Total cost with fixing = $75 + $120 + $450 = $645 

4. **Find the money Ron saves by fixing the pothole:** 
   *  Savings = Total cost of NOT fixing – Total cost of fixing 
   *  Savings = $570 – $645 = -$75

5. **Final Answer:**  The final answer is {Ron loses $75 by fixing the pothole}. 
 

 
**Explanation:**

This problem requires a step-by-step approach. First, we break down all the costs, then we compare these costs to determine the amount Ron saves or loses. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.**

* Bryce and his two friends ate 2/3 of the pizzas.
*  (2/3) * 12 slices = 8 slices
*  Bryce and his friends ate 8 slices.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices for the remaining friends.**

* The two remaining friends ate ¾ of the pizzas.
* (3/4) * 12 slices = 9 slices
* The two remaining friends ate 9 slices.

**Step 3: Calculate the total slices eaten by all friends.**

*  Total slices eaten: 8 slices + 9 slices = 17 slices.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of slices remaining.**

*  Total slices: 12 slices/pizza * 5 pizzas = 60 slices
*  Slices remaining: 60 slices - 17 slices = 43 slices

{The final answer is 43 slices} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                    question:
                    A cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat ? takes. Calculate the ! average time the two take the eat the sausages.<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Find the dog’s time:** 
    * The dog eats the same amount of sausages as the cat in 2/3 the amount of time.
    * This means the dog takes (30 minutes) * (2/3) = 20 minutes.
   
2. **Calculate the average time:**  
    * To find the average time, add the cat's time and the dog's time and divide the sum by 2.
    * The average time is (30 minutes) + (20 minutes) = 50 minutes. 
    * The final answer is {The average time the two take to eat the sausages is 50 minutes} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

                    ; Topher, the green giant, wears enormous shoes.  The length of one of his shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  If the length of one of ; Topher’s shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, how long, in inches, is one ! of Bobby’s shoes?<end_of_turn>
 
Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Convert Everything to Inches:**

*  **Topher's shoe length:** 8 feet = 96 inches (Remember 1 foot = 12 inches). 4 inches
*  **Bobby's shoe length:** We need to find this in inches.

**2. Set up an Equation:**

*  Let 'x' represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
*  Topher's shoe length is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length: 9x + 10 = 96

**3. Solve for 'x':**

*  Subtract 10 from both sides: 9x = 86 
*  Divide both sides by 9: x = 9.56 (rounded to two decimal places)   


**4. Answer:**
The length of one of Bobby's shoes is 9.56 inches

 {The final answer is 9.56 inches} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**1. Identify the blue spools:**

   * Light blue: 15 spools
   * Dark blue: 45 spools

**2.  Find the total number of blue spools:** 

   * Total blue spools: 15 + 45 = 60 spools

**3. Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**

  * Percentage of blue spools = (Number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100%
  * Percentage of blue spools = (60 / (15+45+40+50)) * 100%
  * Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100%
  * Percentage of blue spools = 0.4 * 100%
  * Percentage of blue spools = 40%

 
**The final answer is: 40%**

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

**Step 1: Figure out the number of people who voted by midday.**

*  2/5 of 5000 people is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people remaining after midday.**

*  5000 people - 2000 people = 3000 people.

**Step 3: Figure out the number of people who voted by 16:00.**

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let ""D"" represent Dora's age.
*  Let ""F"" represent Dora's father's age.
*  Let ""M"" represent Dora's mother's age.

**2. Set Up Equations based on the Given Information:**

*  **Equation 1:**  ""Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age"" 
   *  F = 2D + 8 
*  **Equation 2:** ""Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father""
   *  M = F - 4 
*  **Equation 3:**""Dora is 15 years old""
   *  D = 15

**3. Solve for the Unknown Age:**

*  **Substitute** the value of D from Equation 3 into Equation 1:
    *  F = 2(15) + 8
    *  F = 30 + 8
    *  F = 38 
*  **Substitute** the value of F into Equation 2:
    *  M = 38 - 4
    *  M = 34

**4. Calculate the Total Combined Age:**

  *  Total Age = Dora's Age + Father's Age + Mother's Age
  *  Total Age = D + F + M
  *  Total Age = 15 + 38 + 34
  *  Total Age = 87


{The final answer is 87}<end_of_turn><eos>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the number of votes candidate B got.**
* Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.
*  50% of 20% = (50/100) * 20% = 10%
*  Therefore, candidate B got 20% + 10% = 30% of the votes.

**2. Calculate the number of votes candidate C got.**
*  The remaining votes were given to candidate C. 
* We know candidate A received 20% of the votes, and candidate B received 30%
*  The total votes for A and B are 20% + 30% = 50%
*  The number of votes candidate C got should be 100% - 50% = 50% of the votes.

{The final answer is 40}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.
Candidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.
Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find out how many apples Beck has.** 
   -  Boris has 100 apples.
   -  Beck has 23 fewer than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples. 

**Step 2: Find the number of apples left for Boris.** 
   -  Boris gives Beck 10 apples, leaving him with 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

**Step 3: Determine the difference between Beck's initial apples and the ones he has now.**
   -  Beck initially had 77 apples.
   -  He has 10 fewer apples than before, leaving him with 77 - 10 = 67 apples.

**Step 4:  Find the difference between Boris's apples and the ones he has.** 
   -  Boris has 90 apples.
   -  Remember, Beck has 67 apples.
  The Difference: 90 - 67 = 23

**Step 5:  Answer the question.**
   -  Beck has 67 apples. 
   -  Boris has 90 apples
   -  Boris has 23 more apples than Beck.
{The final answer is 23} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

If , he makes 3 giant cubes, ! 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes, how many ounces of water does he have , left?<end_of_turn>
 

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1. Calculate the total ounces for giant cubes:**

* 3 giant cubes * 4 ounces/cube = 12 ounces

**2. Calculate the total ounces for medium cubes:**

* 7 medium cubes * 2 ounces/cube = 14 ounces

**3. Calculate the total ounces for small cubes:**

* 8 small cubes * (1/2 ounce/cube) = 4 ounces

**4. Calculate the total ounces used:**

* 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces

**5.  Calculate the ounces left:**

* 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces


{The final answer is 2 ounces} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Find out how many books Steven has.**

* We know Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
* Since Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation: 2 * Steven = 20 
* Divide both sides by 2: Steven = 10 books

**Step 2: Determine how many books Alice has.**

* We know Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
* Therefore, Alice has: 10 + 6 = 16 books.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between Clara's and Alice's books.**

*  Clara has 20 books, and Alice has 16.
*  The difference is: 20 - 16 = 4 books.

**Here's how we can break down the problem:**

1. **Find the cost of a half-gallon jar:** 
    * We know a gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, so the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the 10-gallon jars:**
    * The total cost of 10 gallon jars would be 10 * $5 = $50. 

3. **Calculate the total cost of the 16 half-gallon jars:**
    * The total cost of 16 half-gallon jars would be 16 * $3 = $48.

4. **Calculate the final total cost:**
    * The total cost of both types of jars is $50 + $48 = $98.

Here's how we can break down the problem step by step:

**1. Students who like video games or music:**

* We start by finding the total number of students who like to bake, play basketball, or play video games or music.
* This can be found by subtracting the number of students who like baking, and basketball. 

**2.  Find students who like video games:**

* This can be found by subtracting the number of students who like baking and basketball, and the number who like video games.

**3. Calculate the precise number of students who like music**

* We can calculate the exact number of students who like to play music by dividing twice the number who like basketball.

* Provide clear explanation, step-by-step reasoning, and avoid any ambiguity

Let's break down this problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the number of students in each class.

**Step 2: formulate an Equation**

* The total number of students is 80, so 2x = 80 

**Step 3: Solve for x**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 2:  x = 40

**Step 4: Calculate the number of girls in each class**

* 40% of the students are girls, so each class has 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls. 

**Step 5: Find the number of boys in each class**

*  The number of boys in each class is x - 16 


{The final answer is 34}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.

**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

1. **Cost of the packs:**
   - Mark bought 3 packs at $1800 each. 
   - Cost of 3 packs = 3 * $1800 = $5400

2. **Value of the special cards:**
   - The card worth $4000 is rare, and the one worth $1000 is above average.
   - Total value of special cards = $4000 + $1000 = $5000

3. **Value of the additional cards:**
   - Average value of the additional cards is $50.
   - The number of additional cards is 30 more than the original.
   - Total value of additional cards = 30 * $50 = $1500

4. **Total value of the cards Mark acquired:**
   - Remember, we already calculated the cost of the packs.
   - Total value of all cards =  $5400 + $5000 + $1500 = $12000 

5. **Profit calculation:**
   - Profit = Total value of the cards - Cost of the packs
   - Profit = $12000 - $5400 = $6600


{The answer is $6600}


<end_of_turn><eos>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500

Let's work it out!

 
**Solution**

*Step 1: Identify the initial amount of bananas.*
The problem tells us that Gunther started with 48 bananas. {This is our starting point.}

*Step 2: Calculate the number of bananas Arnold took.*
Arnold stole half of Gunther's bananas, which is 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.  {We find this by dividing the initial amount of bananas by 2}

*Step 3: Calculate the number of bananas Gunther gained.*
Gunther added 25 bananas to his pile. {Gunther gains 25 bananas.}

*Step 4: Calculate the number of bananas after Arnold's thefts.* 
 After Arnold took bananas, Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas remaining. {Here we're subtracting the bananas that went missing.}

*Step 5: Determine the final number of bananas in the pile.* 
Gunther gained 25 bananas and now has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas . {Here we add the new bananas from the previous step.}

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the unknowns:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of votes against the new regulation.
    *  Let '2x' represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.

2. **Formulate the equation:** The total votes for and against the new regulation should add up to the total number of people on the council.
   *  x + 2x = 33

3. **Solve for x:** Combine like terms on the left side of the equation.  
   *  3x = 33

4. **Isolate x:** Divide both sides of the equation by 3.  
   *  x = 11

5. **Solve for the number of votes in favor:** Substitute the value of 'x' into the equation for the number of votes in favor.
  * 2x = 2 * 11 = 22


**The final answer is 22. ** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

Here's how we'll break down the problem:

**1. Figure out the number of extra-small shirts:**
   - Krissa needs 11 extra-small shirts.

**2. Figure out the number of small shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need small shirts as extra-small, so 11 x 2 = 22 small shirts are needed.

**3. Figure out the number of medium shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of small shirts means 22 - 4 =  18 medium shirts are needed.

**4. Figure out the number of medium shirts:**
   - Half as many students need medium shirts as size large, so 18 / 2 = 9 medium shirts.

**5. Figure out the number of large shirts:**
   - Six more students need large shirts than medium shirts, so 9 + 6 = 15 large shirts are needed.

**6. Figure out the number of extra-large shirts:**
   - Six more students need extra-large shirts than large shirts, so 15 + 6 = 21 extra-large shirts are needed.

**7. Calculate the total number of shirts:**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Define the variables.**

*  Let: 
    *  x = the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house.
    *  y = the number of cases of shingles needed for the third house.

**Step 2: Translate the given information into equations.**

*  First house needs 1/2 the amount needed for the second:  x = (1/2) * y
*  The third house needs double the first: y = 2 * x
*  Total cases: x + y + 250 = 250 (We know the total needed is 250)


**Step 3: Solve the system of equations.**

*  We have two equations: 
   * x = (1/2) * y 
   * y = 2 * x
*  To solve for x and y, we can substitute the second equation into the first. 
 * (1/2) * y = x

**Step 4:  Solve for y** 

* Substitute the second equation and find a value for x: 
  * y = 2 * x


**Step 5: Find the value of x and y**

{The final answer is.}

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Ahmed's books read:**

* Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, meaning Ahmed read half the number of books.
* Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books in one hour.

**2. Find the total books Ezra read:**

* Ezra read 300 books in one hour and then read 150 more.
* Ezra's total read in one hour: 300 + 150 = 450 books

**3. Find the total books Ahmed read:**

* Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. 

**4. Find the total books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:**

* Total books read: 450 + 150 = 600 books


 
 {The final answer is} 600.<end_of_turn><eos>","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate Tanya's earnings from Monday:**

*  Hourly rate: $15
*  Hours worked: 5 hours 
*  Earnings from Monday: $15 * 5 = $75

**2. Calculate Tanya's earnings from Wednesday:**

*  Hourly rate: $15
*  Hours worked: 2 hours
*  Earnings from Wednesday: $15 * 2 = $30

**3. Calculate extra earnings for classes over 3:**

*  Classes on Monday: 4 classes
*  Classes on Wednesday: 2 classes
*  Extra earnings: $5/day * (4 classes - 3 ) = $5/day * 1 = $5

**4. Find Tanya's total earnings**

*  Earnings from Monday: $75
*  Earnings from Wednesday: $30
*  Extra earnings for classes over 3: $5

*Total earnings: $75 + $30 + $5 = $110.


 {The final answer is $110} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.
She earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate Bennet's earnings from the eggplants.**

* He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each. 
* Earnings from eggplants = 20 * $3 = $60

**Step 2: Determine the amount needed from the corn sales.**

* He wants to make a total of $135.
* Earnings from eggplants: $60
* Amount needed from corn sales = $135 - $60 = $75

**Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn needed.**

* He has 25 ears of corn to sell.
* Earnings from corn = $75
* Price per ear of corn =  $75 / 25 = $3


{The final answer is $3}

She is , dividing her time between soccer, video games, and reading. If she reads for 3 hours ! and plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, ? what percentage of her weekend does she spend playing soccer?<end_of_turn>


**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate total time spent on reading and video games:**
    * Saturday: 7 hours
    * Sunday: 5 hours
    * Total time: 7 + 5 = 12 hours 

2. **Calculate the remaining time for video games:**
    * Total Time - Time spent reading & video games = Time remaining for Video games
    * 12 - 3 = 9 hours


3. **Calculate the amount of time spent on video games:**
    * Time remaining for video games * (1/3) = Time spent on video games
    * 9 hours * (1/3) = 3 hours

4. **Calculate total time spent on soccer, reading, and video games:**
    * Time spent on reading + Time spent on Video games = Total time on all Activities

 5. **Calculate the percentage of time spent on soccer:**
   * (Time spent on soccer) / (Total time spent) * 100 = Percent of time spent on Soccer

6. **Calculate total time spent playing soccer:** 
     * 7 hours (Saturday) + 5 hours (Sunday) = 12 hours


7. **Calculate the percentage of time spent on soccer: **
 
*Here is a breakdown of the calculation process*

* **Time spent on soccer:** 12 hours
* **Total time spent on reading & video games:**  9 hours


 
{The final answer is 66.67% }

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Find the number of pencils given to Brandon.**

*  (1/2) * 50 pencils = 25 pencils

**Step 2: Find the number of pencils remaining after giving to Brandon.**

* 50 pencils - 25 pencils = 25 pencils 

**Step 3: Find the number of pencils given to Charlie.**

* Time = 150 miles / 75 mph
* Time = 2 hours

**3. Calculate the total time spent at the museum and traveling:**

* Total time = Time to museum + Time back + Time at museum
* Total time = 2 hours + 2 hours + 6 hours
* Total time = 10 hours

 **4. Determine the total time away from home.**

*  Time away from home = Total time 
*  Time away from home = 10 hours

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the number of series movies.**  

*  A third of 600 movies is (1/3) * 600 = 200 movies.

**2. Determine the number of regular movies.**  

*  Total movies - series movies = regular movies.
*  600 - 200 = 400 movies.  

**3.  Calculate the cost of the series movies.**   

*  Cost of a series movie is $6
*  Number of series movies = 200.
*  The cost of all series movies = 200 * $6 = $1200.

**4. Calculate the number of older movies.** 

*  40% of 400 movies = 0.40 * 400 = 160 older movies.


**5. Calculate the total cost of the regular movies.**  

*  Cost of a regular movie is$10. 
*  Number of regular movies= 400. 
*  The total cost of all regular movies = 400 * $10 = $4000

**6. Calculate the total cost of the older movies.** 

*  Cost of an older movie is $5
*  Number of older movies = 160.
*  The total cost of all older movies = 160 * $5 = $800.

** 7.Calculate the total cost.**  


*   Total cost = cost of series movies + cost of regular movies + cost of older movies 
*   Total cost = $1200 + $4000 + $800 
*   Total cost = $5000

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Calculate the driving speed:**

* The family's speed driving is given as 50 miles per hour. 

**2. Find the hiking speed:**

* Half of the driving speed is 50 miles / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
* The hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, so their hiking speed is 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

**3. Calculate the total distance travelled:**
* Distance travelled during the driving part of the trip is: 50 mph * 6 hours = 300 miles.

**4. Calculate the distance travelled during hiking:**

*  Distance travelled during the hiking part is: 20 mph * 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

**5. Calculate the total distance:**

* The total distance travelled is 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.



**Final Answer: The vacation spot was 330 miles away.**<end_of_turn><eos>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.

                    Four friends ordered four pizzas : for a total of 64 dollars. If two of the pizzas , cost 30 dollars, how much did . each of the other two pizzas cost if they cost the same . amount?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the cost of each of the other two pizzas.

**2. Set up an equation:**

* The total cost of the pizzas is $64.
* The cost of two pizzas is $30. 
* The cost of the other two pizzas is x*2 

The equation is: 30 + x*2 = 64

**3. Solve the equation:**

* Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: x*2 = 34
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 17.

**4. Answer:**

 The other two pizzas cost $17 each.


{The final answer is $17}<end_of_turn><eos>","The other two pizzas cost 64-30 = <<64-30=34>>34 dollars.
Each of the other two pizzas cost 34/2 = <<34/2=17>>17 dollars each.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning**

1. **Normal Riding:** 
   * They ride their bikes 3 times per day * 5 days = 15 times.
   
2. **Increased Riding:**
   * On two other days they ride twice as much: 3 times/day * 2 = 6 times per day.
   
3. **Total Increase:**  They increase their riding by 6 times per day.

4. **Total Weekly Riding:** We calculate their normal riding and increased riding to find their total weekly riding.
   * Total weekly riding = 15 times + 6 times/day * 2 days = 15 + 12 = 27 times

**The final answer is 27** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

When he got them home and added them to his pond, , he found that ! he now had twice as many : orange fish as white fish. How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?<end_of_turn>
* The problem asks how many white fish Bob bought at the store, so let's focus on finding that number.

* We'll use information from the problem, including the initial number of fish Bob had and the number of orange and white fish after adding the new fish.

* We can set up an equation and solve it to discover the number of white fish Bob purchased. 

* The equation should account for the change in number of orange fish and white fish.




```
Here's how we solve the problem:
**1. Starting Data:**

* Bob begins with 7 fish.
* 3 are orange.
* 4 are white. 

**2. Finding the new Fish Count:**

* After adding the new fish, Bob has a total of 7 + 17 = 24 fish. 

**3. Analyzing the Orange-White Ratio:**

*  After adding fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. 
*  We need to translate this into an equation.


```


**4. Setting up the equation:**

* Because Bob's orange fish count doubled after adding to his existing number, we need to set up an equation that reflects this relationship
* Let's use this idea.
  *  Lets call the number of white fish 'w'.
  *  The number of orange fish is 2w.




 


```
{The final answer is 4}
```<end_of_turn><eos>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how much money is Andy's car ; consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday : to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate weekly mileage:**

* Andy drives 5 miles to work each way, so he drives a total of 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles per day.
* Assuming Monday to Friday only, he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles per week

**2. Calculate weekly fuel consumption:**

* Fuel consumption is measured in gallons.
* He uses 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas per week

**3. Calculate the total cost of fuel:**

* Cost per gallon: $3/gallon
* Total weekly fuel cost: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15 


{The final answer is $15} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the value of the quarters:**

* There are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25
* The total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35

**2. Calculate the value of the twenties:**

*  Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties,  which means she spent 3/5 * 10 twenties = 6 twenties. 
*  Each twenty is worth $2
 *  The total value of the spent twenties is 6 * $2 = $12

**3. Calculate the total spent:** 

*  The total amount spent for lunch is $35 (from the quarters) + $12 (from the twenties) = $47


**The final answer is:** $47

<end_of_turn><eos>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120

*Understanding the Problem:*

1. **Identify the fractions representing the different types of TVs:**
   - Smart TVs: 1/4
   - Analog TVs: 1/8
   - OLED TVs: 3/4

2. **Set up the equation to find the number of OLED TVs sold.**
   - Total TVs sold = Smart TVs + Analog TVs + OLED TVs
   - 40 = (1/4) * Total TVs + (1/8) * Total TVs + (3/4) * Total TVs


*Solving the Equation*:

3. **Find a common denominator.**
   - The common denominator for these fractions is 8.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the known information:**
   - John has $50.
   - The school will cover half the cost, meaning they will contribute $50. 
   - The total cost of the trip is $300.

2. **Calculate the amount the school is covering:**

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**Step 1: Analyze the temperature difference.**

* The temperature during the night is 33 degrees, which is 3 degrees colder than the day's temperature (45 degrees).
 
**Step 2: Calculate the heating needed.**

* The house needs to be heated by 5 degrees for every log of wood burned.
* The temperature difference between night and day requires a minimum heating amount, so we are looking for how many degrees more our house can heat.
 * We need to bring the temperature up by 3 degrees to be safe.

**Step 3: Determine the number of logs.**

* Since it's a simple heating scenario.
* Each log provides 5 degrees of heat, therefore, Carson needs to burn logs to reach a temperature. 
     {The final answer is 0}




<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees

Here's the step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:

**1. Determine the number of groups:**

*  People are divided into groups of 9, so we need to find out how many groups were formed.
*  We're given that 90 people were split into groups, and each group has 9 people.
*  Number of groups = Number of people / Group size  
*  Number of groups = 90 people / 9 people/group = 10 groups

**2. Calculate the number of seashells collected by each group:**
*  3/5 of the number of groups will collect seashells
*  3/5 * 10 groups = 6 groups

**3. Calculate the total number of seashells brought by each group:**
* 6 groups * 2 seashells/group * = 12 seashells. 


**4. Final answer:**

If 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bringing back 2 seashells each, then 3/5*10=<<3/5*10=6>>6 groups had members bringing back 2 seashells.
Since each group had 9 people, the number of people in the 6 groups, who found 2 seashells each, was 6*9= <<6*9=54>>54.
The total number of seashells the 54 people brought is 54*2=<<54*2=108>>108 seashells.

                    question:
                    A company's HR ? hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. , If the company's initial employee number is 200, and each employee is paid a , $4000 ; salary per month, calculate the . total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the number of employees hired in each month:**

* The company hires 20 new employees each month.

**2. Determine the total monthly salary costs:**

* Each employee earns a $4000 salary.
* The company hires 20 employees every month.
* Therefore, the monthly salary cost is 20 * $4000 = $80,000

**3. Calculate the total salary cost after three months:**

* The total salary cost after three months is $80,000/month * 3 months = $240,000 {The final answer is}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Identify the songs**

* The choir will sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice.
* The choir will sing ""Jingle Bells"" once.

**Step 2: Calculate the time for ""Deck the Halls""**

* ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
* They will sing it twice, 
* So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds/song * 2 songs = 300 seconds.

**Step 3: Calculate the time for ""Jingle Bells""**

* ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

**Step 4: Calculate the total caroling time**

* Total caroling time = time for ""Deck the Halls"" + time for ""Jingle Bells""
* Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.



**The final answer is: 540 seconds.**<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total time the choir spends singing ""Deck the Halls"": 2 * 150 seconds = <<2*150=300>>300 seconds
Then add that time to the time spent singing ""Jingle Bells"": 300 seconds + 240 seconds = <<300+240=540>>540 seconds

Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Billy's new starting salary:**

* Billy's original hourly rate: $10
* Raise after two months: $0.50
* New starting rate: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50

**2. Calculate Billy's salary after one year:**

*  New starting rate: $10.50
*  Raise on his anniversary: $1.00
*  Total salary increase: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50

**3. Calculate Sally's starting hourly rate:**

* Billy's starting hourly rate is $10.50.
* Sally's salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's.
* Sally's starting rate:  $10.50 + $0.50 = $11.00


**4. Calculate Billy's total earnings:**

* Billy's hourly rate: $11.50
* Hours worked: 20
* Total earnings: $11.50 x 20 = $230.00

**5. Calculate Sally's total earnings:**

* Sally's hourly rate: $11.00
* Hours worked: 20
* Total earnings: $11.00 x 20 = $220.00

 
**6. Compare Billy's and Sally's total earnings:**

* Billy earns $230.00
* Sally earns $220.00

**7. Determine the difference in earnings.**

* Difference: $230.00 - $220.00 = $10.00

 


{The final answer is $10.00}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

If she wants to buy enough ; stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals**:
    * Bubbles has 3 puppies + 5 koalas + 2 zebras + 4 frogs = 14 stuffed animals. 
2. **Calculate the number of stuffed goats**:
    *  30% of 14 stuffed animals is (30/100) * 14 = 4.2 stuffed goats. 
3. **Round up to the nearest whole number**:

**Step 1:** Determine how many days Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. 
**Step 2:** Determine how many days Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. 
**Step 3:** Calculate the total hours Kris plays in each period.
**Step 4:** Subtract the total hours played for each period from the total required hours.
**Step 5:** Express the remaining hours in a final answer.

Let's break down the solution:

**Step 1:**
* Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which means 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days. 
* Kris plays for half an hour every day for 14 days. 

**Step 2:**
* Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week, meaning 7 days/week * 2 hours/day = 14 hours

**Step 3:** 
* Total hours played for both periods: 14 days * 30/2 = 210 hours
 
**Step 4:** 
* Hours remaining: 30 hours - 210 hours = -180 hours

**Step 5:** {The final answer is -180 hours }



<end_of_turn><eos>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We have two cars traveling at different speeds.
* We need to find the distance between the cars over a defined time interval.

**2. Calculate Distance Traveled by the First Car:**

* Distance = Speed x Time 
* Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
* Distance = 120 miles

**3. Calculate Distance Traveled by the Second Car:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 70 mph x 2 hours
* Distance = 140 miles

**4.  Find the Difference in Distance:**

* Difference = Second Car's Distance - First Car's Distance
* Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles 
* Difference = 20 miles

 



{The final answer is} 20 miles.<end_of_turn><eos>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.
Thus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.

*Hint: Calculate pass rate for fourth grade,  pass rate for fifth grade, and finally calculate overall pass rate.*


**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Calculate the pass rate for fourth grade:** 
   * 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed.
   *  Pass rate for 4th grade = (40/100) = 0.4  

2. **Calculate the pass rate for fifth grade:** 
   * Pass rate for 5th grade = 2 * 0.4 = 0.8

3. **Calculate the overall pass rate:** 
   * Total pass rate = (340/500) + (40/100) + (0.8 * 400) 
   * Total pass rate = (340/500) + (40/100) + 320/100
   * Total pass rate = 0.68 + 0.4 + 3.2


 {The final answer is 4.38} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4
Then double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8
Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students
Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%

He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this step by step:

1. **Starting Inventory:** Dale began with 100 candies.
2. **Sales:** He sells 150  butterscotch candies, leaving him with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. 
3. **New Order:**  He orders 100 more candies, bringing his total to 100 + 100 = 200. 
4. **Remaining Candies:**  He needs to sell 200 - 100 = 100 candies to sell all his candies.


{The final answer is 100 } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Understand the Information:**

* Felix earns $105 during the week.
* Each branch cost $0.25 to climb.
* We need to find the average number of branches per day.

**2. Calculate Total Branch Costs:**

* We know Felix earns $105 total over the week.
* To get a daily average, we need to divide the total earnings by the number of days in a week, and then divide that number by 7

**3. Determine the Number of Daily Climbs:**

* Multiply the earnings per climb by the number of days the tree climber works. 
* Divide the total earnings by the earnings per climb

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Flowers with 5 petals:**

* Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
* Total petals from these flowers: 3 flowers * 5 petals/flower = 15 petals

**2. Flowers with 6 petals:**

* Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
* Total petals from these flowers: 4 flowers * 6 petals/flower = 24 petals

**3. Flowers with 4 petals:**

{The final answer is 101}<end_of_turn><eos>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.

**Solution:**

1. **Total marshmallows used:**  John makes 9 s'mores, and DeSean makes 9 s'mores. That means they used a total of 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.
2. **Marshmallows remaining:**  The bag has 35 marshmallows and they used 18 marshmallows. Therefore, they have 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.
3. **S'mores each kid can have:** Each kid can have 17 marshmallows / S'mores = 17 / 9 s'mores.

* **Friend 1:** Can play half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes.
* **Friend 2:**  Can play half as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes.
* **Friend 3:**  Can play 1.5 times as long as Jack, so they play for 20 minutes * 1.5 = 30 minutes.

**2. Calculate the total time all friends play:**

* They play for 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.

**3. Determine the combined playing time split between each friend:**

* Jack: 20 minutes
* Friend 1: 10 minutes

Here's what you've written so far.



Let me know when you're ready for feedback on your solution!
<end_of_turn>* **Step 1: Define variables.** 
   Let  `x` represent the amount of salt in ounces.
   Let `y` represent the amount of citrus zest in ounces.
   Let `z` represent the amount of oil in ounces. 
   Let `w` represent the amount of fragrance in ounces.
   

* **Step 2: Create an equation.**
   We know she uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, and the same amount of salt as sugar. 
   This means y = w and x = w. 
   We know she uses twice as much oil as salt, so  z = 2x
   We know she uses twice as much salt as zest, so x = 2y.
  
* **Step 3: Solve for the unknown variable.**
   The easiest way to solve for the amount of oil is by plugging the values of x, y, and z into the appropriate equation for oil.
   We can first solve for y in terms of x using the equation x=2y.
   Finally, we can plug this value of y and use that in the equation for z.  

    

{The final answer is} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate Joe's cars:**

* Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. 
* Joe's cars = 2 * 20 = 40 cars.

**2. Calculate cars sold to Robert's mother:**

* Joe sold 20% of his cars. 
* This means Joe sold 40 * 0.20 = 8 cars to his mother.

**3. Calculate cars given away:**

* Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.
* He gives away 8 * 2 = 16 cars.

**4. Calculate cars remaining after selling and giving away:**

*  Cars remaining = Cars initially - Cars sold
*  Cars remaining = 40 - 8 -16 = 16 cars.

*

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find Julie's score in the first game.**

* Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored 4 fewer than Sasha.
* Julie's score in the first game = 14 - 4 = 10 points.

**Step 2: Find Sasha's score in the second game.**

* The second game was at Julie's home court, and Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
* Sasha's score in the second game = 10 - 6 = 4 points. 

**Step 3: Find the total points Sasha scored.**

* Total points for both games = 14 + 4 = 18 points.


{The final answer is 18}   
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points, and Julie scored four fewer points: 14-4 = <<14-4=10>>10 points.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 points fewer than Julie's score in the first game, meaning she scored 10-6=<<10-6=4>>4 points.
Sasha scored 10+4=<<10+4=14>>14 points in the two games.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of blue eggs:**

* Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 green * 2 = 10 blue eggs.

**2. Calculate the number of pink eggs:**

* Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 blue - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

**3. Calculate the number of yellow eggs:**

* Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 pink / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

**4. Calculate the total number of eggs:**

* Combine the number of each egg type: 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = 27 eggs.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the shipping fee:** 
    *  Weight * Rate per pound = Shipping cost
    *  4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40 

2. **Calculate the mileage fee:**

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the production in the second week:**

*  Boris produces half as much in the second week as the first week.
*  Production in the second week = (1/2) * 8,000 bars = 4,000 bars

**2. Calculate the production in the third week:**

*  Boris produces three times as much chocolate in the third week as the first week.
*  Production in the third week = 3 * 8,000 bars = 24,000 bars

**3. Calculate the total production for the first three weeks:**

*  Total production for the three weeks = 8,000 bars + 4,000 bars + 24,000 bars = 36,000 bars

**4. Calculate the production for the fourth week:**

*  Production in the fourth week = Total production for all weeks - Total production for the previous three weeks.
*  Production in the fourth week = 50,000 bars - 36,000 bars = 14,000 bars


{The final answer is 14,000 bars}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1.  Understand the Relationships:**

*   **Naruto>Kagiyami:** Naruto can lift ten times higher than Kagiyami.
*   **Kagiyami>Saskay:** Kagiyami can lift four times higher than Saskay.
*   **Saskay>Pompei:** Saskay can lift twelve times higher than Pompei.

**2.  Work From the Bottom Up:**

We need to work our way up the relationships to find the ultimate height Naruto can lift.  


*   **Pompei's limit:**  Pompei can lift 1 inch.

**3.  Determining Saskay's limit:**

*   **Saskay lifting height:** Saskay can lift twelve times higher than Pompei, so they can lift 12 * 1 = 12 inches.

**4.  Finding Kagiyami's limit:**

*   **Kagiyami lifting height:** Kagiyami can lift four times higher than Saskay, so they can lift 4*12 = 48 inches

**5.  Naruto's limit:**

*   **Naruto lifting height:** Naruto can lift ten times higher than Kagiyami. So Naruto can lift 10* 48 = 480 inches.
*    **Converting to Feet:** 480 inches / 12 inches/foot = 40 feet.



{The final answer is} 40 feet.<end_of_turn><eos>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 hours.**
   -  Distance = Rate × Time
   -  Distance = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours 
   -  Distance = 32 miles

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in the next 6 hours.**
   -  Distance = Rate × Time
   -  Distance = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Understand the Problem:**
* We need to figure out the time it takes four turtles to travel the same distance as a group of 3 kangaroos. 

**2.  Kangaroo Speed:** 
* We know 3 kangaroos complete the journey in 18 hours.
*  This means that one kangaroo takes 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours to complete the journey.

**3. Turtle Speed:** 
*  Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
*  Therefore, one turtle’s speed is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

*A diagram is not required*

**Solution:**
1. **Find out how many dishes Jada makes:** 
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, and Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   - Therefore, Jada makes 2 * Rory's dishes. 

2. **Find out how many dishes Rory makes:**
   - Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, who makes 20 dishes. 
   - So, Rory makes 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

3. **Find how many dishes Jada makes:**
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, who makes 40 dishes. 
   - So, Jada makes 2 * 40 = 80 dishes.

4. **Find the total number of dishes they all make:**
   - Adding the number of dishes each person makes together.
   - Jada: 80 dishes
   - Rory: 40 dishes
   - Kora: 20 dishes
   - Total: 80 + 40 + 20 = 140 dishes

Solution:
1. **Determine the current milk production:** The farmer currently obtains 5 liters/cow * 3 cows = 15 liters of milk per day.
2. **Calculate the difference in milk production:** To produce 25 liters of milk a day, he needs 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters more. 
3. **Identify the new number of cows:** To produce 10 liters of extra milk, the farmer needs to increase his cows by 10 liters / 5 liters/cow = 2 additional cows.

Here's how we can tackle this:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We need to find out the total length of unused glue sticks.
* The problem tells us the amount of glue left on each glue stick. 
* The original length of a glue stick is given as 12 millimeters.

**2. Calculate the Remaining Glue on Each Stick:**
*  Glue stick 1: (1/6) * 12 mm = 2 mm of glue remaining.
*  Glue stick 2: (2/3) * 12 mm = 8 mm of glue remaining
*  Glue stick 3: (1/2) * 12 mm = 6 mm of glue remaining.
 

**3. Total Glue Remaining:**
To find the total glue remaining, we add the remaining glue from each stick.
* 2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm of glue remaining. 

**4. Find the total Length of Glue Sticks not used:** 
 The total length of glue sticks that are not used is 16 mm. {The final answer is} 16 mm 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.

If she allows ? a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total time for each group's performance:**

* Stage preparation: 2 minutes
* Performance time: 6 minutes
* Stage exit: 2 minutes
* **Total time per group:** 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

   where: 
     * I is the interest earned
     * P is the principal
     * r is the interest rate
     * t is the time

3. **Calculate the interest earned in one year:**
    * I = Prt
    * I = $300 * 2.25 * 1
    * I = $675

4. **Find the total interest earned over three years:**
    * Total Interest = Interest per year * 3 years
    * Total Interest = $675 * 3
    * Total Interest = $2025

5. **Calculate the total amount after three years:**
   * Total Amount = Principal + Total Interest
   * Total Amount = $300 + $2025
   * Total Amount = $2325

                    question:
                    James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.  He ; spends $2640 on shoes each year.  , How much does he pay on average for each pair of shoes?<end_of_turn>
*I understand this is a relatively simple problem, but I want you to break it down for me like you were explaining it to a friend.*


Here's a breakdown:

**1. Understand the information given:**

* James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
* He spends $2640 on shoes each year.

**2. Determine the cost per month:**

* To find the cost per month, we need to divide the annual spending by the number of pairs per month.
*  Cost per month = Annual Spending / Number of Pairs per Month
*  Cost per month =  $2640 / 2 = $1320

**3. Determine the average cost per pair:**

* We've now found that James pays $1320 every month.
*  To find the average cost of each pair, we divide the monthly cost by the number of pairs per month.
* Average cost per pair = Cost per month / Number of Pairs per Month 
* Average cost per pair = $1320 / 2
*  Average cost per pair = $660 


 {The final answer is $660} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He buys 2*12=<<2*12=24>>24 pairs of shoes a year
So he spends 2640/24=$<<2640/24=110>>110 per pair

**Solution:**
1. **Determine the cost of one basket of red food:**
   * We know the cost of one basket of red food is $18.

2. **Calculate the discount on one basket of red food:**
   * The cost of each basket of red food is $18, and you get $2 off.
   * Discount = $18 - $2 = $16

3. **Calculate the cost of three baskets of red food:**
   * Cost of three baskets of red food = 3 * $16 = $48

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   * Total cost =  3 * $25 (Green food) + $48 (Red food) 
   *  Total cost = $75 + $48 
   *  Total cost = $123


{The final answer is $123} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.
The 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.
There will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.
So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the cleaning time for one room.**

* It takes 20 minutes to clean one room.

**Step 2:  Calculate the number of rooms to be cleaned.**

* We want to clean one-half of the rooms, meaning we need to clean 90 rooms / 2 = 45 rooms.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cleaning time.**

* We've already determined it takes 20 minutes per room.
* To clean 45 rooms, it will take 20 minutes/room * 45 rooms = 900 minutes

**Step 4: Convert minutes to hours.**

* There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.
* Therefore, 900 minutes is equal to 900 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours


**The final answer is 15 hours.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes
1800/2 = <<1800/2=900>>900 minutes
900 minutes = <<900/60=15>>15 hours
It would take 15 hours to clean 45 rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

**Solution:**
   1. **Year 1:** The town builds 12 homes. 
   2. **Year 2:** The town builds three times the number in year 1, so they will build 3 * 12 = 36 homes.
   3. **Total Homes to Year 2:** The town has a total of 12 homes + 36 homes = 48 homes. 
   4. **Year 3:** The Town doubles the number of homes they will have built in year 2, so they will build 48 homes * 2 = 96 homes.
   5. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:** The town's total built homes are 12 homes + 36 homes + 96 homes = {244 homes}

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","In the second year, they build three times as many homes as the first year which is 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 homes.

 Let's break this down step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'B' represent the age of your brother.
* Let 'S' represent the age of your sister.
* Let 'I' represent the age of you.

**2. Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

* **Equation 1:**  I = B - 3  (You are three years younger than your brother)
* **Equation 2:**  I = S + 2  (You are 2 years older than your sister)
* **Equation 3:**  Mom's age = 3B - 1  (Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age) 
* **Equation 4:**  I + B + S + Mom's age = 87  (The sum of all ages is 87)

**3. Solve the Equations:**

* We can use substitution or elimination methods to solve the equations.  Substitution seems the most convenient here.
   * Begin by substituting the values of I, B, and S from equations 1 and 2 in equation 4.
  
**4. Finding I:**

   * First, substitute the values of I from the Equations 1 and 2 in Equation 4
 
 



Let me know if you'd like me to continue working through the substitution or if you'd like to try a different method!  We need to solve our equations based on the given information. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of glue sticks needed.**

* Mr. Jackson wants to give each student 2 glue sticks.
* There are 27 students. 
* Total glue sticks needed: 2 glue sticks/student * 27 students = 54 glue sticks

**Step 2: Determine how many packs of glue sticks he needs.**

* Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
* Glue sticks needed: 54 glue sticks
*  Packs needed: 54 glue sticks / 8 glue sticks/pack = 6.75 packs

**Step 3: Account for whole packs only.**

*  Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs.
* This means he needs to buy 7 packs to have enough glue sticks.



{The final answer is 7}<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire , in the same time frame.  How many more badges does Wendy earn ; compared to Amber in a 1 year time frame?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step approach to the problem:

**1.  Calculate Amber's earning time:**

   * Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   * Amber takes twice as long as Claire, so she earns 1 badge * 2 = 2 badges per month.

**2. Calculate Claire's total badges in a year:**

   * Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   * In a year, Claire earns 1 badge/month * 12 months = 12 badges.

**3. Calculate Wendy's total badges in a year:**

*  `g` = the number of green cars
*  `b` = the number of blue cars

**Step 2:** Set up equations based on the given information.
We’re given several facts, let's translate them into equations:
* `r = g + 2` : The number of red cars is 2 more than the number of green cars.
* `b = 3g` : The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars.
* `r + g + b + y = 75` : The total number of cars is 75.



**Step 3:** Solve for the number of yellow cars. 
* We have three equations and three variables.
* We can solve for the number of yellow cars by substituting values into the equations.

**Step 4:**  Substitute and solve with the equations. 

* We don't know the exact number of green cars `g` or blue cars `b` so we may need to use trial and error. 
 

**Step 5:** Find the number of yellow cars based on your results from Step 4
* We will find the value of `g`. 
* We will set up a trial and error situation. 
  

**Step 6** Finalize the answer.


Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these steps.

                    question:
                    Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne , has 12 fewer books than Fawn does, how many books does Fawn have?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Define variables:**
    * Let  'x' represent the number of books Fawn has.

2. **Set up equations based on the information given:**
    * Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:  x - 25 = Sofie's books
    * Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:  x - 12 = Anne's books

3. **Use these equations to solve for Fawn's (x) number of books.**
    * Combine the two equations: x - 25 + (x - 12) = Fawn's books
    * Simplify: 2x - 37 = Fawn books

4. **Solve for x (number of books Fawn has).**
    *  2x - 37 = Fawn's books
    * Add 37 to both sides of the equation: 2x = Fawn's books


 

{The final answer is} Fawn has 2x book. 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 books
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the cost of the old rope:**

*  Cost = Length of rope * Price per meter
*  Cost = 20 meters * $2 per meter 
*  Cost = $40

**2. Calculate the amount Sarah will spend on the new rope:**

* Cost = Length of new rope * Price per meter
* Cost = 20 meters * $1.50 per meter 
* Cost = $30

**3. Determine the difference in Sarah's earnings and expenses:**

*  Difference = Cost of new rope - Cost of old rope
*  Difference = $30 - $40
*  Difference = -$10


**The Final answer is -$10** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Melanie's current age.**

*  In 10 years, she'll be 18.
*  Therefore, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8 years old.

**2. Determine the age in 10 years.**

*  In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. 

**3. Determine the age in 'x' years.**

*  The question asks ""in how many years will her age be thrice her present age?""
*  The expression for this is 'x' years, and Melanie's age will be 3 times her present age when she is 'x' years old.  {A possible expression for this is 18x}

**4. Solve for the value of 'x'.**

* To find 'x', you need to set up an equation based on her age in 10 years and her current age


 
{The final answer is 10 years} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.
So, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.

If Kelly’s budget is $65 ? then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine the cost of each packet of chicken:**

* Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
* Cost of one pack of bacon: $10 / 5 = $2 per pack
* Cost of one pack of chicken: $2 * 2 = $4 per pack

**2. Calculate the cost of all the chicken:**

* Cost of 6 packets of chicken: $4 * 6 = $24

**3. Calculate the cost of all the strawberries:**

* Cost of 3 packs of strawberries: $4 * 3 = $12

**4. Calculate the cost of all the apples:**

* Cost of one pack of apples: $4 / 2 = $2 per pack
* Cost of 7 packs of apples: $2 * 7 = $14

**5. Calculate the total cost of all the items:**

* Total cost: $24 + $12 + $14 = $50 

**6. Determine how much money is left in Kelly's budget:**

* Kelly's initial budget: $65
* Total cost of items: $50
* Money left: $65 - $50 = $15


{The final answer is $15} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

*To solve this problem we need to do the following:* 
1. **Set up an equation** .
2. **Solve for the number of minutes for her usual concerts.** 

 


Let's break this down:

* **Step 1: Set up an equation.** 
   -  Let 'x' represent the usual concert runtime, in minutes.
   -  The final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, so it's 2x minutes.
   -  The final concert includes a 15-minute encore, so the concert run time is 65 minutes, which is 2x + 15 
   -  We can write the equation: 2x + 15 = 65


* **Step 2: Solve for the number of minutes for her usual concerts.**
   - Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 50
   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

{The final answer is 25 minutes}<end_of_turn><eos>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

Here's how we can figure this out:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys given away.**

* Argo gave away 40 toys + 80 toys + 30 toys = 150 toys 

**Step 2: Subtract the number of toys given away from his original number.**

* Argo's original number of toys was 200 toys.

How many pairs of microphones was he able to arrange on the stage?<end_of_turn>
*Give a detailed, step-by-step solution.*


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the number of microphones that won't find a pair:**

*  20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 10 microphones.

**2. Calculate the number of microphones that were able to be arranged in pairs:**

*  Total microphones - microphones that won’t find a pair = microphones able to be arranged in pairs
*  50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones 

**3.  Final answer:**

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of indoor plants:**

* One-fourth of 100 plants = (1/4) * 100 = 25 indoor plants

**2. Calculate the number of plants remaining after removing indoor plants:**

* Plants remaining = 100 - 25 = 75 plants

**3. Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**

* Two-thirds of the remaining plants = (2/3) * 75 = 50 outdoor plants

**4. Calculate the number of flowering plants:** 

*  Flowering plants = 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants

**5.  Calculate the percent of flowering plants:** 

*  (25 flowering plants / 100 total plants) * 100% = 25%


 {The final answer is 25% }

Here's the step-by-step problem-solving process:

**1. Define the relationship:**

*  We know the whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob.
*  A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. 


**2. Set up variables:**

* Let `x` be the speed of the thingamabob in meters per second.
* The whirligig spins 5 times the speed of a thingamabob, so the whirligig's speed is `5x` meters per second.
* The whatchamacallit spins 11 times the speed of a thingamabob, so the whatchamacallit's speed is `11x` meters per second. 

**3. Utilize the information:**

* We know the whatchamacallit's speed is 121 meters per second: `11x = 121`

**4. Solve for x** 

*  Divide both sides of the equation by 11: `x = 121/11`
*  Therefore: `x = 11` meters per second. 

**5. Calculate the whirligig's speed:** 

* The whirligig spins 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, so its speed is `5 * 11 = 55` meters per second.


**6. The Final Answer:** 

The whirligig spins at { 55 meters per second } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

Here is the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the yogurt.**

* The yogurt is half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt.**

* The total cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the carrots.** 

*  Ellen pays $11 total for her goods, and the salad and yogurt cost $9, so the carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.


**Step 4: Calculate the price of one carrot.**

* Ellen eats two carrots per day, so the price of one carrot is $2 / 2 = $1.

{The final answer is $1} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.

*A detailed step by step explanation is highly recommended.*

Let's break down this problem, step by step.

**Step 1:  Define Variables**

* Let `m` represent the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
* Let `t` represent the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
* Let `l` represent the number of times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn.


**Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information**

* **First Week:** Tasha mowed Joe's lawn `m` times, and Kamala's lawn `t` times. We know that the first week Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many time as Joe's, so `t = 3m`.
* **Second Week:** Tasha mowed Joe's lawn `m` times, and Alba's lawn `l` times. We know that the second week Tasha mowed Alba's lawn five times as many as Joe's, so `l = 5m`.
* **Earnings:** Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work.


**Step 3: Find the Number of Times Tasha Mowed Each Yard**

*  We're looking to find the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn, Kamala's lawn, and Alba's lawn.


**Step 4: Solve for the Total Earnings**


{The final answer is} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars

**Solution**
1. **Find Carl’s weight:**
   - Martin’s weight is 55 kg.
   - Carl’s weight is 16 kg more than Martin’s.
   - Therefore, Carl’s weight is 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg.

2. **Find Christian's weight:**
   - Christian’s weight is 8 kg more than Carl’s weight.
   - Therefore, Christian’s weight is 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg.

3. **Find Harry's weight:**
   - Harry is 5 kg less than Christian’s weight. 
   - Therefore, Harry's weight is 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

**The final answer is 74 kg** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Carl’s weight is 55 + 16 = <<55+16=71>>71 kg.
Christian’s weight is 71 + 8 = <<71+8=79>>79 kg.
So, Harry’s weight is 79 - 5 = <<79-5=74>>74 kg.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from car rental**
* He rents the car 10 times a month.
* Each rental session lasts 3 hours.
* Earnings per hour = $25
* Earnings per session = $25/hour * 3 hours = $75
* Monthly earnings = $75/session * 10 sessions = $750

**Step 2: Calculate total expenses**
* Car payment = $500

**Step 3: Determine profit**
* Profit = Monthly earnings - Total expenses
* Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

{The final answer is $250} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month
So he makes 25*30=$<<25*30=750>>750 a month

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1.  Find the initial number of notebooks Joseph had.**

*   We know Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, and Martha started with 7.
*   This means Joseph began with 3 * 7 = 21 notebooks.

**2. Compare the number of notebooks Martha now has with Joseph's initial number.**

*   Martha now has 7 notebooks.
*   Joseph started with 21 notebooks.
*  Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 21 notebooks.


**3.  Calculate the difference between Martha's new number and Joseph's starting number.**

*   Difference = Martha's new number - Joseph's starting number
*   Difference = 7 - 21
*   Difference = -14


**Answer:** {The final answer is -14}

   * Anis rowed 1/5 * 50 miles, which equals 10 more miles than Dijana

**2.  Calculate Anis's total distance:**

* Anis rowed for 50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

**3. Calculate the total distance rowed by Dijana and Anis:**
 
* Dijana's distance + Anis's distance = total distance

If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, how many times will each child be able to have ; a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Determine the Total Available Soup:**

* Calvin has enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.  
* Since he has a pot with enough soup for four adult's bowls, we know that the amount of soup available is enough for four servings. 

**2. Determine the Number of Adults:**

* We are told Calvin is an adult.
* To find out how many meals are available, we need to find out how many adults are eating with Calvin.




Let me know if you would like to go through the rest of the problem. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the notebooks.**

* Cost per notebook: $1.50
* Number of notebooks: 5
* Cost of notebooks: $1.50 * 5 = $7.50

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ballpen.**

* Cost per ballpen: $0.50
* Number of ballpens: 1 
* Cost of ballpen: $0.50 * 1 = $0.50

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost.**

* Cost of notebooks: $7.50

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine the total material needed for small masks.**

* She makes 4 small masks per yard of material.
* She needs to make 20 small masks.
* So, she needs 20 * 2 = 40 yards of material. 

**2. Determine the total material needed for large masks.**

* She makes 3 large masks per yard of material.
* She needs to make 8 large masks.
* So, she needs 8 * 2.25 = 18 yards of material.

**3. Calculate the total material needed.**

*  She needs 40 yards for small masks.
*  She needs 18 yards for large masks.
*  Therefore, she needs 40 + 18 = 58 yards.


**The final answer is: 58 yards of material.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.
It takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.
For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.
In all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate work time**

* Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps. 
* Work time = Sleep time - 2 hours
* Work time = 10 hours - 2 hours
* Work time = 8 hours

**Step 2: Calculate total daily activities**

* Harold walks his dog for 1 hour.
* Total daily activities = Work time + Dog time
* Total daily activities = 8 hours + 1 hour

Here's the step by step process:

**1.  Find Duncan's age four years ago:**

*  Duncan's age now is 60.
*  Four years ago, Duncan was 60 - 4 = 56 years old.

**2. Find Adam's age four years ago:**

*  We know Duncan's age four years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago. 
*  This means Duncan's age four years ago was 2 * Adam's age four years ago. We can call this value  'd_4'.

**3. Set up an equation:**

*  We have two pieces of information:
    * Duncan's age four years ago was 56.
    * Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age four years ago.

**4.  Write the Equation:**

*  The equation becomes: d_4 = 2 * Adam's age four years ago.

**5. Solve for Adam's age four years ago:**

*  We still need Adam's age four years ago.  We can solve for Adam's age four years ago.

**6. Find Adam's age now:**

 
**7. Calculate Adam's age in 8 years:**

*  Lastly, find Adam's age in eight years.




Let me know if you'd like a more thorough explanation of any step.

* He gets paid $0.20 per package, so he earns 40 packages * $0.20/package = $8.00 per hour.

**3. Calculate his earnings for an eight-hour workday:**

*  He earns $8/hour * 8 hours = $64.00 for an eight-hour workday.


{The final answer is $64.00}<end_of_turn><eos>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.

Here's the breakdown of the answer step-by-step:

1. **Understand the relationship between the time for a standard sudoku and John's hydration rate:**
   - John drinks water every half hour. 
   - A standard Sudoku takes 45 minutes. 

2. **Establish the relationship between time taken for an extreme Sudoku and standard Sudoku:**
   -  John takes double the time to solve an extreme Sudoku.


3. **Calculate the time it takes John for an extreme Sudoku:**
    -  Extreme Sudoku takes 45 minutes * 2 = 90 minutes.

4. **Determine the number of water bottles consumed during an extreme Sudoku:** 
   - John would drink 90 minutes / 30 minutes/bottle = 3 bottles of water

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons**

* The balloons cost $0.50 for 2 balloons, so 1 balloon costs $0.50 / 2 = $0.25

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream**

* 2 tubs of ice cream cost $7/tub * 2 = $14 

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cake, balloons, and ice cream**

* Total cost = $11 (cake) + $0.25 (balloon) + $14 (ice cream) = $29.25


**Step 4:  Calculate how much money was left after buying cake, balloons, and ice cream.**

* This is the amount Julia and Nadine's mother gave each.


**Step 5:  Calculate the amount their mother gave each girl.**

*Step 1:* Let's break down the problem: 
We need to find the total number of students in all the games.

*Step 2:*  Find the number of students in volleyball: 
We know there are twice the number of tennis players in volleyball. So, if 6 students play tennis, there are 6 * 2 = 12 students playing volleyball. 

*Step 3:*  Find the total number of tennis players:
6 students play tennis.

If they bought the lollipops for $0.5 each, how much money was the class able to , raise from the profit of selling lollipops?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we find the solution:**

1. **Calculate the total profit earned per lollypop:**
   * Profit per lollypop = Selling price - Cost price  
   * Profit per lollypop = $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.30

2. **Calculate the total profit earned by each student:**
   * Total profit = Profit per lollypop * Number of lollypops sold
   * Total profit = $0.30 * 10 = $3.00

3. **Calculate the total profit earned by all the students:**
  * Total profit for all students = Total profit per student * Number of students
  * Total profit for all students = $3.00 * 30 = $90.00


 **The final answer is:** $90.00 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Find out how many slices Josh eats per day.**

* Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats 2 slices * 2 = 4 slices per day.

**Step 2: Determine the total slices eaten per day by both of them.**

* Abby eats 2 slices/day, and Josh eats 4 slices/day, so together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day. 

**Step 3: Calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last.**

*Note: This problem involves a simple concept of consistent accumulation of items with a predictable pattern.*

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the pattern:** Martha collects one shell per month.  This means the number of shells she has is based on a consistent monthly rate.
2. **Determine the total months:** Martha is 10 years old, and she started collecting at age 5. So, she collects for 10 - 5 = 5 years.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Total Time:** We are given that the sloth takes 8 hours to collect 24 berries.
2. **Trip Time:** We know the time spent for each trip down the tree (4 hours). 
3. **Number of Trips:** To determine the least number of berries per trip, we need to find the number of trips the sloth must make (total time in hours) / (time per trip).
4. **Calculations:** 
    * 8 hours (total time) / 4 hours (time per trip) = 2 trips.

**Here's the step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Calculate the initial amount of water in the tank:**
   - The tank holds half the pool's water, which is 10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons.

2. **Calculate the amount of water in the tank after 6 days:**
  - The rate of water emptying is 500 gallons per day.
  - Over 6 days, the tank loses 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

3. **Calculate the water remaining in the tank after 6 days:** 
  - The tank begins with 5000 gallons and loses 3000 gallons in 6 days
  - Therefore, there will be 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

**The final answer is 2000 gallons.**

If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons

If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the calories of a mini cinnamon roll:**

* A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
* A mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, so it has 600 calories / 3 = 200 calories.

**2. Calculate the calories of a mini blueberry muffin:**

* A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
* A mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, so it has 450 calories / 3 = 150 calories.

**3. Calculate the total calorie count for the mini cinnamon rolls:**

* Number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200
* Calories per mini cinnamon roll: 200 calories
* Total calories of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 * 200 = 40,000 calories

**4. Calculate the total calorie count for the mini blueberry muffins:**

* Number of mini blueberry muffins: 300
* Calories per mini blueberry muffin: 150 calories
* Total calories of mini blueberry muffins: 300 * 150 = 45,000 calories

**5. Calculate the total calorie count of all pastries:**

* Total calories: 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.


{The final answer is: 85,000 calories.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = <<200*200=40000>>40000 calories
Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

What is the average number of Junebugs that she ? removes per day?<end_of_turn>
*You can express your answer using a decimal. The answer should reflect an average over all days.* 

**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

1. **Calculate Tuesday and Wednesday's Junebug removals:**
   - Tuesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs
   - Wednesday: 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs

2. **Calculate the total Junebug removals for all days:**
   - Total: 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 232 Junebugs

3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   - Average = Total Junebugs / Number of Days
   - Average = 232 / 5 = 46.4


**{The final answer is 46.4}** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs
All total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs
She has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day

Here's the solution step-by-step: 

**1. Calculate the distance traveled by the bus.**

* Distance = Speed × Time
* Distance = 60 miles/hour × 5 hours
* Distance = 300 miles

**2. Calculate the distance traveled by the car.**

* Distance = Speed × Time
* Distance = 30 miles/hour × 8 hours
* Distance = 240 miles

**3. Determine the difference in distance.**

* Difference =  Distance Bus - Distance Car
* Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
* Difference = 60 miles

 


{The final answer is 60 miles.}<end_of_turn><eos>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.

Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number ; of toys . for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?<end_of_turn>
 
 Here's how I would think through this problem:

**1. Identify the Known Values:**
*  Blocks in building blocks: 31
*  Stuffed animals in the bin: 8
*  Rings on the stacking tower: 9
*  Total toys: 62


**2. Determine the Unknown Value:**
*  Bouncy balls in the tube: ?

**3. Develop a Plan:**
We know the total number of toys is 62 and that we know the number of the other toys. We can use the total number of toys and subtract the values of the other toys to help find the number of bouncy balls.


**4. Solve for the Unknown:** 
 * We need a way to represent these values. We can use subtraction.

* 62 – 31 – 8 – 9 = ?


**5. Find the Answer:**
 
* 62 - 31 - 8 - 9 = 14

{The final answer is 14} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

**Steps:**

1. **Set up variables:**
   * Let *P* represent the age of Peter.
   * Let *J* represent the age of John.
   * Let *P_1* represent the age of Paul.

2. **Formulate equations based on the given information:**
   *  Equation 1: *P + J + P_1 = 100* (The combined age of the three is 100).
   * Equation 2: *P_1 = J + 10* (Paul is 10 years older than John).
   * Equation 3: *P = P_1 + J*  (Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age).

3. **Solve for Peter's age (P):**
   *  Substitute the value of *P_1* and *P* from Equations 2,3 into Equation 1 

   




<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters each. If Craig's brother ? has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds.<end_of_turn>
*Note: You are to focus on the reasoning behind each step*

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understand the Information**

*  Craig spells out 20 words of 15 letters each. 
*  Craig's brother spells out words with 50 more letters than Craig.

**2.  Determine the Number of Letters Craig's brother spells**

* We know Craig has spelled 20 words of 15 letters each, 
* This means Craig has spelled 15 * 20 = 300 letters.
* Craig's brother spells out more letters than Craig and has 50 more 

**3.  Calculate the total number of letters**


Let me know if you need help with any further breakdown or clarification. 



{The final answer is 450} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.
Since Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.
The brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.

The teacher gives ! each student 2 bottles of apple juice to drink for lunch. After redeeming all her . coupons . and giving , each student : their apple juice lunch, how many bottles of apple juice does ! the teacher have for herself?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles redeemed:** 
   * The teacher has 9 coupons.
   * Each coupon provides 100 bottles.
   * Total bottles redeemed: 9 coupons * 100 bottles/coupon = 900 bottles.
 
2. **Calculate the total number of bottles given to each pupil:**
   * Each pupil gets 2 bottles.
   * Total bottles given to pupils: 2 bottles/pupil * 29 pupils = 58 bottles.

3. **Calculate the number of bottles remaining:**
   * Total bottles redeemed: 900 bottles 
   * Bottles given to pupils: 58 bottles
   * Bottles remaining: 900 bottles - 58 bottles = 842 bottles

4. **Determine the amount of bottles the teacher kept for herself.** 
   * Total bottles remaining: 842 bottles

**Here's how we solve this problem step by step:**

1. **Labor cost:** 
   *  The problem states that Patty charges $35 per hour for labor.
   *  We need to calculate the labor cost for the 2.25 hours.
      * Labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours = $78.75

2. **Total charge:**
   *  Add the labor cost, plus the parts cost to the service fee.
      * Total charge = $40 (service fee) + $78.75 (labor) + $60 (parts) = $178.75

**The final answer is: $178.75**

**Step 1:** Calculate the total cost of the CDs before the discount. 
* Cost of one CD: $15
* Number of CDs: 10
* Total cost before discount: 10 * $15 = $150

**Step 2:** Calculate the amount of the discount.
* Discount percentage: 40%
* Total cost before discount: $150
* Discount amount: 40% of $150 = 0.40 * $150 = $60

**Step 3:** Calculate the price of the CDs after the discount.
* Total cost before discount: $150
* Discount amount: $60
* Price per CD after discount: $150 - $60 = $90

**Step 4:** Calculate the number of CDs remaining after the sale. 
* Number of CDs: 10
* CDs sold: 5
* CDs remaining: 10 - 5 = 5

**Step 5:** Calculate the revenue from the remaining CDs.

Here is how to figure out how much Jen will earn:

**1. Calculate the earnings from yams:**
   *  Price per yam: $1.50
   *  Number of yams: 6
   *  Earnings from yams: $1.50 * 6 = $9.00

**2. Calculate the earnings from sweet potatoes:**
   * Price per sweet potato: $2.00
   * Number of sweet potatoes: 10
   * Earnings from sweet potatoes: $2.00 * 10 = $20.00

**3. Calculate  the earnings from carrots:**
    * Price per carrot: $1.25
    * Number of carrots: 4
    * Earnings from carrots: $1.25 * 4 = $5.00

**4.  Calculate the total earnings:** 
   * Total earnings: $9.00 + $20.00 + $5.00 = $34.00

{The final answer is $34.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.
She can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.

After that, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time.  He then finishes the remaining distance while going half the speed.  ; How long did . it take him to get across the lake?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.**

*  He swims 60% of 20 miles, which is  0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles.

**Step 2: Determine the time spent swimming.**

*  Time = Distance / Speed
*  Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the rest time.**

*  Rest time = Half the swimming time
*  Rest time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

**Step 4: Determine the distance James needs to swim after the rest.**

*  Distance = 20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

**Step 5: Calculate the time spent swimming the remaining distance at half speed.**

*  Time = Distance / Speed
*  Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the total time.**

*  Total time = Rest time + Swimming time after the rest + Remaining distance time 
*  Total time = 3 hours + 6 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

**The final answer is 17 hours.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.

*provide a detailed response*

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine Deanna's Age**

*  We know Deanna is 26 years old.

**2. Find Marcus's Age**

*  Marcus is half of Leo's age, so we can represent Marcus's age as half of Leo's. 
*  Let's use an unknown variable, 'L', to represent Leo's age. 

**3. Express Marcus's Age**

*  Marcus's age is half of Leo's age, therefore, Marcus's age is L/2.
 

 **4.  Set Up the Equation**

*  We know Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
*  Formulate the equation:  L/2 = Deanna's Age - 5 {This is our equation, where L is Leo's age}.

**5. Substitute and Solve for Leo's Age**

*  Since Deanna is 26, we can now substitute her age into our equation:  L/2 = 26 - 5
*   Simplify: L/2 = 21 
*   Multiply both sides by 2: L = 42



**Final answer: Leo is 42 years old.**<end_of_turn><eos>","Marcus is 26 - 5 = <<26-5=21>>21 years old.
Thus, Leo is 21 * 2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  represent the number of points Azibo scored.

**2. Set up Equations based on Given Information:**

* Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo:  Bahati = Azibo + 20
* Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar:  Bahati = Dinar + 10
* The team scored a total of 45 points: Bahati + Azibo + Dinar = 45


**3. Solve for Azibo's score:**

* **Substitute the first equation into the third equation:**  (Azibo + 20) + Azibo + Dinar = 45
* **Simplify:** 2 Azibo + Dinar + 20 = 45
* **Isolate Dinar:** Dinar = 45 - 2 Azibo - 20
* **Substitute the second equation:** 2 Azibo + Dinar = Bahati
 

**4. Solve for Azibo's score (using the steps above)**



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
* We are given that the book's paper is printed on both sides.
* Each paper is 100 pages per inch when stacked.
* The book is 1.5 inches thick.

**Step 2: Analyze the Setup**
* We need to find the total number of pages in the book.
* The number of pages per inch is given, but we need to consider the paper's thickness.


**Step 3: Formulate a Mathematical Relationship**
* We have two values related to the thickness of the paper: 
    * Total pages per inch:  100
    * Thickness: 1.5 inches

**Step 4: Solve for the Number of Pages**
* We can't directly find the total number of pages by just looking at the thickness.  
* To solve, we need to factor in the number of pages on each side.


**Step 5: Final Calculation**
 * To find the total number of pages, we will multiply the number of pages per inch by the number of times the paper is stacked, which is also the number of sides.

{The final answer is 1500 pages.}

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Determine the Number of Time Intervals**

*  We need to find the number of 15-minute intervals that fall within the time period of 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.
*  This is a straightforward calculation. There are 11 hours from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.
*  Each hour has 60 minutes, so there are 11 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 660 minutes 
*  Divide this by the time interval, 15 minutes, to find the number of intervals. 660 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 44 intervals

**Step 2: Calculate Reports Stapled per Interval**

* For each interval (15 minutes), Vince can staple 30 reports.


**Step 3: Calculate Total Reports Stapled**

* To find the total number of reports, multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval. 
* Total reports = 44 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1320 reports


**The final answer is: 1320 reports** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).
From 8am - 11am, there are 11 - 8 = <<11-8=3>>3 hours.
In 3 hours, there are 3 x 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 (15 minutes).
In those 3 hours, Vince stapled 12 x 30 = <<12*30=360>>360 reports.

One day, after reviewing the . cameras, she finds that she woke ! up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  : Also, that day ? she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her : bed that day?<end_of_turn>
<eos>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.
Until 12 p.m. or 24 hours, Kim slept 24 - 22 = <<24-22=2>>2 hours.
In total, Kim usually sleeps 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 hours a day.
In minutes, Kim usually sleeps 8 * 60 = <<8*60=480>>480 minutes
Kim was sleepwalking for a total of 38 - 15 = <<38-15=23>>23 minutes.
Within her usual sleep routine, Kim was sleepwalking or awake a total of 23 + 5 =<<23+5=28>>28 minutes.
On that day, Kim slept in her bed for 480 - 28 = <<480-28=452>>452 minutes.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Figure out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has:**

*   **Step 1:** Begin by figuring out the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has based on the number of measuring cups he has. 
*   **Step 2:** Convert the number of cups to the number of spoons. 
 
**2. Include the number of spoons Jonathan has left:**

*   **Step 3:** Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has left after gifting some to Pedro
  
**3. The final answer is:**


 let me know if you need to complete any of these steps
<end_of_turn><eos>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

Here's the solution:

**Step 1: Find the number of occupied beds.**

* Multiply the total capacity by the occupancy rate: 1000 beds * (1/5) = 200 occupied beds

**Step 2: Identify the number of unoccupied beds.**

* Subtract the occupied beds from the total capacity: 1000 beds - 200 beds = 800 unoccupied beds

**Step 3: Calculate the number of occupied beds over two weeks.**

* Multiply the number of occupied beds by the number of days: 200 beds/day * 14 days = 2800 occupied beds

**Step 4: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after two weeks.**

* Use the same formula as before: 800 unoccupied beds




**Step 5:  State the final answer.**
{The final answer is 800 unoccupied beds} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Find the number of non-work emails.**

*  Start with the total emails: 16 emails.
*  Subtract the work emails: 16 - 7 = 9 emails.

**Step 2: Find the number of emails to family.**

*  Two-thirds of the remaining emails are to family: (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails.

**Step 3: Find the number of emails to her boyfriend.**

*  One-third of the remaining emails are to her boyfriend: (1/3) * 9 = 3 emails.



**Step 4: Find the number of emails to her boyfriend**

*  Total emails to boyfriend: 3 emails. 




{The final answer is 3}<end_of_turn><eos>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

However, Kelly went to the same concert and said that Courtney had made the mistake of overstating the number . of people in attendance by ; 20%. If Kelly was right, how many people really attended the concert?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the overstated number:**

*  20% of 48 is (20/100) * 48 = 9.6 people. 
 
**2. Determine the corrected number:**

* The original announced number is 48, and Kelly states it was overstated by 20%. So, the corrected number is 48 - 9.6 = 38.4

 

**3.  Interpret the Result**
 
* The corrected number should be shown as a whole number .

**The final answer is: 38**


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

{The final answer is}


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* The coach brought a bag of basketballs and asked three boys (Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey) to collect them.
* The problem wants us to calculate the number of balls the coach initially brought.

**2. Work Backwards**

* We have the information that Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey. 
* This implies that Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason.


**3. Setting up the Variables**

* Let's use variables to track the number of balls:
    *  J: Number of balls Jordan carried 
    *  J': Number of balls Jason carried 
    *  Jeff: Number of balls Jeffrey carried
    *  B: Total number of balls brought to practice

**4.  Deduction**

* Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so J = 2*Jeff
* We know Jason carried 2 balls, and we can also assume Jason carried the same number as Jeffrey.


**5. Putting it All Together** 

To reach the final answer, we need to consider all this information. 



Let me know if you'd like me to work through any of the previous steps in more detail. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, Jordan carried 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 balls.
Since Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 ball.
In total, the three boys carried 4+2+1=<<4+2+1=7>>7 balls, which were all the balls the coach brought to practice.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and how to solve it:

**Step 1: Calculate the total holes dug after the first three days.**

* Holes dug day 1: 10
* Holes dug day 2: 13
* Holes dug day 3: 8
* Total holes dug: 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes


**Step 2: Find the number of holes on the final day**

*  The island had four times as many holes as the end of day 1.
*  This means the final day holes were 4 * 10 = 40 holes.
 
 


**Answer:**  {The final answer is 31 holes} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.

4. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**
    * (100%+50%) * $400 = $400 + $200 = $600

5. **Solve for travel cost:** 
    * The cost of tickets is $600

What is ! the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?<end_of_turn>


**Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem:**

1. **Break down the journey into segments:**
   -  Segment 1: Southwards flight (10 hours, 30 mph).
   -  Segment 2: Northwards flight (2 hours, 18 mph).
   -  Segment 3: Southwards flight (5 hours, 22 mph). 

2. **Determine the distance covered in each segment:** 
   - **Segment 1**:  Distance (miles) = Speed x Time 
     = 30 mph x 10 hours = 300 miles 
   - **Segment 2**: Distance (miles) = Speed x Time
     = 18 mph x 2 hours = 36 miles
   - **Segment 3**: Distance (miles) = Speed x Time
     = 22 mph x 5 hours = 110 miles

3. **Calculate the total distance travelled:**
   - Total Distance = Distance (Segment 1) + Distance (Segment 2) + Distance (Segment 3) 
   - Total Distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles.


4. **What was the bird's final position?**
   - The bird reached her winter home in the South after the flight.

**{The final answer is 446 miles}**

During the party, 1 1/2 : dozen brownies were eaten.  How many individual brownies did Greta have left over from the entire : day?<end_of_turn>
*Step 1: Determine the total number of brownies made.*

*Step 2: Determine the number of brownies sent home.*

*Step 3: Determine the total number of brownies received.*

*Step 4: Determine the total number of brownies eaten.*

*Step 5: Calculate the number of brownies left over.*


Let’s solve this step-by-step:
 *Step 1: Determine the total number of brownies made.*

Greta made a batch of brownies for herself and one dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. To calculate the total, we add the number of brownies for herself and the dozen of cream cheese swirls. 
  *Answer: Greta made a batch of 1 and cream cheese swirl brownies for a total of 1 + 12 =13 brownies.*

 *Step 2: Determine the number of brownies sent home.*

 Greta was sent home with ½ a dozen brownies. A dozen has 12 brownies, so ½ a dozen is 6 brownies. 
  *Answer: Greta sent home 6 brownies.*

 *Step 3: Determine the total number of brownies received.*

 Greta received 4 dozen brownies from her friends at the surprise party. A dozen has 12 brownies, so 4 dozen is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.
 *Answer: Greta had 48 brownies at the party.*

 *Step 4: Determine the total number of brownies eaten.*

 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  A dozen has 12 brownies, so 1 1/2 dozen is 1 1/2 * 12 = 18 brownies.
 *Answer: 18 brownies were eaten.*


 *Step 5: Calculate the number of brownies left over.*

 We calculate the total brownies made minus the brownies sent home, the brownies received, and the brownies eaten. 
 *Answer: The number of brownies left over is 13 - 6 + 48 - 18 = 38 brownies. *




{The final answer is 38} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the brother's age:**

* Nani's brother is twice her age, so the brother's age is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.

**2. Calculate the sister's age:**

* Nani's sister is 25% younger than the brother. 
* 25% of the brother's age is 16 * 0.25 = 4 years.
*  The sister's age is 16 + 4 = 20 years old.

**3. Find the total age of all three:**

* Total age is Nani's age + brother's age + sister's age 
* Total age is 8 + 16 + 20 = 44 years old.


 **The final answer is 44.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.
That means she is 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.
In total all mentioned family members, are 16 + 6 + 8 = <<16+6+8=30>>30 years old.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Calculating the number of jobs for each type of string:**

*   Synthetic Gut: 3 racquets
*   Polyester: 5 racquets
*   Hybrid: 4 racquets

**2.  Computing the total time for each type of string:**

*   Synthetic Gut: 3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
*   Polyester: 5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
*   Hybrid: 4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes 

**3.  Adding up the total time for all stringing types:**
 


{The final answer is 150 minutes} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.
He is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.
He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the number of players on Zeke's team.**

*  Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, who have 13 players. 
* So, Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.

**2. Calculate the combined number of players.**

*  To find the total number of players, we add the number of players on Zeke's team and Carlton's team.
*  Therefore, the combined number of players is 20 + 13 = 33.

* The perimeter is the total length of all sides added together.
*  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
*  Perimeter = 2 * (15 feet + 10 feet)
*  Perimeter = 2 * (25 feet)
*  Perimeter = 50 feet

**2. Calculate wood slats needed:**

* Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing.
*  Number of slats = Perimeter * slats per foot 
*  Number of slats = 50 feet * 2 slats/foot
*  Number of slats = 100 slats

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate oranges given to others:** 
    * Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and sister 2 boxes each, so she gave away 2 * 2 = 4 boxes of oranges. 

2. **Calculate oranges remaining:**
    *  She started with 12 boxes and gave away 4 boxes, so she had 12 - 4 = 8 boxes of oranges remaining.

3. **Calculate oranges kept:**
    * Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges, so she kept (1/4) * 8 = 2 boxes of oranges.

4. **Calculate oranges sold:**
    *  She had 8 boxes - 2 boxes = 6 boxes of oranges left.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the price of the red car:**

* The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, meaning it costs 100% - 40% = 60% of the blue car's price.
*  Price of the red car = 60% of $100 = (0.60) * $100 = $60.

**2. Calculate the total cost:**

*  The total cost of both cars is the price of the blue car plus the price of the red car.
*  Total cost = $100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160 


 **The final answer is $160** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Friday's catch:**

* Joe caught 4 times his Thursday's catch, so he caught 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds of crawfish on Friday.

**2. Saturday's catch:**

* He caught half the amount from Friday, so he caught 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds of crawfish on Saturday.

**3. Total catch:**

*  Over the three days, Joe caught 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds of crawfish.

**4. Servings:**

* Each serving requires 3 pounds of crawfish, so he has 21 pounds / 3 pounds/serving = 7 servings.

 
{The final answer is 7 servings} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of the 12 pounds he caught on Friday so he caught 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds
In three days he has caught 3+12+6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish
3 pounds is a serving and he caught 21 pounds so he has 21/3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish

**Solution:**

1. **Peel Time:** Determine how long it takes Emily to peel a set of shrimp: 
   - She can peel 6 shrimp per minute. 
   - Therefore, it will take her 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes to peel the shrimp.

2. **Cook Time:** Determine how long it takes Emily to cook a set of shrimp:
   - She can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 
   -  Therefore, it will take her 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/minute = 3 minutes to cook the shrimp.

3. **Total Time:** Add the peel time and cook time together:

   - Total time = 15 minutes (peel) + 3 minutes (cook) = 18 minutes




**Final answer: It will take Emily 18 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Temperature:**  
   - We need the starting temperature of the room. The problem says the room will warm up at 2 degrees/hour without an air conditioner.
2. **Low Setting Cooling:**
   - The room cools 2 degrees per hour on Low. Over 3 hours: 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees lower.
3. **High Setting Cooling:**
   - The room cools 3 degrees per hour on high. Over 4 hours: 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees lower. 
4. **Total Cooling:**
   - The combined cooling is 6 degrees + 12 degrees = 18 degrees.
5. **Final Temperature:**
   - The temperature decreased by 18 degrees. 
6. **Final Answer:** {The final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature}. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

How many flights to France . does the first plane take in one day?<end_of_turn>
*Here's how we can break down this problem step by step:*


**1. Understanding the First Plane**
   * The first plane makes three-quarters of its flights to Greece. Let's say 'x' represents the total number of flights for the first plane.
   * This means the first plane makes 0.75x flights to Greece. 
   * The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The total number of these remaining flights is (1-0.75x).

**2. Understanding the Second Plane**
   * The second plane flies exclusively to Poland.
   * This means, the second plane makes 0.5 * x flights to Poland


**3. Relating the Numbers**
   * We know the number of flights for the first plane is 0.5x. 
   * We know the number of flights for the second plane is 0.5x.

**4. Solving for Number of Flights to France**
  
**5. Final Answer**

{The final answer is}



<end_of_turn><eos>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

* Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, who howls for 20 seconds.
* Chikote's howl duration: 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds.

**2. Calculate the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote.**

*  Tobias’ howl duration: 20 seconds
* Chikote’s howl duration: 40 seconds
* Combined duration: 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

**3. Find the duration of Igneous's howl.** 

* Igneous howls for the same time as Tobias and Chikote combined.
* Igneous's howl duration: 60 seconds.

**4. Determine the total combined howl duration.**

* Tobias' howl duration: 20 seconds
* Chikote's howl duration: 40 seconds 
* Igneous's howl duration: 60 seconds
* Combined duration: 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

**5. Convert the total howl duration into minutes.**

*  There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. 
* Total time in minutes: 120 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 2 minutes.       



{The final answer is 2 minutes} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Find the amount his father gave:**
   * His father gave him twice the amount his mother gave.
   *  Twice the mother's gift is 6 * 2 = $12.

**2. Find the total amount from his mother and father:**
   * The mother's gift + the father's gift = Total from his parents.
   * $6 + $12 = $18

**3. Find the total money from his mother and father and him:**
   * Total from parents + his money from savings = Total money.
   * $18 + $30 = $48

**4. Find the amount Adam contributed from his savings**
   * Total money - gifts from parents and mother = His contribution
   * $48 - $30 = $18



{The final answer is $18}<end_of_turn><eos>","Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

{The final answer is}

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the average age.**

* First, find the average age of the four children. To do this we use the given information: 
 The total age of the group is 20.
* The average age of the group is $(20)$ / $(4) = 5$ years old.


**2. Calculate Helene's age: **

* Helene is twice as old as the average age, so her age is $2 \times 5 = 10$ years old.


**3. Find Wilfred's age:** 

* We know the age of Akbar and Alessandro and know the total age of all the children, so we can use this information to find the age of Wilfred.




Let me know if you'd like to see any specific steps worked out in a bit more detail. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

*Answer this question step by step.*



Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Calculate the total number of cookies:**

* 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

**2. Determine the number of cookies given to the church:**

* 1500 cookies * (1/2) = 750 cookies

**Here's how we can break down this problem**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the size of a slice for a kid. 

2. **Determine the Size of an Adult's Slice:**
   *  An adult's slice is twice the size of a kid's slice, so the adult's slice size is '2x'.

3. **Calculate the Total Watermelon:**
   * There are 6 people so we will need to find the total watermelon. We will use these steps to calculate a proportion of the watermelon:


4. **Determine the Percentage of Watermelon for Each Adult:**
   *  Divide the size of an adult's slice by the total watermelon size and express the answer as a percentage.

**Final Answer:**


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

How many hours will Doctor Jones have left to update his records if he has 9 inpatients at the clinic?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the problem and the solution:

**Step 1:  Calculate the time for patient rounds.**

* He visits 10 inpatients.
* Each visit takes 20 minutes.
* Total time for rounds: 10 inpatients * 20 minutes/inpatient = 200 minutes

**Step 2:  Calculate the total time spent on appointments.**

* Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
* Total appointment time: 10 appointments * 30 minutes/appointment = 300 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent**

* Total time for rounds: 200 minutes
* Total time for appointments: 300 minutes 
* Total time: 200 minutes + 300 minutes = 500 minutes

**Step 4: Convert minutes to hours.**

* There are 60 minutes in one hour.
* Total time in hours: 500 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8.33 hours.


**Step 5:  Calculate remaining time.**

* Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients at the clinic.
 



{The final answer is 8.33 hours}<end_of_turn><eos>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Understand the Given Information**

* Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
* Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
* They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.

**Step 2:  Convert the Quantities to Match the Same Units**

*  Lisa's boxes are in a common unit with Peter's boxes, so the initial word units are sufficient.

**Step 3:  Set Up an Equation**

* The number of chocolate bars Lisa sold is equal to Lisa's boxes * chocolate bar per box
* The number of chocolate bars Peter sold is equal to Peter's boxes * chocolate bar per box.
* The total number of chocolate bars is the sum of the number of bars by Lisa and the number of bars by Peter.

**Let's write an equation about the total number of chocolate bars:**

 3.5 boxes * chocolate bar per box + 4.5 boxes * chocolate bar per box = 64 chocolate bars

**Step 4: Simplify the Equation**

* Combine the terms.

 8 boxes * chocolate bar per box = 64 chocolate bars


**Step 5: Solve for the Chocolate Bar per Box**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 8 boxes.
 
 chocolate bar per box = 64 chocolate bars / 8 boxes

**Step 6: Calculate**
 
 chocolate bar per box = 8 chocolate bars 
 
 **Step 7:   Final Answer** 
 
 The final answer is: 8 chocolate bars. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

At present, the dance studio has ! 10 students , and is . rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of , the dance studio in a month?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the cost per student per session:**

* The cost per session is $25.
* Plus $1.50 per student per session.
* Total cost per student per session = $25 + $1.50 = $26.50

**2. Calculate the earnings per session:**

* The studio rent is $25 per session.
* The cost per session per student is $26.50
* Total earnings per session = $25 + ($26.50 * 10 student) = $25 + $265 = $290

**3. Calculate the earnings per week:**

* The studio is rented 3 days a week.
* The earnings per session are $290.
* Total earnings per week = $290 * 3 days = $870

**4. Calculate the earnings per month:**

How much will it cost to fill the pool?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool**

* The volume of a rectangular prism (like a swimming pool) is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth.
*  Volume = Length × Width × Depth
*  Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet 
*  Volume = 1400 cubic feet

**Step 2: Convert Cubic Feet to Gallons**

* 1 cubic foot equals 7.43 gallons
*  Volume in gallons = Volume in cubic feet × 7.43 gallons/cubic foot
*  Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 7.43 gallons/cubic foot
*  Volume in gallons = 10302 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the Cost of the Pool Fill**

* Cost per gallon is $0.10
*  Total cost = Volume in gallons × Cost per gallon
*  Total cost = 10302 gallons × $0.10/gallon
*  Total cost = $1030.20


{The final answer is $1030.20} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

How many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the problem and steps to solve it:

**Step 1:  Calculate Wanda's first-day water pumping.** 

* Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank = (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons.

**Step 2: Calculate Ms. B's first-day water pumping.**

* Ms. B pumped 3/4 of Wanda's amount = (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

**Step 3: Calculate the total water pumped on the first day.**

* Total pumped by Wanda and Ms. B = Wanda's pumping + Ms. B's pumping 
* = 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons = 7875 gallons

**Step 4: Calculate Wanda's second-day water pumping.**

* Wanda pumped 2/3 of the first-day amount 
* = (2/3) * 7875 gallons = 5250 gallons.

**Step 5: Calculate Ms. B's second-day water pumping.**

* Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the first-day amount
* = (1/3) * 7875 gallons = 2625 gallons.

**Step 6: Calculate the total water pumped in two days.**

* Total pumped by Wanda and Ms. B = Wanda's second-day pumping + Ms. B's second-day pumping
* = 5250 gallons + 2625 gallons = 7875 gallons

**Step 7: Calculate remaining water needed.**

* Remaining water = Total tank capacity - Total pumped
* = 18000 gallons - 7875 gallons 
* = 10125 gallons.




{The final answer is 10125 gallons.}<end_of_turn><eos>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

In , the end, the charge remaining was 28%. What was the charge ? of the power bank when Maria went ; out to the park?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:

**1. Understanding the information**

* **Initial charge:**  We don't know the initial charge, but we'll mark it as 'x'.
* **Power loss rate:**  The power bank loses 9% of charge every hour initially, then 7% every hour for three hours.
* **Remaining charge:** The final charge after all the losses is 28%.

**2.  Establishing equations and variables**

Let's use variables to represent different stages of the power bank's charge:

*  'x': The initial charge
*  'y': The charge after the first 5 hours (with the 9% loss rate)
*  'z': The charge after the next 3 hours (with the 7% loss rate)


**3. Step-by-step calculation of the power bank's charge**
* **Step 1: Initial Charge (x):** We don't know the initial charge, but it is given as 'x'.
* **Step 2: Loss after 5 hours:** 9% of the initial charge (x) is lost after 5 hours. 
     * To determine the charge after 5 hours, we need to set up the equation: 
     * y = x - (0.09x) 
* **Step 3: Loss after next 3 hours:** 7% of the charge at the end of 5 hours (y) is lost for the next 3 hours.
     *  z = y - (0.07y)

**4. Finding the Initial Charge (x)** 

* Finally, to get the initial charge (x), we need to consider these factors

 


**5. Final answer** 
{The final answer is}


<end_of_turn><eos>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate Janet's daily earning:**
   - Hourly wage: $10
   - Daily Earnings: $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week

2. **Calculate Janet's weekly earnings from tips:**
   - Daily Tip: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week
  
3. **Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings:**
   - Total Weekly Earnings: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

4. **Calculate the amount needed for the car down payment:**
   -  20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

5. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save the down payment:**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sweets.**

* Anne kept two packs, so she has 15 - 2 = 13 packs remaining.
* Each pack has 60 pieces. 
* Total pieces: 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces

**Step 2: Determine the number of pieces per friend.**

(Round ; to the nearest integer)<end_of_turn>
 
Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the price increase after the first year.**

*  Increase = 5% of $120 
*  Increase = (5/100) * $120 = $6

**Step 2:  Calculate the price after the first year.**

* Price after year 1 = Original price + Increase 
* Price after year 1 = $120 + $6 = $126

**Step 3: Calculate the price increase after the second year.**

* Increase = 5% of $126 
* Increase = (5/100) * $126 = $6.3

**Step 4: Calculate the price after the second year.**

* Price after year 2 = Price after year 1 + Increase
* Price after year 2 = $126 + $6.3 = $132.3

**Step 5: Calculate the price increase after the third year.**

* Increase = 5% of $132.3 
* Increase = (5/100) * $132.3 = $6.62


**Step 6: Calculate the price after the third year.**

 * Price after year 3 = Price after year 2 + Increase 
 * Price after year 3 = $132.3 + $6.62 = $138.92

 **Final Answer is: $139** 




<end_of_turn><eos>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6
After 3 years, the price of carrots will increase by $6*3 = $<<6*3=18>>18

If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, and half of the average and difficult questions correctly, how many points is she sure to get?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of how to approach the question:

**1. Calculate the number of easy questions:**

*  40% of 60 items = (40/100) * 60 = 24 easy questions

**2. Calculate the number of average and difficult questions:**

* 60 total items - 24 easy questions = 36 questions left to distribute
* 36 questions / 2 = 18 average and difficult questions

**3. Calculate Aries's score on easy questions:**

* Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correctly.
* Score on easy questions = (75/100) * 24 = 18 points

**4. Calculate Aries's score on average and difficult questions:**

* She gets half of the average and difficult questions right, meaning she's sure to get 50% of these. 
* Score on average and difficult questions = (50/100) * 18 = 9 points


**5. Calculate Aries's total score:**

* Total score = Score on easy questions + Score on average and difficult questions
* Total score = 18 points + 9 points = 27 points {The final answer is 27} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.
There are 60 questions x 40/100 = <<60*40/100=24>>24 easy questions.
There are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.
If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 18 points + 18 points = <<18+18=36>>36 points in her quiz.

Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. How many small stuffed animals did she sell?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine the price of a large stuffed animal:**

*  Teresa sells large stuffed animals three times the price of small ones.
*  Therefore, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.

**2. Determine the number of large stuffed animals sold:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. 
*  She sold twice as many small as large, meaning she sold 2x small stuffed animals.
*  She earned $120, so the total earnings from the large and small stuffed animals is 120. We can represent this with an equation.

**3. Formulate the mathematical equation:**

*  The earnings from the small animals are equal to 4 * 2x 
*  The earnings from large animals are equal to $12 * x
*  The total earnings equation is: 4 * 2x + $12 * x = $120

**4. Solve for x:**

*  Simplify the equation: 8x + 12x = $120
*  Combine like terms: 20x = $120
*  Divide both sides by 20: x = 6

 


**Answer: {The final answer is 6}** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

*Hint : use algebra*

**Solution:**

1. **Define the unknowns:**
   - Let 'x' be the number of eggs the friends found. 

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The team hid 100 eggs, and the Smith twins found 30, each, so we know that = 100 - 30 - 30 = 40 eggs were found by the other friends.

**Here's how to solve this step by step:**

**1. Calculate the ore mined with a steel pickaxe:**

* The steel pickaxe increases the mining rate by 50% of the iron pickaxe's rate. 
* 50% of 12 pounds per day = (50/100) * 12 pounds per day = 6 pounds per day more.
* Mining rate with a steel pickaxe = 12 pounds per day + 6 pounds per day = 18 pounds per day.

**2. Calculate the ore mined by each dwarf with a steel pickaxe:**

* Each dwarf mines 18 pounds per day.

**3. Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes:**

* Total ore mined per day = 18 pounds per day/dwarf * 40 dwarfs = 720 pounds per day. 
 {The final answer is}720 pounds 


 

<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day

Knowing that . the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Define the Proportionality Relationship:**

* We are told that the prices of the sandwiches are proportional.  This means that the ratio of the prices of the packages is constant and can be used to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

**2. Find the Proportionals Ratios:**

* Look at the prices for the first two packages.
* The price of the first package is $3 for 2 sandwiches, so  the ratio of price per sandwich is $3 / 2.
* The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches, so the ratio of price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = 3/2.

**3. Identify the Ratio:**

* We can use a proportion to represent the relationship in these ratios: (Price per sandwich)1 = (Price per sandwich)2
*  Our proportion is: $3 / 2 = $6 / 4



**4. Determine the Price of a Sandwich:**

* To find the price of a sandwich in the third package, we should set up the proportion from step 3.
* To solve this proportion, multiply both sides by the denominator 
* The price of one sandwich in the third package.


 
{The final answer is $12}
<end_of_turn><eos>","So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich
Now the price for the package with 8 sandwiches would be $1.5/sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $<<1.5*8=12>>12

* The amount Tom saves by selling his old bedroom is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

**Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Cost** 

* He pays 10% of the remaining cost each month. 
*  Calculate 10% of $2000: (10/100) * $2000 = $200
 


**Step 4: State the final answer** 
{The final answer is $200.} 


 
**Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.**<end_of_turn><eos>","He has to pay 3000-1000=$<<3000-1000=2000>>2000

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total time Melissa spends on jury duty.**

* Time per day: 6 hours
* Number of days: 3 days
* Total time: 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours

**2. Calculate Melissa's total earnings.**

* Total pay: $15/day * 3 days = $45

**3. Calculate Melissa's total parking expenses.**

* Cost per day: $3
* Number of days: 3 days
* Total parking expense: $3/day * 3 days = $9

 **4. Calculate Melissa's net earnings per day.**

* Total earnings: $45
* Total expenses: $9
* Net earnings per day: $45 - $9 = $36

**5. Calculate Melissa's net earnings per hour**

* Melissa worked for 18 hours
* Net earnings per hour:  $36/hour


{The final answer is $36 per hour} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day
Then divide this number by the number of hours Melissa spends in court each day to find her hourly pay: $12/day / 6 hours/day = $<<12/6=2>>2/hour

After starting at the first bottle, it will take Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy in. How many seconds total will it take Richard to set off all the soda fountains?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can figure out how long it will take:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of soda bottles Richard will place.**

* Width of the driveway = 24 feet
* Distance between bottle placements = 3 feet
* Number of soda bottles = 24 feet / 3 feet/bottle = 8 bottles

**Step 2: Calculate the time to pour all the drinks**

* It takes Richard 5 seconds to move between each bottle. 
* Total time = Number of bottles * Time per bottle
* Total time = 8 bottles * 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds.




{The final answer is 40 seconds.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.
If Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the cost of Parmesan:** 
    - The price per pound of Parmesan is $11.
    - Amor buys 0.2 pounds of Parmesan. 
    - Cost of Parmesan = $11 * 0.2 = $2.20

2. **Calculate the cost of mozzarella:**
    - The price per pound of mozzarella is $6.
    - Amor buys 3 pounds of mozzarella.
    - Cost of mozzarella = $6 * 3 = $18.

3. **Calculate Amor's total spending:**
    - Total spending = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella 
    - Total spending = $2.20 + $18 = $20.20

4. **Calculate the remaining money:**
    - Amor starts with $50.
    - Total spending is $20.20.
    - remaining money = $50 - $20.20 = $29.80 


**Final answer: {She will have $29.80 left to buy meat.}**

If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long ? would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the ; money lost , from not working while in , school.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Jim's Expected Income:**

* **Before college:** $25,000 per year
* **After college:** $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year
* **Expected income increase:** $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 

**2.  Identify Annual Costs:**

* **Loan payments:** $50,000 per year

**3.  Determine the Time it Takes to Cover Loan Payments:**

* **Total loan payments:** $50,000 per year 
* **Time to cover loan payments:**  There's not a clear way to determine this exactly, as other factors can affect finances. 

**4.  Additional Considerations:**

* **Opportunity cost:** This refers to the income he would have earned if he stayed at his job. Calculate the estimated opportunity cost.
* **Living expenses:**  He would need to factor in living costs, like rent, food, and necessary expenses.
* **Other potential sources of income:**  Does he have any part-time work, or can he take advantage of grants, scholarships, or side gigs during college?

**5.  Conclusion and Final Answer:**

To give a definitive answer to how long it would take to earn enough to cover the loans and the money lost from not working full-time, we need more information.


 
**Remember:** 

This analysis is a general framework. You could expand on this further depending on the context and specific data you have available.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the bed dimensions:**
   - Length: 6 feet
   - Width: 8 feet

2. **Calculate the fabric requirements:**
   -  Longer fabric: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet
   -  Wider fabric: 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet 
   -  The fabric needs an extra 8 feet x 10 feet.

3. **Determine the total fabric area:**
   -  Area of the larger fabric: 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.


{The final answer is 80 square feet.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet

Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate Tuesday's deliveries:**

* One-fifth of Monday's deliveries is (1/5) * 425 = 85 letters.
* They delivered 17 more than that: 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

**2. Calculate Wednesday's deliveries:**

* Twice the number of Tuesday's deliveries is 2 * 102 = 204 letters.
* They delivered 5 more than that: 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

**3. Calculate the total deliveries:**

*  Total letters delivered is Monday's deliveries + Tuesday's deliveries + Wednesday's deliveries.
*  Total letters = 425 + 102 + 209 = {636} letters.



 **Therefore, the post office delivered 636 letters on Monday - Wednesday.**<end_of_turn><eos>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the amount the first person received.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* The second person took $80, more than the first:  x + 80 
* The third person took twice what the second took: 2 * (x + 80)

**3.  Combine the known amounts:**

* The total amount divided by the number of people is their share.
* The sum of the amounts received by the first, second, and third person equals $1920: x + (x + 80) + 2 * (x + 80) = 1920

**4.  Solve for x:**


* Simplify the equation: x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
* Combine like terms: 4x + 240 = 1920
* Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680

**Here's a step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate the total work days:**
   - The team worked for 3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days 
 

2. **Calculate the total work time:**
  - They worked 3/8 of a day per day for 21 days = (3/8) * 21 = 6.75 days
  -  We need to ensure we are in hours. so, we'll convert this to hours. 

3. **Convert days to hours:**
- There are 24 hours in a day.
- 6.75 days * 24 hours/day = 162 hours

4. **Calculate hours per painter:**
- Divide the total work hours by the number of painters 
- 162 hours / 4 painters = 40.5 hours/painter

5. **Rounding Off**
Rounding off 40.5 hours/painter to the nearest hundredth, it's 40.50 hours/painter.

                    question:
                    Rory is retrieving tennis balls from the ! court after a tennis match. In the first of three sets, he had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set. In the . third set, he retrieved half : as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis . balls . in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Set up variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

**2.  Formulate equations based on the information given:**

* **First set:**  x + 4  (Rory retrieved 4 more than the second set)
* **Second set:** x 
* **Third set:** x/2  (He retrieved half as many as the second set)
* **Total:** 19 

**3.  Solve for the number of tennis balls in the second set:**

* We know that Rory retrieved 19 balls in total. 
* Combine the information from the equations: x + 4 + x + x/2 = 19

**4. Simplify the equation:**

* Combine the 'x' terms: 2x + 4 + x/2 = 19
* Simplify: 2x + 2x/2 + 4 = 19 
* Combine the 'x' terms: 2x + x + 4 = 19
* Combine terms: 3x + 4 = 19

**5. Isolate 'x':**

* Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 15
* Divide both sides by 3: x = 5

 


**6. Find the number of balls in the second set:**

*  x= 5

**7. Determine the number of balls in the first set:**

*  The first set was x + 4
* Therefore, the first set had 5 + 4 = 9 balls



**{The final answer is 9}** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

<eos>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

*Here is how to solve:

**Step 1:** Figure out the number of English books. 
   * Half of the books are in English. 
   * So, there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

**Step 2:** Figure out the number of German books.
   * 10% of the books are in German.
   * So, there are 50 * 0.10 = 5 German books.

**Step 3:** Figure out the number of English and German books. 
   * The total number of English  and German books is 25 + 5 = 30 books. 

**Step 4:**  Find the number of Spanish books.
   * The total number of books is 50.
   * The number of Spanish books is 50 - 30 = 20 books.


{The final answer is 20}

***


<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

                    Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  ; If there are 16 cups in a gallon, how many , gallons of water does she drink in 30 days?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:** 

1. **Identify the known values:**
    *  Daily water consumption: 8 cups
    *  Water in one gallon: 16 cups

2. **Determine the relationship:**
    * We want to find out the number of gallons consumed over a period of 30 days. 
 
3. **Use a conversion factor:**
    * The relationship between cups and gallons is constant. So we can calculate it by dividing daily water consumption by the number of cups in a gallon. {8 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 0.5 gallons}
4. **Calculate the total gallons over 30 days:**
    * Multiply the daily consumption rate by the number of days in the period.

    {0.5 gallons/day * 30 days = 15 gallons}.        
 
5. **Answer:**
    The final answer is 15 gallons. 

 


**Explanation:**

The problem involves calculating the total amount of water Ingrid drinks over a month (30 days). To solve this we use the rate at which she consumes water. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","She drinks 8 cups of water a day so after 30 days she drinks 8*30 = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water
There are 16 cups in 1 gallon so she drinks 240/16 = <<240/16=15>>15 gallons of water in 30 days

{The final answer is }


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. People boarded at the first stop:**

   * 20 more people boarded the train at the first stop. 
   * Total people after first stop = 120 + 20 = 140

**2. People got off at the second stop:**

   * 50 people disembarked the train.

**3. People on the train after the second stop:**

  * Twice the number of people disembarked at the second stop (50) will board.
   *  Total people = 90 + (50 * 2) = 90 + 100 = 190

**4. People got off at the third stop:**

  * 80 people disembarked the train at the third stop. 
   * Total people = 190 - 80 = 110

‌ی

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the increased cost:**

* The accident increased the cost by 60%. 
*  60% of $120 is (60/100) * $120 = $72 

**2. Calculate the new cost:**

*  The new cost is the old cost plus the increase.
*  The new cost is $120 + $72 = $192

**3. Calculate the yearly cost:**

  *  Monthly cost is $192 
  *  There are 12 months in a year.
*  Yearly cost is $192 * 12 = $2304

 **The final answer is $2304.**

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of Donovan's part in minutes.
* Betsy's part length is 'x + 18' minutes.

**2. Set up an Equation:**

* The total time for both parts must add up to 98 minutes. 
*  This means: x + (x + 18) = 98

**3. Solve for 'x':**

* Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98
* Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

**4. Calculate Betsy's Part Length:**

* Betsy's part is x + 18 minutes. 
* Substitute x = 40:  40 + 18 = 58

                    question:
                    Hannah slips on a banana peel , and breaks her arm. The doctor charges her $200 for the cast, $300/hour for a : 30-minute visit, $4/pill , for 30 , painkillers, and $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. How much does the doctor's visit cost total?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the cost of the doctor's visit:**

* The doctor's visit time is 30 minutes, which is equal to 0.5 hours.
* The cost per hour is $300/hour.
* The cost of the visit is $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.

**2. Calculate the cost of the painkillers:**

* The number of painkillers is 30.
* The cost per pill is $4/pill.
* The total cost of the painkillers is $4/pill * 30 pills = $120

**3. Calculate the parking cost:**

* The parking time is 2 hours.
* The cost per hour is $6/hour.
* The total parking cost is $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

**4. Calculate the total cost of the visit:**

* The total cost of the visit is $150 (from the doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $282


**The final answer is $282.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours
Then find the total cost of the visit: $300/hour * .5 hours = $<<300*.5=150>>150
Then find the total cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $<<4*30=120>>120
Then find the cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $<<6*2=12>>12
Then add all the different costs to find the total cost: $12 + $120 + $150 + $200 = $<<12+120+150+200=482>>482

*The problem*

**Solution**

1. **Calculate the number of emails that don't need a response.**
    * Multiply the total emails by the percentage that don't need a response: 80 emails * 0.20 = 16 emails

2. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response.**
     * Subtract the emails that don't need a response from the total emails: 80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

3. **Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a 5 day work week.**
     * Divide the number of emails requiring a response by the number of work days: 64 emails / 5 days = 12.8 emails

4. **Round the answer to the nearest whole number, if necessary** 
     * Since we're talking about emails, it's reasonable to round 12.8 down to 12 

**Final answer is:** 12


 
<end_of_turn><eos>","He gets 80*.2=<<80*.2=16>>16 emails he doesn't need to respond to
So he responds to 80-16=<<80-16=64>>64 emails
So he responds to 64*5=<<64*5=320>>320 emails a week

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of big coupons:**

* Anthony sends twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he sends 700 coupons * 2 = 1400 big coupons.

**2. Calculate the cost of mailing small coupons:**

* The cost of mailing a small coupon is $0.05.
* He needs to mail 700 small coupons at $0.05 per coupon, so his total postage cost for these would be 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $35. 

 **3. Calculate the cost of mailing big coupons:**

* The cost of mailing a big coupon is $0.15.
* He needs to mail 1400 big coupons at $0.15 per coupon, so his total postage cost for these would be 1400 coupons * $0.15/coupon = $210

So Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.  How many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Find the original number of meatball subs.**

* Sidney ordered 10 meatball sub sandwiches - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.

**Step 2: Find the total number of meatball sandwiches that were eaten.**

*  Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.

**Step 3: Find the number of additional meatball sub sandwiches.**

* Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches + 3 = 10 meatball sub sandwiches.
 

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of meatball sub sandwiches.**

*  Total meatball sub sandwiches = 7 sandwich + 10 sandwiches + 3 additional sandwiches = 20 meatball sub sandwiches. 

 **Step 5: Calculate the number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches.**

*  Number of meatballs = (Number of sandwiches) * (Number of meatballs per sandwich)
  *  Number of meatballs = 20 sandwiches * 4 meatballs per sandwich
  *  Number of meatballs = 80 meatballs
 

**The final answer is 80 Meatballs** .

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of butter needed.**

* Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants.
* He needs to make 6 dozen croissants. 
* Therefore, he needs 1 pound/dozen * 6 dozen = 6 pounds of butter.

**Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.**

* The promotion offers half-price on one pound of butter.
* This means the price is reduced by $4.00 / 2 = $2.00.

**Step 3:  Calculate the cost of the full-price butter.**

* The full price of a pound of butter is $4.00
* To find the cost of 6 pounds of butter, multiply the price per pound by the quantity.
* Cost = $4.00/pound * 6 pounds = $24.00


**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the discounted butter.**

* The discounted price per pound is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. 
* The total cost will be the discounted price, so $2.00/pound * 6 pounds = $12.00



**Step 5: Find the final solution.**
* Dennis will pay $12.00 for 6 pounds of butter.
{The final answer is $12.00.}

 Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate how much money Maggie spent.**

* Maggie spent one-quarter of her money, so she spent (1/4) * $60 = $15.

**Step 2: Calculate how much money Riza spent.**

* Riza spent one-third of her money, so she spent (1/3) * $60 = $20.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money they spent.**

* Maggie spent $15, and Riza spent $20, so together they spent $15 + $20 = $35.


**Step 4: Calculate the amount of money left.**

* They started with $60 each and spent $35 together. 
* The amount of money left is $60 - $35 = $25.


**Step 5: Repeat the calculation using Maggie's and Riza's spending together.**

* Together, they spent $35. 



**Final answer:** {The final answer is $25}<end_of_turn><eos>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total bananas consumed by the first two monkeys:**

*   The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.
*   Total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.

**2. Determine the amount of bananas left for the third monkey:**

*   Mr. Robles has 315 bananas - 24 bananas = 291 bananas left.

**3. Calculate how many bananas the third monkey eats:**

*   The third monkey eats all the remaining bananas, so it eats 291 bananas per day.

{The final answer is 291} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the roses:**

* Cost of one rose: $2 
* Number of roses: 15
* Total cost of roses: $2 * 15 = $30

**2. Calculate the total amount Jenny paid:**

* Five $5 bills = 5 * $5 = $25
* Total paid with money: $25 + $30 = $55

**3. Calculate the amount Jenny receives in change:**

* Total payment: $55
* Total cost: $30
* Change: $55 - $30 = $25

**4.  Calculate how many quarters are in $25**

* $1 = 10 cents
* $25 = $25 * 10 cents = $250 cents

*100 cents = $1


**Answer:** {The final answer is 250/100 = 2.50}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Jenny has $25 because 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25
She buys 1 dozen roses and 3 single roses because 15 - 12 - 3 = <<15-12-3=0>>0
She spends $6 on the single roses because 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6
She spends $21 on roses because 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21
She gets $4 in change because 25 - 21 = <<25-21=4>>4
She gets 16 quarters because 4 x 4 = <<4*4=16>>16

Here's how we can calculate Terry's earnings step-by-step:

**1. Milkshakes Earnings:**

*  Calculate the earnings from milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50/milkshake = $33.00 

**2. Burger Platter Earnings:**

*   Calculate the earnings from burger platters: 9 burger platters * $11/burger platter = $99.00

**3. Soda Earnings:**

* Calculate the earnings from sodas: 20 sodas * $1.50/soda = $30.00

**4. Total Earnings:**

* Add the earnings from all his products: $33.00 + $99.00 + $30.00 = $162.00


{The final answer is $162.00} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total cost of the milkshakes: 6 milkshakes * $5.50/milkshake = $<<6*5.5=33>>33

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1.  First Train:**

*  The first train arrives in 10 minutes.
*  It stays at the station for 20 minutes. 
 
**2.  Second Train:**

*  The second train arrives half an hour after the first train (30 minutes after).
* The second train stays for 1/4 the time of the first train (20/4 = 5 minutes).

**3.  Third Train:**

*  The third train arrives one hour after the second train (60 minutes after).
*  The third train departs immediately after it arrives. 

**4.  Fourth Train:**

*  The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train (80 minutes).


**5. Total Wait Time:**

*  To figure out total wait time, we need to consider the time between the third train’s departure and whenever Paul boards the fourth train.


  
{The final answer is 80 minutes} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate Melanie's total toothpicks saved:**

* Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks: 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks

**2. Determine how many more toothpicks are needed:**

*  Melanie needs 200 toothpicks – 120 toothpicks = 80 toothpicks

**3. Calculate how many more weeks it will take:**

* Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week.
* She needs 80 toothpicks.
* Time = Needs / Saving rate 
* Time = 80 toothpicks/ 10 toothpicks/week = 8 weeks

 **The final answer is:** It will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.

*

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1.  Find the price Mr. Rogers paid:**

*  Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, which is 0.75 times the original price. 
* Calculation:  0.75 * $2000 = $1500

**2. Find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for:**

* Mr. Rogers sold the watch for 120% of the price he paid, which is 1.20 times the price he paid. 
* Calculation: 1.20 * $1500 = $1800

**3. Calculate the markup percentage**

* To find the markup percentage, we'll calculate the difference between the selling price and the purchase price and express that as a percentage of the original price. 
* Calculation: ($1800 - $1500) / $2000 * 100% = 150/2000 * 100% = 0.075 * 100% = 7.5%

 
**4. Answer:**

* The percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger’s friend from the original price is 7.5%.


{The final answer is 7.5% } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1.  Calculate the jellyfish production per spring:**

* Since every second a new jellyfish is created, in 1 hour (60 seconds) there are 60 jellyfish. 
 
**2. Calculate the jellyfish production for all springs:**

*  If 5 springs are working at the same rate, they will create a total of 5 * 60 = 300 jellyfish in 1 hour.

**3. Calculate the total jellyfish production in 4 hours:**


* In 4 hours, the total jellyfish production will be 300 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 1200 jellyfish.



 {The final answer is 1200 jellyfish} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

*Steps to solving*

1. **Set up an expression to represent Frankie's score:**
    *  Let 'x' represent Frankie's score.
    *  Twice Binkie's score is 2 * 90 = 180.
    *  Twice as high as Binkie's score is 180.
    *  Frankie's score is 15 better more than twice Binkie's, so x = 180 + 15.

2. **Simplify the expression:**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* We know James's starting point is home (let's assume it's a fixed point).
* He needs to walk to the store at a constant speed of 4 miles per hour.
* Halfway to the store, he changes his plans.
* He has to walk back home.


**2. Calculate the Distance to the Store**

* The problem states the home is 4 miles away from the store, therefore, this is a given
* We know this distance.

**3. Consider the Round Trip**

* He initially walked for a certain time to reach halfway.
* He will then walk back the same distance to home. 
* We need to determine the time for each stage separately. 

**4. Calculate the Time to Reach the Store**

* **Step 1**: Knowing that James walked halfway, we can solve this as follows:  The time it takes to travel halfway is half the total distance the distance is 4 miles / 4 miles per hour.
* **Step 2**: This directly translates to 1 hour. 


**5. Answer**
* The final answer is 1 hour.

Here's how I would solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas**

* Jenny buys 10 bunches.
* Each bunch has 4 bananas.
* Total bananas = 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the bananas individually**

* Each banana costs $0.80.
* Total cost individually = 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the bananas in bunches**

* The cost of a bunch is $3.00.
* Total cost in bunches = $3.00/bunch * 10 bunches = $30.00

**Step 4: Determine the savings**

* Savings = Total cost individually - Total cost in bunches
* Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00

 


**The final answer is:** Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches.

**Solution:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let 'x' represent the length of fencing Sam gets.
   - Harry gets x + 60 feet of fencing. 

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total length of fencing is 100 feet.
   -  Sam's fencing + Harry's fencing = 100 feet.
   -  x + (x + 60) = 100 

3. **Solve the equation for x:**
   - Combine like terms on the left side: 2x + 60 = 100
   - Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40
   - Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

4. **Calculate Harry's fencing:**
   -  Harry gets x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fencing.

5. **Find the amount left over for Sam:**
   - Sam gets x = 20 feet of fencing.
   - Therefore, he gets: 100 - 80 = 20 feet of fencing 


**{The final answer is 20 feet}** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1.  Determine the price of a BMX bike:**

*   BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes.
*   Price of MTB = $500
*   Price of BMX = $500 / 2 = $250

**2. Determine the number of Trekking bikes sold:**

*   Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
*   Number of Trekking bikes sold = 300 bikes * (1/2) = 150 bikes

**3. Determine the number of BMX bikes sold:**

*   15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
*   Number of BMX bikes sold = 300 bikes * (15/100) = 45 bikes

**4. Determine the number of MTB bikes sold:**

*   Number of MTB bikes sold = 300 bikes - 150 bikes - 45 bikes = 105 bikes


**5. Determine Marcel's earnings from each type:**

*   Earnings from Trekking bikes = 150 bikes * $450/bike = $67,500
*   Earnings from BMX bikes = 45 bikes * $250/bike = $11,250
*   Earnings from MTB bikes = 105 bikes * $500/bike =  $52,500


**6. Calculate Marcel's total earnings for the month:**


*   Total earnings = Earnings from Trekking bikes + Earnings from BMX bikes +  Earnings from MTB bikes 
*   Total earnings = $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500= $131,250


 {The final answer is $131,250} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

                    question:
                    There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He : goes ; to class for 5 days a week.  He then spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.  How many hours a week does he spend learning?<end_of_turn>


**Here's a step-by-step process:**

1. **Calculate the total class duration:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Total class duration: 40 minutes/class * 2 classes = 80 minutes

2. **Calculate the weekly class duration:**
   - He takes classes for 5 days a week.
   - Total class time: 80 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 400 minutes

3. **Calculate the extra learning time:**
   - He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning. 
   - Extra learning time: 400 minutes/week * (1/16) = 25 minutes


4. **Calculate the total learning time per week:**
   - The extra learning time is 25 minutes. 
   -  Total weekly learning time: 400 minutes + 25 minutes = 425 minutes

5. **Convert the minutes to hours**
   - There are 60 minutes in 1 hour.
   - Total learning time: 425 minutes/week / 60 minutes/hour = 7.08 hours/week

 
{The final answer is 7.08 hours a week} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class
So he spends 320*5=<<320*5=1600>>1600 minutes a week
That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* Nathan drops a ball from the third-floor balcony (24 feet high).
* After each bounce, the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height.

 **Step 2: Calculate the Ball's Height After the First Bounce**

* The ball starts at 24 feet high.
* After the first bounce, the ball will be at 2/3rd * 24 = 16 feet high.
 

**Step 3: Calculate the Ball's Height After the Second Bounce**

* The ball is now at 16 feet high for the second bounce.
* After the second bounce, the ball will be at 2/3rd * 16 = 10.67 feet high.


**Step 4: Round off to Nearest Feet**

* To get the nearest rounded number, we can round 10.67 to 11 feet

**Final Answer: The ball goes 11 feet high on its second bounce.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after one bounce: 72 feet * 2/3 = <<72*2/3=48>>48 feet
Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet

*

**Here is my breakdown:**

1. **Find the total number of bags:** We know the total number of apples sold and that each bag holds 10 apples.
    *  So, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.
    * That is: 2000 apples / 10 apples/bag = 200 bags

2. **Calculate the total earnings:** Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.
    *  The earnings are calculated by: 200 bags * $5/bag = $1000

 
**The final answer is:** $1000. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","There were 2000/10 = <<2000/10=200>>200 bags of apples sold.
Therefore, the orchard earned 200 x $5 = $<<200*5=1000>>1000.

A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat. How many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate?<end_of_turn>
*Give a detailed solution with reasoning at each step.*

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the problem:** A T-Rex ate half of a small Triceratops. Then, velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. Finally, an Allosaurus consumed the remaining amount.
2. **Define variables:** 
    * Let 'x' represent the original amount of meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate.
3. **Set up equations:**
    * The T-Rex ate half the triceratops meat, so: x / 2 
    * After the T-Rex, the amount left is half of what the T-Rex ate, meaning: (x / 2) / 2
    * The Allosaurus ate the final piece, leaving:  (x / 2) / 2 = 270 
4. **Solve for x:** We are given that the Allosaurus consumed the last 270 kilograms of meat. Solving for x in the final equation, we get: 
    * (x / 2) / 2 = 270
    * (x/4) = 270
    * x = 270 * 4
    * x = 1080

 
**Therefore, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.** {The final answer is 1080} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.
The T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the area of each wall:** 
    * North and South: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft
    * East and West: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft 
2. **Calculate the total area of all the walls:**

* **Step 1:** Define the problem.
* **Step 2:** Model the problem using an appropriate probability concept.
* **Step 3:** Calculate the probability of the friend getting ""sprayed"".

* **Step 4:** Express the probability as a percentage.


Here's a potential solution breakdown for your problem:

**Step 1: Define the Problem**

We're trying to figure out the probability of Ellen's friend getting sprayed with soda from a shaken can. 

**Step 2: Model the Problem Using a Probability Concept**

We can use a probability concept called ""independent trials"". This means each event (Ellen shaking a soda, Ellen's brother taking another soda, etc.) doesn't affect the probability of the next. 

**Step 3: Calculate the Probability**

* We first need to figure out the probabilities of different outcomes (the friend might not get sprayed)
* **Ellen shakes soda**: 3 out of 12. That's 1/4 for each.
* **Ellen's brother takes a soda**: 2 out of the 3 shaken sodas were taken. That's 2/3.
* **Ellen's friend doesn't get sprayed**: Let's call this event A
* **Ellen's friend gets sprayed**: Let's call this event B

To find the probability of getting sprayed, we need to find the probability of getting sprayed, knowing that a shaken soda had been chosen. We can calculate that by finding (probability of a shaken soda being chosen/ total number of sodas), then finding the probability of getting sprayed.



**Step 4: Express the Probability as a Percentage**



 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Figure Out the Speed of Each Train:**

* **Train 1:** Traveling at 60 miles per hour.
* **Train 2:** Traveling at half the speed of Train 1, so 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles per hour.

**2. Calculate the Distance Traveled by Each Train:**

* **Train 1:**  60 miles/hour * 3 hours = 180 miles
* **Train 2:** 30 miles/hour * 3 hours = 90 miles

**3. Use the Difference in Their Paths to Determine the Combined Distance.**

* The trains are traveling in opposite directions, so their movements combine into one point.
* We can calculate the distance traveled in a direct path.
* The total distance they are apart after 3 hours: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles


**The final answer is 270 miles** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Micah's distance:**

* Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
*  Micah's distance = 3.5 * Amber's distance
*  Micah's distance = 3.5 * 8 miles 
*  Micah's distance = 28 miles

**2. Find the total distance Micah and Amber ran:**

* Together, they ran 28 miles + 8 miles = 36 miles
 
**3. Find Ahito's distance:**

*  The total distance is 52 miles and they ran 36 miles together. 
*  Therefore, Ahito ran 52 miles - 36 miles = 16 miles.


{The final answer is 16 miles}<end_of_turn><eos>","Amber ran <<8=8>>8 miles.
Micah ran 3.5 * 8 miles = <<3.5*8=28>>28 miles
Ahito ran the rest = 52 - 8 - 28 = <<52-8-28=16>>16 miles
Ahito ran <<16=16>>16 miles.

What is the new balance on her credit card?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the amount saved on the frying pan:** 
   - 20% of $20.00 is (20/100) * $20.00 = $4.00. 
   - The discounted price of the frying pan is: $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

2. **Calculate the amount saved on the towels:**
   - 10% of $30.00 is (10/100) * $30.00 = $3.00.
   - The discounted price of the towels is: $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items Sheila purchased:**
   - The total was $16.00 (for the frying pan) + $27.00 (for the towels) =  $43.00

4. **Calculate Sheila's remaining balance:**
  - The final balance after her return and purchases is $85.00 - $43.00 = $42.00 


**{The final answer is $42.00}**      

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance
The frying pan is 20% off of $20.00 so .20*20.00 = $<<20*.01*20=4.00>>4.00
The frying pan costs $20.00 and the discount price is $4.00 so the new price is 20-4=$<<20-4=16.00>>16.00
The towel set is 10% off of $30.00 so .10*30 = $<<10*.01*30=3.00>>3.00
The towel set costs $30.00 and the discount price is $3.00 so the new price is 30-3= $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00
Her new purchases total 16+27 = $$<<16+27=43.00>>43.00
After the return, her card balance was $70.00 and she just added $43.00 in purchases so her new balance is 70+43 = $<<70+43=113.00>>113.00

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate Lauren's Savings Rate:**

* Lauren saves 20% of every paycheck.

**2. Calculate Lauren's Annual Savings:**

*  To find this we must figure out how much money she saves each paycheck, then work backwards to calculate her annual savings.
 
**3. Calculate Lauren's Current Net Income:**

*  We will be considering Lauren’s current income and her savings rate.
*  To find this we must figure out the amount Lauren's current income needs to cover this savings rate.


**4. Calculate how much Lauren will need to save over 20 years:**

*  Find the total amount of her savings needs based on the annual savings amount.

**5. Calculate how many years it will take Lauren to reach her goal:**

**6.  Calculate the number of additional years**



Let me know if you would like me to work through these calculations step-by-step!

If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year

                    How many girls are in the ! school if 40% of a school population is made up of 240 boys?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown:

**1. Understand the Problem:**
    * We know that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. 
    * This means the school population can be represented as 100% 
   
**2.  Set up a Percentage Equation:** 
    * Let 'x' represent the total number of girls in the school.
    * We know that 40% of the school population is boys, which is represented as 0.40x.
    * We also know that 100% - 40% = 60% of the school population are girls.
    * We can write this as an equation: 0.24x = 240
 

**3. Solve for x:**
    * We know that 0.24x = 240. To isolate x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.24.
    * x = 240 / 0.24 
    * x = 1000

**4. Final Answer:**
 * The final answer is {1000 girls}  



Let me know if you'd like any more complex problem-solving or want clarification on any of the steps! <end_of_turn><eos>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

*steps*

1. **Determine the amount of apples Pierre will take:**
   - Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples. 
   - Quarter of 12 kg = (1/4) * 12 kg = 3 kg

2. **Determine the amount of apples Paul will take:** 
   - Paul wants 1/3 of the total apples.
   - 1/3 of 12 kg = (1/3) * 12 kg = 4 kg

3. **Calculate the total amount of apples Pierre and Paul will take:**

*  This means the $2 represents the cost of the books she hasn't bought yet.


**3. Set up an equation:**

* We can represent the cost of each book as ""x."" 
* Since Anna spent $2, she had $12 remaining, and she spent $2.
*   Total cost of the books: 2x = $12


**4. Solve for x (the cost of each book):**
* Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x:
  2x / 2 = $12 / 2
  x = $6

**5. Final answer:**

*  Each book cost $6. {The final answer is $6} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.
She has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 – $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.
Therefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.

                    question:
                    Last year there were 50 students enrolled in a calligraphy class. This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment. How many students are enrolled this year ; in the ; calligraphy class?<end_of_turn>
*Answer steps*

1. **Define the increase:** We know that the enrollment increased by 20%. This means the new enrollment will be 120% of the previous enrollment.

2. **Calculate the new enrollment:** To find the new enrollment, we can calculate 120% of the previous enrollment.
   * 120% can be written as 1.20 (because 120/100)

3. **Set up the multipierical equation:**
   * New enrollment = previous enrollment * 1.20 
   * New enrollment = 50 students * 1.20


4. **Solve for the new enrollment:**
  * New enrollment = 60 students

 {The final answer is 60 students} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There was an increase of 50 x 20/100 = <<50*20/100=10>>10 students in enrollment.
So, there is a total of 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 students who were enrolled this year.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine the total round trip distance.**

*  He drives to his parents' house, and then back. 
*  Total distance per trip = Speed × Time 
*  Total Distance = 70 mph × 2 hours = 140 miles

**2. Calculate the total miles driven per month.**

*  He visits twice a month. 
*  Total miles driven per month = 140 miles/trip × 2 trips/month 
*  Total miles driven per month = 280 miles


**3. State the final result.**

**Solution:**
1. **Determine Sofie's total daily distance:** Sofie will walk 10 miles per day for 7 days. 
   *  This means Sofie's total distance is 10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles.

2. **Find Brian's distance per day:** Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, so Brian will walk half of Sofie's distance.
   *  This means Brian can walk 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles.

 {The final answer is} 35 miles

* **Consider the information and ask: What do we need to find?**
  * We need to determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces to fulfill the order.

* **Consider the given information:**
  * 2 workers produce 6 toys/hour each, for a combined production of 12 toys/hour.
  * 2 other workers produce 4 toys/hour each, for a combined production of 8 toys/hour.
  * They work a 10-hour shift. 
  * The manufacturer needs 20 more toys at the end of their shift. 
  * Total production rate = Production rate of the first 2 workers + Production Rate of the other 2 workers
 
* **We can start to model the workflow:**
  * Calculate the production rate of the first two groups. 
  * How many toys are produced in total by the first two groups (in order for them to finish the order)
* **Determine the missing piece:** 
  * They need to produce an additional 20 toys to ship the order.
  



Let me know if you'd like me to break down the calculation of the total toy production rate or the detailed steps for determining the missing piece and we can further work this problem.
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Find the weight of Elijah's first dog:**

*  Kory's dog is 60 pounds, and Elijah's first dog is one-fourth of that.
*  One-fourth of 60 pounds is (1/4) * 60 = 15 pounds.

**2. Find the weight of Elijah's second dog:**

* Kory's dog is 60 pounds, and Elijah's second dog is half the weight of that. 
* Half of 60 pounds is (1/2) * 60 = 30 pounds.

**3. Calculate the total weight of Elijah’s dogs:**

* The total weight of Elijah's two dogs is 15 pounds + 30 pounds = 45 pounds.

**4. Calculate the total weight of Kory’s dog:**

 *  We know Kory’s dog weighs 60 pounds.

**5. Calculate the total weight of both dogs:**

 * The total weight is 45 pounds (Elijah's dogs) + 60 pounds (Kory's dog) = 105 pounds.

The : 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. ; The average car can go 120 Miles ; per hour. How fast does the faster car go?<end_of_turn>


**Let's Break It Down:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   *  Let `x` represent the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
   
2. **Translate the Information into Equations:**
   *  ""The faster car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car"" translates to the equation: `faster car speed = 1.25 * x` 
   * ""The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car""  translates to the equation: `2nd fastest car speed = 5 * 120 miles/hour`
   * ""The average car can go 120 miles/hour"" translates to the equation: `average car speed = 120 miles/hour`

3. **Solve for the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**
   *  From the third equation, we know that the speed of the 2nd fastest car is 600 miles/hour (5 * 120).


4. **Find the speed of the faster car:**
   * Substitute the value of the 2nd fastest car speed into the first equation: `faster car speed = 1.25 * 600` 
  

**Calculate:**
* `faster car speed = 750`


 **Answer:**  The faster car goes 750 miles per hour.  {The final answer is 750 miles per hour.}

*Solution*

**Step 1:** Define the variables. 
*Let Liam's age two years ago be ""L""*. This represents the unknown we are trying to find.
*Let Vince's age two years ago be ""V""*.  

**Step 2:** Set up an equation based on the given information.
We are told that two years ago, Liam's age *was twice* Vince's age:
 L = 2V

**Step 3:** Use known information to solve for Vince's age.
*We know Liam's current age is 16.*  To find Vince's age now, we can use the equation from step 2.
*L = 2V*
*We can rewrite the equation in terms of Vince's age:*
*16 = 2V*
*Isolate V by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: *
*8 = V*


**Step 4:**  State the final answer.
 *Vince is now 8 years old.* {The final answer is 8}

If he puts all of his crayons into boxes, what ? is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons , and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to a pound?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1.  Calculate the number of groups:**
   * He has 200 crayons, and each group needs 8 crayons.
   * Number of groups = 200 crayons / 8 crayons/group = 25 groups

**2. Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   * Each crayon weighs 0.1 ounces.
   * Total weight of crayons = 25 groups * 8 crayons/group * 0.1 ounces/crayon = 2 ounces

**3. Calculate the total weight of all the boxes:**
* Each box weighs 8 ounces.
* Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes * 8 ounces / box = 200 ounces

**4. Convert ounces to pounds:**
* There are 16 ounces in 1 pound.
* Total pounds of crayons and boxes = 200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 12.5 pounds

 
{The final answer is 12.5 pounds} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the volume of logs:**
   -  John cuts 80% of the tree into 4-foot logs. 
   -  To find the number of logs he gets from the tree,  divide the total tree length by the log length: 80 feet / 4 feet per log = 20 logs

2. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
   -  He cuts 5 planks from each 4-foot log.
   -  So, he gets 5 planks per log.

3. **Calculate the total number of planks:**
   -  He uses 20 logs, and each log gives him 5 planks, so the total number of planks is 20 * 5 = 100 planks
      

4. **Calculate the earnings per plank:**
   -  He sells each plank for $1.2
   -  Therefore, earnings from each plank is $1.2.


5. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   -  He earns $1.2 for each plank, and 100 planks, giving him $1.2 * 100 = $120

 
{The final answer is $120} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.
That gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.
So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.

Here's how to break down the solution:

**1.  Determine brother's salary:**

* Valerie's brother earns 1/2 of Valerie's salary.
* Brother's salary = (1/2) * $5000 = $2500

**2. Determine the combined salary of Valerie and her brother:**

* Combined salary = Valerie's salary + Brother's salary
* Combined salary = $5000 + $2500 = $7500

**3. Determine the mother's salary:**

* The mother earns twice their combined salary.
* Mother's salary = 2 * $7500 = $15000 

**4. The total amount of money they all have together:**

* Total amount = Mother's salary + Combined salary 
* Total amount = $15000 + $7500 = $22500

If 40 minutes of her walk ! is spent on the beach, how long does it take for ! her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?<end_of_turn>


**Here's a step-by-step solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   -  Let  'x' represent the speed Grandma walks on the beach (miles per minute).
   -  Let '2x' represent the speed Grandma walks on the sidewalk (miles per minute, since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as on the beach).

2. **Calculate Time on the Beach:**
   -  The time it takes to walk 2 miles on the beach is (2 miles) / (x miles per minute) =  2/x minutes.

3. **Calculate Time on the Sidewalk:**
   - The time it takes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is (1 mile) / (2x miles per minute) = 1/(2x) minutes.

4. **Calculate Total Time:** 
   -  The total time for Grandma's walk is (2/x) + (1/(2x))=  (2 + 1)/(2x) = 3/(2x) minutes. 

5. **Solve for Time:**
  - The total time, in minutes, for Grandma's entire 3-mile walk is given by (3/(2x)) minutes 


**Final answer: {The final answer is 3/(2x) minutes}<end_of_turn><eos>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

2. **Determine remaining savings goal:**
    * Subtract total savings from desired savings goal: $60 - $32 = $28 remaining.

3. **Calculate remaining weeks:**

Here's how we can work it out step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of marbles after getting 2 dozen.**

* A dozen has 12 items, so 2 dozen is 2 * 12 = 24 marbles.
* Bob will have 24 + ? marbles.

**Step 2: Set up an equation based on the given information.**

* We know Bob has 60 marbles after receiving 24 more.
* Let 'x' represent the number of marbles Bob start with.
* So, x + 24 = 60 {We set up an equation} 

**Step 3: Solve for the initial number of marbles (x).**

* Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: x = 60 - 24 
* Therefore, x = 36.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of marbles after losing 10**.

* Bob starts with 36 marbles and loses 10
* Bob has 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.




{The final answer is 26.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.

* Provide a step-by-step explanation. 

Let's break this problem down:

**1. Understand the Problem:** 

* We need to figure out how many potatoes Gomer ate.
* We're given information about how many scoops he ate and the steps involved to make a single serving.
 
**2. Translate the Given Information:**

* ""Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes"" means  Gomer started with 23 scoops, and then subtracted 5. This translates to 23 - 5 = 18 scoops 
* ""If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes... ""this means we need to figure out the number of potatoes to make 1 serving. The problem gives us 6 potatoes and subtracts 3.


**3. Apply Logic & Reasoning: **


* **Need to determine the number of potatoes.**
* To understand this fully, we need to understand that the information about quantities of potatoes isn't directly connected to the scoop amount.


**4. Final Thoughts:**

* We have a problem where all the information is related to scoops of mashed potatoes, but the steps for the amount of potatoes aren't directly related.




Let me know if you'd like to try a different problem!

Here's the breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Calculate total lemons from one year**

* Tim collects 6 lemons per tree. 
* He has 5 trees.
* Total lemons per year: 6 lemons/tree * 5 trees = 30 lemons

**Step 2: Calculate the number of years in a decade**

* A decade is 10 years.

**Step 3: Calculate the total lemons over a decade**

* Total lemons per year: 30 lemons 
* Number of years in a decade: 10 years
* Total lemons over a decade: 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons

*The problem is:* 

**Step 1: Define proportions and variables.**
* Let 'm' be the number of men on the bus. 
* Let 'w' be the number of women on the bus.

**Step 2: Set up an equation based on the initial ratio.**
* The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.
* This means: m/w = 5/9
* We can use the given information (total passengers: 84) to get an equation.

**Step 3:  Use the given information to find 'm'**
* We know the number of total passengers is 84.
*  m + w = 84
 

**Step 4: Solve for 'w' (the number of women) in terms of 'm'**
*We can use the equation  m + w = 84 to express 'w' in terms of 'm'. 

**Step 5: Substitute 'w' in terms of 'm' into the original ratio equation**
* We now have an equation containing 'm' and 'w'
* Substitute 'w' in terms of 'm' to solve for 'm'.


{The final answer is}

**1. Determine earnings per sunflower:**

* Faraday earns $2 per sunflower.

**2.  Determine earnings per bouquet:**
* He earns $8 per bouquet.
* Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers. 

**3. Calculate the earnings from sole sunflowers:**
* Day 1 earnings: $26

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy:**

* He has $100.
* Each rock costs $5.
* Number of rocks: $100 / $5 = 20 rocks

**2. Calculate Adam's expected revenue from selling all his rocks:**

*  Number of rocks: 20
*  Total revenue: $7/rock * 20 rocks = $140

**3. Calculate the amount Adam expects to earn from selling 60% of his rocks:**

*  Revenue from 60% of the rocks: $140 * 0.60 = $84

**4. Calculate his expected loss:**

*  Expected Revenue: $84
*  Investment: $100 {This is Adam's starting investment}

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate Sid's speed for the first leg of the journey.**

* Speed = Distance / Time
* Speed = 110 miles / 2 hours
* Speed = 55 miles per hour (mph)

**2. Calculate Sid's speed for the second leg of the journey.**

* Speed = Distance / Time

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the probability of the second ticket winning:**

* The second ticket is ""three times more likely"" to win. 
*  This means the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * the probability of the first ticket winning.
*  Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is 3 * 20% = 60%.

**2. Calculate the probability of both tickets winning:**

*  To find this, we need to find the probability of each ticket winning *and* the other ticket winning.
*  We do this by multiplying the probability of each individual event.
* Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of first ticket winning * Probability of second ticket winning 
* Probability of both tickets winning = 20% * 60% = 12%

Here is the breakdown of the solution

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one device**
   * The selling price of each device is twice the original price, which is $20 * 2 = $40.

**Step 2: Calculate the total selling price of the devices from Monday**
   * Linus sold 2 devices on Monday at a price of $40 per device. 
   * So, the total price he sold on Monday is $40 * 2 = $80.

**Step 3: Calculate the total selling price of devices from Tuesday**
   * Linus sold 4 devices on Tuesday at a price of $40 per device.  
   * So, the total price he sold on Tuesday is $40 * 4 = $160.

**Step 4: Calculate the total earnings**
   *  Linus's total earnings from selling both sets of devices is $80 + $160 = $240.

**Step 5: Calculate the profit**
   *  Profit is the earnings minus the cost of the devices.

                    question:
                    The Hortex company produces : bottled carrot juices. Every day it can produce 4200 bottles of these juices. Each juice can cover 20% of 1 person'ts daily energy demand. . How ; many more bottles of juices would Hortex have , to produce to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the solution:

**1. Calculate the daily energy demand per person:**

* Each juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy demand. 
* Therefore, the energy demand of one person is 100% / 0.20 = 500 Joules. 

**2. Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people:**

* Total energy demand = 2300 individuals * 500 Joules/individual 
* Total energy demand = 1150,000 Joules

**3. Calculate the number of juices needed to fulfill 100% of the daily energy demand:**

* The number of juices to cover the total demand is 1150,000 Joules / (20% of 500 Joules/juice)
* The number of juices needed is 1150,000 / 1000 = 1150 juices.

**4. Calculate how many extra juices are needed:**

*  Extra juices = 1150 juices - 4200 juices
*  Extra juices = -2,050 juices


**The final answer is: -2,050 bottles. **



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of babies in each color:**

* **Purple:** (3/4) * 8 = 6 babies 
* **Blue:** (1/4) * 8 = 2 babies

**2. Calculate the number of babies wearing bows:**

* **Purple with bow:** (1/3) * 6 = 2 babies
* **Blue with bow:** (1/3) * 2 = 2/3 babies

**3. Determine the likelihood of a baby wearing a bow being purple:**
 
 The chance of a baby wearing a bow being purple is the number of babies wearing a bow that are also wearing purple divided by the total number of babies wearing a bow.
 
 This is (2 babies / 2 + 2/3 babies) 


 
**{The final answer is} 1/3** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies
Then multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies
Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

He then sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. How much money will he be able to earn after selling all his unused land?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the first land sale:**
    - Abraham sold half of his land, which is 80 square meters / 2 = 40 square meters.
    - He sold the land for $50.
2. **Calculate the second land sale:**
    - He sold 1/4 of his land, which is 80 square meters * (1/4) = 20 square meters.
    - He sold the land for $30.
3. **Calculate the remaining land:**
    - Total land sold before the remaining land = 40 square meters + 20 square meters = 60 square meters
4. **Calculate remaining land sale price:**
    - He sells the remaining land for $3 per square meter, so he will get 60 square meters * $3/square meter = $180.


**Final Answer:** {He will be able to earn $210.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1:  Define the variables**

* Let 'G' represent Geb's age.
* Let 'H' represent Haley's age.

**Step 2: Formulate the equations**

The problem tells us:

*  Geb is 10 less than half Haley's age: G = (1/2)H - 10 
*  Haley is 26 years old: H = 26

**Step 3: Substitute and solve for Geb's age (G)**

Substitute the value of 'H' from Step 2 into the first equation:
  G = (1/2)(26) - 10

Simplify:
  G = 13 - 10
  G = 3

**Step 4:  State the answer**

The final answer is: G = 3

**Solution:**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Initial Production:**

* A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.


**2. Sixth Year Production:**

* A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the output of a 5-year-old: 50 * 3 = 150 fruits.

**3. Seventh Year Production:**

* A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the output of a 5-year-old: 50 * 7 = 350 fruits.

**4. Eighth Year Production:**

* An 8-year-old tree produces 200 less than a 7-year-old: 350 - 200 = 150 fruits.

**7. Total Production over 10 Years**
* Add the fruits from each year: 50 + 150 + 350 + 150 + 0 + 1000 = {1450 fruits} 
 

**Therefore, an avocado tree can produce a total of 1450 fruits during its 10 years of life. **

Let's break down how to solve this step by step:

**1. Define the Variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the length of the blue rope in centimeters. 
*  The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope, so it's length is 4x.
*  The yellow rope is represented by 'y', and we know it's length is x + 7 because it is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope.


**2. Set up the Equation:**

The total length of the three ropes is 37, meaning the sum of blue, red, and yellow rope's can be written as:
x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37

**3. Solve for the Blue Rope Length:**

Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:
6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:
x = 5

**4. Calculate the Length of the Red Rope:**

Substitute the value of 'x' (the length of the blue rope) into the equation for the length of the red rope:
4x = 4 * 5 = 20

**5. The Answer:**

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. {The final answer is 20} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.

{The final answer is.}
The given information suggests a problem involving ratios and amounts of money. Let's break it down step-by-step to reach the answer.

**Step 1:  Representing the amount of money given to Ronnie**

* Let's represent the initial amount given to Ronnie as 'x'.

**Step 2:  Calculate the amount given to Rissa**

* Rissa received thrice the amount given to Ronnie, so she received 3x.

**Step 3: Representing the equal amount given to both sisters**

* Each sister received an equal amount, let's denote this common amount as 'y'. 

**Step 4: Formulate an equation based on the relationship in Rissa's case**

* Rissa was left with 4/5 of her money. We can use the fact that the amount given to each of them is added to the common amount to write an equation representing Rissa's situation. 
 * 3x + y = (4/5) *  (3x)

**Step 5: Substitute the initial amounts**

* We have an equation with two unknowns (x and y). We now need to solve the system of equations we have. 
 
**Step 6: Solve for the common amount (y) **


* We can now use any of the original equations to solve for y while substituting the initial values to express the final amount left.

 {The final answer is}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.
This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

Each day after that through Friday, though, she sees double the number ; of clouds in the sky as the day before. At the end of the week, how many clouds will she have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate Tuesday's count.**

* Alice sees double the number of clouds as Monday's count. 
* 3 puffs * 2 = 6 puffs of clouds.

**Step 2: Calculate Wednesday's count.**

* Alice sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday's count.
* 6 puffs * 2 = 12 puffs of clouds. 

**Step 3: Calculate Thursday's count.**

* Alice sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday's count.
* 12 puffs * 2 = 24 puffs of clouds.

**Step 4: Calculate Friday's count.**

* Alice sees double the number of clouds as Thursday's count.
* 24 puffs * 2 = 48 puffs of clouds.

**Step 5: Calculate the total count for all five days.**

* 3 puffs + 6 puffs + 12 puffs + 24 puffs + 48 puffs = 97 puffs

{The final answer is 97} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Calculate the number of pods in the new box.**

* The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
* 20% of 100 pods = (20/100) * 100 = 20 pods 
* New box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.

**2. Calculate the price of one cycle with the new box.**

* The price of one cycle is $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod
 


**3. Calculate the number of cycles you can run with the new box.** 
 
*  Each cycle uses 1 pod, and the box has 120 pods.
* You can run 120 cycles / 1 pod/cycle = 120 cycles


{The final answer is 120} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

* He loses 10 bills: $1000 - $100 = $900

**Step 2: Determine the number of bills remaining.**

* Thomas has $900.
* Each $20 bill contains 20 dollars. 
* We need to figure out how many bills are worth $900.
* To find the number of $20 bills, let's assume there were a number of bills. *this would be a starting point to figure out the number of $20 bills.


**Step 3: Calculate the number of $20 bills after paying for the bill.**

* We need to figure out how many bills were in his new total.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Calculate the number of girls on varsity.**

* One-third of the girls is (1/3) * 12 = 4 girls.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of boys on varsity.**

* One-fourth of the boys is (1/4) * 12 = 3 boys.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let Wendy's current age be 'w'
* Let Colin's current age be 'c'

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information**

*  ""Wendy is five times, as old as Colin will be seven years from now""  
   * This translates to the equation: w = 5(c + 7) 
* ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now""
   * This translates to the equation: w + 25 = (3/4)(w + 25)

**Step 3: Solve the equations simultaneously**

* We now have two equations with two unknowns:
   * w = 5(c + 7)  
   * w + 25 = (3/4)(w + 25) 
* Solve the second equation for 'w':
   * w + 25 = (3/4)w + (3/4)25
   * w + 25 - (3/4)w = (3/4)25 
   * (1/4)w + 25 = (3/4)25 
   * (1/4)w = (3/4)25 - 25
   * (1/4)w = (3/4)*25 - 25 * (4/4)
   * (1/4)w = 18.75 - 100
   * (1/4)w = -81.25
   * w = -81.25 * 4
   * w = -325
*  This result doesn't make sense in the context of age.


**Step 4:  Addressing the Inconsistencies**
 
*  Let's re-examine our approach. The initial statements are not well-defined and create inconsistencies.


**Final Answer:**
It's not possible to determine Colin's current age using the information provided.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of books**
* Bob's budget is $27000.
* Each purchase of 100 books costs $500.
* To find the number of books he can buy, divide the total budget by the cost per book.
* Number of books = Total budget / Cost per book


* **Calculation:** Number of books = $27000 / $500 = 54 books

**Step 2: Find the number of books per School**

* Bob is buying books from 3 schools.
* You need to divide the total number of books by the number of schools.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is 54 books}

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Determine the snowball-building rate.**

* Jay builds 20 snowballs in one hour. 
*  So, his hourly rate of building is 20 snowballs/hour.
    
**Step 2:  Calculate the time to build the first 1 snowballs.** 

* Jay builds 20 snowballs every hour
* To build one snowball it takes one hour.

**Step 3: Account for melting snowballs**

* Every 15 minutes, two snowballs melt.
* This means 2 snowballs / 15 minutes = 1/7.5 snowballs per minute
    


**Final Answer:** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

                    question:
                    Digimon had its 20th anniversary. !  When it came out John was twice as old as Jim.  If John is 28 now how old is : Jim?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Understand the information:**

*  John is 28 now. 
*  John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.

**2. Set up variables:**

* Let 'J' represent John's age when Digimon came out.
* Let 'I' represent Jim's age when Digimon came out.

**3. Formulate an equation:**

* We know that John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out.  This translates to the equation:  J = 2I 
 
**4. Use the information about John's current age:**

*  We know that John is 28 now. We can use this to express another equation. 
* J = 28

**5. Solve for Jim's age:**

* We have an equation for John's age (J = 28) and an equation relating their age at the time of Digimon's release (J = 2I).
* Substitute the value of J from step 4 into the second equation 
    28 = 2I
* Solve for I by dividing both sides by 2:
    14 = I

**6. Final Answer:**

{The final answer is Jim was 14 years old when Digimon came out.} 



Let me know if you need me to break down any of these steps in more detail! <end_of_turn><eos>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8
So Jim was 8/2=<<8/2=4>>4 years old
That means John is now 4+20=<<4+20=24>>24

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate earnings from each task:**
   * Washing laundry: $3.00
   * Cleaning his room: $1.50
   * Taking out the trash: $0.75 * 2 = $1.50 (Since he took it out twice)
   * Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

2. **Add earnings from each task together:**

**Explanation:**

* **Step 1: Find the number of black pens.**
   * Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. 
   * So, if the mom bought 5 packs of red pens, she bought 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens. 
* **Step 2: Find the total number of pens from the red pens.**
   * Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. 
   * So, she bought 5 * 5 = 25 pens.
* **Step 3: Find the total number of pens from the black pens.**
   * Alain's mom bought 10 packs of black pens, and each pack has 5 pens.
   * So, she bought 10 * 5 = 50 pens.
* **Step 4: Find the total number of pens.**

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the price of one bottle of scotch:**
    * Price per bottle of scotch: $600 / 10 bottles = $60 per bottle.
 
2. **Calculate the price of one bottle of cognac:**
    *  Cognac costs 50% more than scotch, so it costs $60 + (0.50 * $60) = $90 per bottle. 
 
3. **Calculate the number of bottles of cognac:**
    * John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cognac:** 
    * Total cost of cognac: 20 bottles * $90/bottle = $1800.

5. **Calculate the total cost of all his purchases:**
   *  Total cost of everything: $600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400 




{The final answer is $2400}<end_of_turn><eos>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each

## Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial amount:** 
   - Fred began with 24 gallons of root beer.

2. **Calculate the root beer lost after the children's snack:**  
   -  Children took 4 gallons.
   -   24 - 4 = 20 gallons remaining.

3. **Calculate the root beer lost after Barbie's spill:**
   -  Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   -  20 - 7 = 13 gallons remaining.

4. **Calculate the root beer lost after Ronnie's visit:** 
   - Ronnie took 5 gallons
   - 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remaining. 


5. **Calculate the root beer available for the party:**  
   - 8 gallons. 

6. **Calculate the amount to be shared among the four people:**
    -  8 gallons / 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

 {The final answer is 2 gallons.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.
If the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Define a Variable:** 
   - Let 'x' represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

**2. Set up an Equation:**
   - ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" translates to the expression 4x + 8.
   - ""Is 40"" means this expression equals 40:  4x + 8 = 40

**3. Solve for x:**
   - Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 32
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 8

 


{The final answer is} 8 coffee mugs. <end_of_turn><eos>","Let m be the number of mugs

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Find the number of fish with red stripes.**

* One-third of the fish have red stripes. 
* (1/3) * 66 fish = 22 fish 

**Step 2: Find the number of fish that are not red striped.**

* Total fish - fish with red stripes = fish not with red stripes
* 66 fish - 22 fish = 44 fish 

**Step 3: Find the number of fish with blue stripes.**

* 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
* (5/11) * 44 fish = 20 fish

**Step 4: Find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.**

* 22 fish (red stripes) + 20 fish (blue stripes) = 42 fish


{The final answer is 42 fish.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish

*Begin by breaking down the initial amounts.*

*Step 1:  Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors from the two palettes.*
    * Amy has 2 palettes * 4 colors/palette = 8 eyeshadow colors.

*Step 2: Calculate the total eyeshadow colors from the three makeup sets.*
    * She has 3 makeup sets * 6 colors/set = 18 eyeshadow colors.

*Step 3: Calculate the total eyeshadow colors Amy has.*
    *  Amy has 8 eyeshadow colors + 18 eyeshadow colors = 26 eyeshadow colors.

    * Amy's sister stole one of the palettes, which had 8 colors.


*Step 5: Calculate the eyeshadow colors remaining.*
    *  She has 26 eyeshadow colors - 8 eyeshadow colors = 18 eyeshadow colors left.

**The final answer is:** 18



<end_of_turn><eos>","Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.
Her sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.
Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.
Thus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1.  Calculate the height of the first floor:**

*   Mattison's height : 60 inches
*   Floor to the ceiling on the first floor: 3 times his height, so 3 * 60 = 180 inches.

**2.  Find the height of the second floor:**

*   Height of first floor: 180 inches.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Low setting:**

*   The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.

**2. Medium setting:**

*   The medium setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, which removes 1 liter per day.
*   Therefore, the medium setting removes 1 * 2 = 2 liters per day.

**3. High setting:**

*   The high setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, which removes 2 liters per day. 
*   Therefore, the high setting removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day.

**4. Total water removed:**

*   **Day 1-3 (Low setting):** 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters
*   **Day 4-6 (Medium setting):** 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters
*   **Day 7-11 (High setting):** 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters

**5. Total Water Removed:**

Here's how we solve it step-by-step:

1. **Total balloons:** 
   * Jolene and her friends started with 10 packs of balloons.
   * Each pack has 30 balloons.
   * So, the total number of balloons is 10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons.

2. **Balloons thrown:**
   * They began with 300 balloons.
   * They had 12 balloons left.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Find the volume of the second medicine:**

   * The second medicine needs 3 times the amount of the first medicine.
   * So, the second medicine needs 3 * 14 mL = 42 mL.

**2. Find the total volume of one dose:**

   *  The total volume of one dose is the sum of the first medicine and the second medicine.
   *  Total volume: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

**3. Find the total volume of 8 doses:**

   *  The total volume for 8 doses is the total volume for one dose multiplied by 8.
   *  Total volume: 56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.

**The final answer is:** 448 mL

How much will ; Stephen pay in the twelfth month?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the Interest:** 
   *  2% of $300 = (2/100) * $300 = $6
   
**2. Calculate the total repayment amount of the 11 months:**
   * Total repayment = $25/month * 11 months = $275
   
**3. Calculate the total amount to be paid on the 12th month:**
   *  Total to be paid = Total repayment + Interest = $275 + $6 = $281


 {The final answer is $281} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

*Step-by-step reasoning*
1. **Identify the information provided.**
    * Jordan has two children.
    * Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day.
    * Jordan's wife changes half the diapers.

2. **Set up an equation.**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of diapers Jordan changes per day.
    * The wife changes half the diapers, so she changes (1/2) * 2 diapers = 1 diaper.
    * Total diaper changes from kids: 2 children * 5 changes/child = 10 diaper changes
  
3. **Work out a solution to the equation.** 
      * We know 10 diaper changes total
      * We know the wife changes one diaper.

 *The final answer is*

                    question:
                    Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.

The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the Volume of the Jar:**
   * The base of the jar is a square, so the area of the base is 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches.
   * The volume of the jar (V) is the area of the base times its height: V = 36 square inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches.

**2. Calculate the Volume of a Jelly Bean:**
   * The volume of a single jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches.

**3. Calculate the Capacity of the Jar After Accounting for Efficiency:**
   * The jar's efficiency is 80% meaning that his storage capacity is 80% of the total volume. 
   *  Therefore, the volume of the jar after efficiency accounting is: 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

**4. Determine the Estimated Volume of Red Jelly Beans:**
   *  Tim estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red, therefore we multiply the estimate of the total number of red jelly beans and the number of jelly beans that are red 
   * Estimated volume of red jelly beans = 900 jelly beans * 0.30 = 270 cubic inches. 

**5. Find the Difference in Estimates:**

   * The difference is the final calculation.
   * Difference = Estimated Volume - True Volume
   * Difference = 270 cubic inches - 432 cubic inches = -162 cubic inches

**6. Express the Result**

{The final answer is -162 cubic inches} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to ; the museum?<end_of_turn>


**Solution**

1. **Calculate the cost increase:** 
   - The cost increased by 150% of $2, meaning it increased by 1.50 times the original cost.
   - The new cost per visit is 1.50 * $2 = $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the additional 3 years:**
   - Pauline visits the museum 3 more years, each at $3.
   - The total cost for these three years is $3 * 3 = $9.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all 5 years:**
   - The total cost for all 5 years is the cost for one visit multiplied by the number of visits.
   - Total cost: ($2 * 3) + ($3 * 3) {This reflects the base cost for year 1, and continuing costs for 3 years.}
 


{The final answer is $18.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Understand the given information**

* The board is 40 feet long.
* Ian wants to cut the board into two pieces.
* The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

**Step 2:  Define variables**

Let:
*  *x*  represent the length of the shorter piece. 
* *4x* represent the length of the longer piece.

**Step 3: Set up an equation**

Since the longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece:
  *4x = longer piece*

**Step 4: Use the board length to relate the variables.** 

The longer piece must be a part of the 40-foot board.


**Step 5: Solve for the shorter piece**

* The longer piece length is *4x*.
* The shorter piece length is *x*.


**The final answer is** The length of the longer piece is 4x feet. Substitute the desired value of *x* to get the final answer.
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.
Adding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.
Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

Let 'x' be the number of inches of rain on Tuesday.

**Step 2:  Set up an expression**

* Monday's rainfall: 2 inches
* Twice Monday's rainfall: 2 * 2 = 4 inches
*  One more inch than twice Monday's rainfall: 4 + 1 = 5 inches

**Step 3: Write the equation**
The total rainfall on Tuesday is x inches.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Set up the equation:**

* Let 'c' represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.
* Let 'b' represent the number of brownies Carly made.

We know the following:

*  ""2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes"":  3c - 2 = b
* ""Carly's class has five people"": b + c = 5 (total treats shared by students)

**2. Solve for the number of cupcakes:**

* **Isolate 'b' in the first equation:** 
   * 3c - 2 = b
* **We know 'b' is equal to the sum of cupcakes and brownies:** 
   *  b + c = 5

**3. Substitute 'b' into the second equation:**

* Since b = 3c - 2, we can substitute this into the second equation.
   * (3c - 2) + c = 5

**4. Simplify and Solve for 'c':**

* Combine the 'c' terms: 4c - 2 = 5
* Add 2 to both sides: 4c = 7 
* Divide both sides by 4: c = 1.75

**5.  Interpret the value of 'c':**

* We can't have fractional cupcakes!  Let's convert this to whole numbers for an accurate solution

{ The answer is 2 } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

*step-by-step solving*

1. **Identify the known information:** 
   * The 3 magazines send 12 issues a year.
   * There is one magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
   * The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine.

2. **Translate this information into a mathematical expression:**
   * Let's use variables to represent the number of magazines for each type.
   * Let's call the number of 12-issue magazines ""x""
   * Let's call the number of the 6-issue magazine ""y"" 
   * The last magazine number ""z""

3. **Set up equations to relate the variables:**
   * Statement 1: x + y + z = 3   (Total number of magazines)
   * Statement 2: y = 6   (6 issue magazine amount) 
   * Statement 3: z = 4y   (Last magazine sends 4x time the 6-issue magazine amount)

4. **Solve the equation(s):**
   *  We know y=6 and z=4y.
   * Substitute y from statement 2 intoStatement 3:  z=4(6) 
   * We know z is equal to 4(6). 
   * Finally, we need to find x.


5. **Explain the final answer:**
       * {The final answer is 3 magazines}




<end_of_turn><eos>","She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues
Her last magazine sends her 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine so that’s 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 issues
All total she receives 36+24+6 = <<36+24+6=66>>66 magazine issues a year

*Show clear work**

**1.**  **Let's define the variables:**

*  Let *x* represent the number of paintings Kim has.

**2.**  **Set up the equation based on the information given:**

* Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley:  x + 12 = Shelley's paintings
* Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim:  Shelley's paintings - 8 = Kim's paintings 

**3.**  **Substitute the given information:**

*  We know Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we can substitute this into the equation.
*  We know Samantha has 27 paintings, so we can substitute this into the equation.

**4.**  **Simplify the equation and solve for Kim's paintings:**

*  We now know Samantha has 27 paintings.
*  We can substitute 27 for Samantha's painting to create an equation.

**5.**  **Final Step:**

* Solve the simplified equation to find Kim's number of paintings.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the price increase in December.**

* Multiply the original price by the percentage increase: $40 * 0.80 = $32

**Step 2: Determine the price after the December increase.**

*  Add the price increase to the original price: $40 + $32 =  $72.

**Step 3: Calculate the price discount in January.**

* Multiply the price after the December increase by the percentage discount: $72 * 0.50 = $36

**Step 4: Find the price after the January discount.**

* Subtract the January discount from the price after December: $72 - $36 = $36


{The final answer is $36} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.
The 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32
In December, the toy's price was 40 + 32 = $<<40+32=72>>72.
The 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36
In January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1.  Understand the problem:**

*    Eve started with 20 pomelos. 
*    After giving some away, she has 1/4 of her original amount.

**2. Translate the problem into a mathematical expression:**

Let 'x' be the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

*  This leaves her with (20 - x) pomelos.
*  We know (20 - x) represents 1/4 of the original amount.

 {Math Expression} 
(20 - x) = (1/4) * 20 

**3. Solve the expression:**

* Simplify the fraction: (20 - x) = 5 
* Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: -x = -15

**4. Isolate x:**

 *  Multiply both sides by -1: x = 15


**5. The answer:** 

Eve gave away 15 pomelos. {The final answer is 15.}

* Number of classrooms: 80 
* Time per classroom: 15 minutes
* Total cleaning time per classroom: 15 minutes
 
**Step 2: Calculate total cleaning time required**
* Total cleaning time = (Number of classrooms) * (Time per classroom)

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer ; books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how to break it down:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   * Let 'b' represent the number of books on the bottom shelf.
   * Let 'm' represent the number of books on the middle shelves. 

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * We know that the bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf, so: b = 2m
   * We know that the top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf: b - 5 = m 

3. **Equation relating the total number of books:**
   * Since the total number of books is 110, we can use these inequalities to find the number of shelves and thus the number of bookcases: b + m + (b - 5) = 110
   
4. **Solve for b:**
   * Substitute the first two equations into the third to get an equation we can solve for b:
     2m + m + (2m - 5) = 110

5. **Solve for m:**
   * Simplify and combine terms:

                    question:
                    Rose bought five dozens ! of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. How much will be Rose's profit?<end_of_turn>
*Hint: Calculate the total number of eggs and the selling price per egg, then calculate the profit.
 


**Here's how I would solve the problem:**

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs.**

* One dozen has 12 eggs.
* Rose bought 5 dozens, so she has 5 * 12 = 60 eggs.

**Step 2: Calculate the selling price per egg.**

* She sells 3 eggs for $1.
* So, the selling price per egg is $1 / 3 = $0.33 (rounded to two decimal places). 

**Step 3: Calculate Rose's total selling price.**

*  She sells each egg for $0.33.
*  She has 60 eggs.
* Her total selling price is 60 * $0.33 = $19.80. 

**Step 4: Calculate Rose's profit.**

*  Her total cost was $2.40 * 5 dozen = $12.00 per dozen. 
*   Since she sold the eggs for $19.80, she made a profit of  $19.80 - $12.00 = $7.80

 {The final answer is $7.80.}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Find the number of red hats:**

* Half of his hats are red: 100 hats / 2 = 50 red hats

**2. Find the number of hats that are NOT red:**

* Total hats - red hats = non-red hats
* 100 hats - 50 red hats = 50 non-red hats

**3. Find the number of blue hats:**

* 3/5 of the non-red hats are blue: (3/5) * 50 hats = 30 blue hats

**4. Find the number of white hats:**

*  Non-red hats - blue hats = white hats
* 50 non-red hats - 30 blue hats = 20 white hats


**The final answer is 20 white hats.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.
The remaining number of hats which are not red is 100-50 = <<100-50=50>>50
3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, a total of 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30 hats
If the rest of the remaining hats are white, then there are 50-30 = <<50-30=20>>20 white hats.

Here's how we can find the answer:

**Step 1: Calculate the discount.**
* The price of the beef jerky is $18.00, and it's $3.00 off, so the discount is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

**Step 2: Calculate the price per stick.**
* Divide the total price by the number of sticks per bag: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50 per stick 

**Step 3: Convert the price to cents.** 
* There are 100 cents in a dollar. 
* Multiply the price per stick in dollars by 100: $0.50 x 100 cents = 50 cents 


{The final answer is 50 cents} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

She makes some strawberry . cubes, and a number of blueberry . cubes equal to 5 times the : number of strawberry cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is }

Step 1:  Define variables. 
Let: 
   *  `x` represent the number of strawberry ice cubes.

Step 2: Formulate an equation based on the given information.
The problem states that Mary makes 116 ice cubes total, and the number of strawberry cubes is `x`. The number of blueberries cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as an equation:  `x + 5x - 4 = 116` 

Step 3: Solve for the variable.
Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: `6x - 4 = 116`
Add 4 to both sides of the equation: `6x = 120` 
Divide both sides by 6: `x=20`

Step 4: Calculate the number of blueberry cubes.
Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, we can find this by substituting the value of `x` into the equation:
`5(20) - 4 = ?`
That is 100 - 4 = 96


{The final answer is}  96


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

**Understanding the Logic**

1. **Time for the First Side:**  We know John takes 5 minutes to get to the first side.

2. **Time for Side Two:**  The second and third sides both take twice the time as the first, meaning: 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.

3. **Time for Side Three:** Same logic as Side Two: 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.

4. **Time for the Last Two Sides:** The last two sides take half the time of the first, meaning: 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes. 

5. **Total Time:**  To find the total time, we add the time of each step: 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 = 37.5 minutes


**Final Answer is: 37.5 minutes.** 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

 time for 1 painting to dry
 


## Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Identify the key information:**
   *  Old varnish drying time: 7 minutes per painting 
   *  New varnish drying time: 12 minutes per painting
   *  Number of paintings: 6

2. **Calculate the difference in drying times:** 
   *  Difference = New drying time - Old drying time 
   *  Difference = 12 minutes - 7 minutes 
   *   Difference = 5 minutes

3. **Determine the additional time needed for six paintings:** 
   *  Additional time = Difference in drying times per painting * Number of painting 
   *  Additional time = 5 minutes * 6 
   *  Additional time = 30 minutes

4. **State the final answer:**
   *The new varnish will take 30 minutes longer to dry six paintings.  




Let me know if you need any further clarification.

* Step 1: Determine the number of plants needing half a cup.
* Step 2: Determine the number of plants needing one cup.
* Step 3: Determine the number of plants needing a quarter cup.
* Step 4: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing half a cup.
* Step 5: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing one cup.
* Step 6: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing a quarter cup.
* Step 7: Add the totals from Step 4, Step 5, and Step 6 to find the total cups of water Crista needs. {The final answer is}



Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

* **Step 1: Determine the number of plants needing half a cup.**
   -  4 plants need half a cup of water.

* **Step 2: Determine the number of plants needing one cup.**
   - 8 plants need one cup of water.

* **Step 3: Determine the number of plants needing a quarter cup.**
   - 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants need a quarter cup of water.

* **Step 4: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing half a cup.**
   -  4 plants * (1/2 cup/plant) = 2 cups of water

* **Step 5: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing one cup.**
   - 8 plants * (1 cup/plant) = 8 cups of water

* **Step 6: Calculate the total water needed for plants needing a quarter cup.**
   - 8 plants * (1/4 cup/plant) = 2 cups of water 


* **Step 7: Add the totals from Step 4, Step 5, and Step 6 to find the total cups of water Crista needs.**
   - 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water


{The final answer is} 12 cups of water. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups
She will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.
Since she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the distance on land:**
   - Phineas hopped 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards.
   - The question asks how long it will take Phineas to Hop.


2. **Calculate the distance in water:**
   - The remaining distance is 200 yards - 100 yards = 100 yards

3. **Calculate the time to hop:**
   -  The speed of hopping is 20 yards per minute. 
   -  To find the time, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

   -  Time = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes

4. **Calculate the time to swim:**
   - The speed of swimming is 10 yards per minute.
   - Time = Distance / Speed


    - Time = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes

5. **Calculate the total time:**
   -  Time (hopping) + Time (swimming) = Total time.
   -  5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes

 
**{The final answer is 15 minutes.}**



<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.
100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.
100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.
In total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.

**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

1. **Figure out how many boxes Bob will need:**
    * We need 56 popsicle sticks to build the monument.
    * Each box has 8 popsicle sticks.
    * To find out how many boxes he needs, divide the total popsicle sticks by the number in each box: 56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle sticks/box = 7 boxes.

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
    * Each box costs $2.00.
    * The total cost for all the boxes is the cost per box multiplied by the number of boxes: $2.00/box * 7 boxes = $14.00.



 **The final answer is:** $14.00 
<end_of_turn><eos>","He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes
Each box costs $2.00 and he needs 7 boxes so it will cost him 2*7 = $<<2*7=14.00>>14.00

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Determine the cost of one additional phone.**

* The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.
* If the main phone costs $20, then one additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.

**2. Calculate the cost of all the additional phones.**

* There are five additional phones. 
* The cost of all the additional phones is 5 * $10 = $50.

**3. Calculate the total cost of the phone plan.**

* The cost of the main phone is $20.
* The cost of all additional phones is $50.
* The total cost of the phone plan is $20 + $50 = $70.


{The final answer is $70} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts:**

* A dozen has 12 doughnuts.
* Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts, so he makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.

**2. Calculate the daily earnings:**

*  Derrick sells each doughnut for $2.
* He makes 120 doughnuts per day, so he makes 120 * $2 = $240 per day.

**3. Calculate the total earnings for June:**

* June has 30 days.
*  Derrick makes $240 per day, so he makes $240 * 30 = $7200 for June.


**The final answer is $7200** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200

She wants to upload all her photos on : her Instagram. If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, how many days will she need to upload all of her photos?<end_of_turn>


Here's the solution:

1. **Calculate the total uploads in one day:**
   - Jade uploads 7 photos per batch.
   - She uploads 6 batches each day.
   - Total uploads in one day = 7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day. 

2. **Determine the total uploading days:**
   - Total photos = 210
   - Photos per day = 42
   - Total days to upload = Total photos / Photos per day = 210 / 42 = 5 days.

**The final answer is 5 days**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Numbers at Day 2:**

* The next day, 20 more people were present than day 1. 
* So, on day 2, 50 + 20 = 70 people were at the beach.

**2. Numbers at Day 3:**

* Day 3 had twice the people of day 2.
* So, day 3 had 70 * 2 = 140 people at the beach.

**3. Total People at Each Day:**

* We know Conor saw an average of 60 people everyday. 
* So, over the 4 days, the total number seen is 60 * 4 = 240 people


{The final answer is 240} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people
The third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people
For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people
Conor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people

How many pieces of popcorn does Garrett have to eat?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of kernels popped in the second 30 seconds**

* The kernels pop three times faster in the next 30 seconds than the first 30 seconds (20 kernels). 
* 3 * 20 kernels = 60 kernels

**Step 2: Calculate the number of kernels popped in the third 30 seconds**

* Kernels pop four times faster in the third 30 seconds than the second 30 seconds (60 kernels).

**Step 3: Calculate the number of kernels popped in the final 30 seconds**

* The number of kernels popped is initially at 240 kernels.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of kernels popped from residual heat**

* A quarter of the kernels popped in the final 30 seconds (240 kernels) pop from residual heat.
* 240 kernels / 4 = 60 kernels 

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of kernels popped**

* The total number of kernels popped in all the cooking stages is 240 + 60 = 300 kernels

**Final Answer: The final answer is 300** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Find out how much fresh lemon juice Tim needs:**

* He needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon of lemonade.
* He plans to make 4 gallons.
*  Amount of juice needed: 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice.

**2. Determine how many lemons he needs for 1 cup of juice:**
* 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. 

**3. Find out how many lemons he needs for 4 cups of juice:**

* 4 cups of juice / 1 cup juice per 6 lemons = 2/3 cup of lemons.
* To get the precise number of lemons, we need to figure out how many lemons he needs to get 4 cups of juice

**4. Calculate the number of lemons needed for his original lemonade recipe.**

* 2/3 cup of lemons * 6 lemons/1 cup = 4 lemons.

**5. Find out how many lemons he needs for the extra gallon.**
* Twice as tart requires more lemons

**6. Find how many lemons you need for 1 cup of juice.**


**{The final answer is 4 lemons} ** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

   -  Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs. 
   -  Total legs for 2-legged animals: 10 animals * 2 legs/animal = 20 legs.

**2. Count the total legs for 4-legged animals:**
   - We know there are 15 4-legged animals.
   - Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
   - Total legs for 4-legged animals: 15 animals * 4 legs/animal = 60 legs.

**3. Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Total legs on the farm: 20 legs (2-legged) + 60 legs (4-legged) = 80 legs.




**The final answer is:** 80 
<end_of_turn><eos>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs
4-legged animals have 4 legs. Therefore 15 4-legged animals will have 15*4=<<15*4=60>>60 legs
In total there are 20+60= <<20+60=80>>80 legs
A pair of legs equals 2 legs. If there are 80 legs on the farm, there will be 80/2= <<80/2=40>>40 pairs of legs

{The final answer is}
    

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let 'b' represent the number of blue blocks.
   * Let 'y' represent the number of yellow blocks.
   * Let 'r' represent the number of red blocks.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   * We know that b + y + r = 32 (The total number of blocks is 32)
   * We know that y = 2b (Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks)

3. **Solve for a Variable:**
   * Substitute the second equation (y = 2b) into the first equation: b + 2b + r = 32
   * Simplify: 3b + r = 32 

4. **Solve for the Remaining Variable:**
   * Now we need to isolate 'r'.  We can use the equation 3b + r = 32 
   * Subtract 3b from both sides: r = 32 - 3b


5. **Final Solution:**
   *Substitute the value of 'y' from the original equation into the solution of 'r': 
  *r = 32 - 3b 

*We don't have enough information to tell the exact number of red blocks.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* Elvis drives west for 5 hours at a constant speed of 18 mph. 
* He then turns around and travels east for 8 hours at a constant speed of 18 mph. 
* We need to find out the distance from his house now.

**2. Determine the Distance Travelled West**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance = 18 mph x 5 hours = 90 miles

**3. Determine the Distance Travelled East**

*  Distance = Speed x Time
*  Distance = 18 mph x 8 hours = 144 miles

**4. Find the Total Distance Traveled**

*  Total Distance = Distance West + Distance East 
*  Total Distance = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles


**5. Find the Final Location** 


*  We are looking for the distance from his house, so this is what we must find


**6. Use a Route to Estimate His Location**

* Using a map or geographical resource, we can plot out a possible route for this scenario
 

{The final answer is 234 miles} 


 

<end_of_turn><eos>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles
Then he travels east at the same speed for 8 hours so he covered a distance of 8*18 = <<8*18=144>>144 miles
His distance from his house now is the difference between his east and west movements which is 144-90 = <<144-90=54>>54 miles

**2. Determine total cost of the hotel:**

*  The cost of the hotel for 3 nights is $80 * 3 = $240

**3. Calculate the total cost of all the bus trips:**

*  Helen took 7 bus trips, so the total cost is $8/trip * 7 trips = $56 

**4. Calculate the total cost of Helen's trip:**

*  The total cost is $240 (hotel) + $56 (bus) = $296


 {The final answer is $296} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total weight of the luggage and children.**

   * Luggage weight: 250 pounds
   * Children's weight: 75 pounds/child * 2 children = 150 pounds
   * Total weight: 250 pounds + 150 pounds = 400 pounds

**2. Calculate the total weight of the car and luggage.**

* Total weight: 1200 pounds + 400 pounds = 1600 pounds

**3. Calculate the force needed to move the car.**

 * Force = 1% of total weight
 * Force = (1/100) * 1600 pounds 
 * Force = 16 pounds

Here's the solution:
1. **Understand the problem:** We need to find out how much crepe paper is needed to wrap around the entire perimeter of James's fence. 
2. **Identify the shape:** James' backyard fence is a rectangle.
3. **Recall the perimeter formula:** The perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance around its outside.  It can be calculated using the following formula:
    Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
4. **Apply the formula:**
   *  length = 20 feet
   *  width = 15 feet 
   *  Perimeter = 2 * (20 + 15) 
5. **Solve for the perimeter:** 
    * Perimeter = 2 * (35)
    * Perimeter = 70 feet
     
{The final answer is 70 feet.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet

 **Solution:**
1. **Identify the key information:** 
   - Mia's age: 40 years old
   - Age difference between Mia and Emma: 16 years 

2. **Determine Emma's age:**
   - By knowing Mia's age and their age difference, we can find Emma's age. 
   - Emma's age = Mia's age + Age difference
   - Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

3. **Calculate the average age:**
   - To find the average age, add the ages of both Mia and Emma and divide by 2. 
   - Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age)/2 
   - Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
   - Average age = 96 / 2
   - Average age = 48

*
Solution:
1. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.** 
    * John invited 20 people.
    * Each guest needs 2 hot dogs.
    * Therefore, he needs 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs.
2. **Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs needed.**
    * He needs 40 hot dogs.
    * A pack has 6 hot dogs.
    * Therefore, he needs 40 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6.67 packs of hot dogs.
3. **Calculate the total cost.**
    * Each pack costs $2.
    * He needs 6.67 packs.
    * Therefore, the total cost is 6.67 packs * $2/pack = $13.34{

**Answer:** He needs to spend $13.34 on hot dogs. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He needs 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 hot dogs
So he needs another 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 hot dogs
So he needs to buy 36/6=<<36/6=6>>6 packs of hotdogs
That means he needs to spend 6*2=$<<6*2=12>>12

                    question:
                    Frances : sells 20 cupcakes for $2 for each cupcake and  40 ;  cookies at $1 each.  She buys five trays at $4 ? for each tray. How much money does Frances have left?<end_of_turn>
cupcake money = 20 cupcakes x $2/cupcake = {The final answer is}

 cookie money = 40 cookies x $1/cookie = {The final answer is}

tray money = 5 trays x $4/tray = {The final answer is}

total money = cupcake money + cookie money + tray money = {The final answer is}


{The final answer is}


## Detailed reasoning:

* **Step 1:**  Determine the earnings from cupcake sales. 
    * Frances earns $2 per cupcake multiplied by the number of cupcakes sold.
    * Earnings from cupcakes = 20 cupcakes * $2/cupcake = $40
   
* **Step 2:** Determine the earnings from cookie sales.
    * Frances earns $1 per cookie multiplied by the number of cookies sold.
    * Earnings from cookies = 40 cookies * $1/cookie = $40

* **Step 3:** Determine the earnings from tray purchases.
    * Frances earns $4 per tray multiplied by the number of trays purchased.
    * Earnings from trays = 5 trays * $4/tray = $20

* **Step 4:** Calculate Frances’ total earnings. 
    * Total earnings = earnings from cupcakes + earnings from cookies + earnings from trays
    * Total earnings = $40 + $40 + $20 = $100


* **Conclusion:**
    * Frances has $100 left. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.
So, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.
The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many , children are now following the truck?<end_of_turn>
*

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1.  Initial Children:**

   * Start with 5 children following the truck.

**2. Second Street:**

   * Each child joins another, meaning each child gets an additional child. 
   * 5 children * 2 = 10 new children 
   * Total children: 5 (original) + 10 (new) = 15 children

**3. Third Street:**

   * Each original child joins 2 more, making a total of 5 children + 2*5= 15 children
       

**4. Final Group:**

   *  The original 5 children give up. 
   *   Total children: 15 children - 5 children =  10 children


{The final answer is 10} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

On the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.
After the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.

2. **Calculate the remaining meals:**
   - Subtract the total meals distributed from the initial number of meals to be distributed.

Here's how we can figure out the total value of James's change:

**1. Value of a Quarter**
   * A quarter is worth $0.25.
   * So, 1 quarter is worth 25 cents.

**2. Value of Two Nickels**
   * Each nickel is worth $0.05
   * So, 2 nickels are worth 2 * 0.05 = 0.10 cents. 

**3. Value of Seven Dimes**
   * Each dime is worth $0.10
   * So, 7 dimes are worth 7 * 0.10 = 0.70 cents.

**4. Calculate the Total**
  * Add up the value of each piece of change: 25 cents + 0.10 cents + 0.70 cents = {The final answer is} 35.80 cents
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents
Then figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine the age of the older brother:**

* One of the brothers is half the age of the older brother. 
* Therefore, the older brother's age is 12 years * 2 = 24 years old.

**2. Find the age of the sisters:**

* The sisters are all the same age, and we know one of them is 16 years old.
* Therefore, the ages of the sisters are 16 years old.

**3. Calculate the total age for all siblings:**

* Total age of the elder brother: 24 years old
* Total age of the female sisters: 3 sisters * 16 years old = 48 years old
* Total age of the younger brother: 12 years old

* Total age of all siblings = 24 years old + 48 years old + 12 years old = 84 years old




{The final answer is 84 years old} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

**4. Calculate the total money left for the movies:**
   * $18 - $5.00 = $13.00

**5. Calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy:**
   * $13.00 / $6.50/ticket = 2 movies

**The final answer is:** Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate Ellen's purchases:**

*  Leggings: $100
*  Photo frame: $5
*  Ellen's total: $100 + $5 = $105 

**2. Calculate Lani's purchases:**

*  Sunglasses: $30
*  Bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
*  Lani's total: $30 + $200 = $230

**3.  Calculate the total amount spent:**

*  Ellen's total + Lani's total: $105 + $230 = $335


{The final answer is $335} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.
Two bathrobes cost 2 x $100 = $<<2*100=200>>200.
So, Lani spent $30 +$200 =$<<30+200=230>>230.
Therefore, they spent $105 + $230 = $<<105+230=335>>335 in all.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the two halves of the collection:** The buyer wants to pay half the price of the collection at $5 per toy and the other half at $7 per toy.

2. **Calculate the earnings from each half of the collection:** 
   - Earnings from the $5 per toy side of the collection: 12 toy soldiers * ($5/soldier) = $60.
   - Earnings from the $7 per toy side of the collection: 12 toy soldiers * ($7/soldier) = $84.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:** Add the earnings from both sides of the collection.  
   - Total earnings = $60 + $84 = $144.


**The final answer is $144**<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.

**Here's how to solve the problem:**

1. **Calculate total holes dug:**
   -  Nate's dog digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes
2. **Calculate holes dug per night:**
   - Nate's dog digs 6 new holes/night
3. **Calculate total holes dug after Nate gets home:**

4. **Calculate time to fill all the holes:**
   - 168 holes / 9 holes/day = 18.67 days.


**Final answer: It will take Nate 18.67 days to fill in all the holes**

How much greater is the average enrollment at Norman High School than the enrollment at Butler High School?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.**

*  We know Norman High School has an average of 4000 students.
*  Butler High School has 3/4 the number of students as Norman High School.

*  We can set up a proportion: 4000 students / 1 = x students / 4

**2. Solve for the average enrollment at Butler High School (x).**

*  Multiplying both sides by 4: 4000 students * 4 = x
*  This simplifies to: 16000 students = x 

**3. Determine the difference in enrollment.**

*  We know Norman High School has 4000 students and Butler High School has 16000 students.
*  The difference is: (4000 students - 16000 students)

**4. Calculate the difference.**

*  = 4000 - 16000 = -12000

**5. Determine the difference in enrollment in words.**

*  The difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School is 12000 students


{The final answer is 12000}

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of test tubes Igor originally collected. 
   * Let 'y' represent the number of Petri dishes Igor collected.
  
2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * ""Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested""
      *  x = (1/2) * 16

4. **Use the information from step 3 to solve for the missing number:**
    * The total number of beakers is unknown, but we know that x is 8 and y is 10, therefore, the total number of beakers should be calculated. 

5. **Determine the number of beakers lost based on the equation:**
   * *Note:  We already know the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes. We now only need to calculate how many beakers he lost.


{The final answer is 1}

If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes . did Vanessa take to complete her part?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
   *  Let 'x' represent the distance Aaron ran in miles.
   *  Let 'y' represent the distance Vanessa ran in miles. 

2. **Set up relationships based on the given information:**
   * We know Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa,  so: x / 2 = y
   * We know Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so: y = 2x.

3. **Now we know:**
   * From the relationships in step 2 we can see that 2x = y.
4. **Use the given information to translate into an equation for Vanessa’s time:**
    * Vanessa ran 4 miles, so that can be represented as: y = 4

5. **Substitute to solve for Vanessa's speed:**
    * We now know the values of y and use the equation 2x=y to substitute to solve for x.
6. **Substitute into the original equation to determine Vanessa’s time:** 
    * Vanessa ran twice the distance of Aaron, and we know Aaron ran 16 minutes.


{The final answer is} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.
Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes for each mile.
She ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Determine the total line needed per foot of dock.**

* The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every 1 foot of dock.

**2. Calculate the total line needed for 200 feet of dock.**

*  He needs 3 feet of line per foot of dock, so he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line. 

**3. Account for the existing line.**

* He already has 6 feet of line. 


**4. Calculate the total line needed to be purchased.**

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the meals:**
   - They order 2 meals * $5/meal = $10/meal 
2. **Calculate the total cost of the meals:**
   - $10/meal * 2 meals = $20/night
3. **Calculate the total daily cost:**
   - $20/night + $5/bottle = $25/night
4. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   -  $25/night * 2 nights = $50/week
5. **Calculate their total weekly revenue:**
   - $50/week + $5 from the wine = $55/week The final answer is $55

                    A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them : at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the profit earned.**

*   Profit percentage = 25%
*   Profit amount = 25/100 * $80 = $20 

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost.**

*   Total cost = Cost of watermelons
*   Total cost = $80


**Step 3: Calculate the selling price.**

*   Selling price = Total cost + Profit amount
*   Selling price = $80 + $20 = $100 

**Step 4:  Calculate the price per watermelon.**

*   Price per watermelon = Selling price / Number of watermelons
*   Price per watermelon = $100 / 50 = $2

{The final answer is $2} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

*This question focuses on age comparisons and a little time perspective.*

**Solution:**
1. **Find James's current age:** 
   - Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is currently 12-3 = 9 years old.
   - James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 9 * 2 = 18 years old.

2. **Find John's age:**
   - James is 18 years old, and he was born when John was 19. 
   - So, John is 18-19 = -1 year old
   
3. ** Determine the age of John's youngest son:**
   - John's youngest son was born when he was 32, so he is currently 32 years old.

4. **Calculate the youngest son's age in 3 years:**
   - John's youngest son will be 32 + 3 = {35} years old

 


**Final answer is 35 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?<end_of_turn>
 


Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Figure out how many oranges they peel in an hour:**

* An hour has 60 minutes.
* Ana peels 1 orange every 3 minutes, so in an hour she will peel 1/3 * 60 = 20 oranges.
* Jane peels 1 orange every 4 minutes, so in an hour she will peel 1/4 * 60 = 15 oranges.

**2. Compare the number of oranges peeled:**

* Ana will peel 20 oranges.
* Jane will peel 15 oranges.
* The difference is 20 - 15 = 5 oranges.


**3. State the final answer:**

                    question:
                    Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 . legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step by step:

**1. Define variables:**

*  Let 'c' be the number of chickens. 
*  Let 'v' be the number of cows.

**2. Formulate equations:**

* **Equation 1 (total number of animals):**  c + v = 20 
* **Equation 2 (total number of legs):** 2c + 4v = 70  (Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4)

**3. Solve for one variable in terms of the other:**

* From equation 1, we can isolate 'c':
   c = 20 - v

**4. Substitute the isolated variable into the second equation:**

* Substitute (20 - v) for 'c' in Equation 2:
   2(20 - v) + 4v = 70

**5. Simplify and solve for 'v':**

* Expand Equation: 40 - 2v + 4v = 70
    * Combine 'v' terms: 40 + 2v = 70
    * Subtract 40 from both sides: 2v = 30
    * Divide both sides by 2: v = 15

**6. Solve for 'c':**

* Substitute the value of 'v' back into Equation 1:
   c + 15 = 20
* Subtract 15 from both sides: c = 5

 


**7. Answer:**
 
The number of chickens is {5}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5
