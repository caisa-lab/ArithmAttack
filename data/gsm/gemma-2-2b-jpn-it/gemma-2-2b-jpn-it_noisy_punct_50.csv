                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning ; and bakes muffins for her friends every ? day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market , daily for $2 per ? fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the : farmers' market?<end_of_turn>
  


Here's a breakdown of each step in the solution:

**1. Calculate the number of eggs left after breakfast:**
   * Start with: 16 eggs per day
   * Subtract breakfast consumption:  16 - 3 = 13 eggs

**2. Determine how many eggs per day are sold:**
    *  Start with: 13 eggs per day
    *  Selling price: $2 per egg

**3. Calculate the daily earnings:**
    *  Multiply number of eggs sold by selling price: 13 eggs * $2/egg = $26 per day


**Answer:** The final answer is $26. 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

*The problem is asking for the total number of bolts needed to make the robe. 

**Step 1:  Break down the information  into different parts.**
The robe needs: 
* 2 bolts of blue fiber
* Half that amount of white fiber

**Step 2:  Find the amount of white fiber.** 
* We need half the amount of blue fiber, so we divide the number of blue fibers by 2.
* (2 bolts of blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber


**Step 3:  Find the total number of bolts.** 
* Add the number of blue bolts and the number of white bolts together. 
* 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts.


**The final answer is 3 bolts. } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the initial cost of the house:** Josh bought the house for $80,000.
2. **Determine the total investment:** He put in $50,000 for repairs. 
3. **Calculate the value of the house after the repairs:**  The house's value increased by 150%, meaning the value is 1.5 times the initial cost.
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the initial investment from the renovated value:** The new value is 1.5 times the original cost, so:  
   * Profit = Renovated value - Initial cost
   * Profit = 1.5 * $80,000 - $80,000
   * Profit= $120,000 - $80,000
   * Profit = $40,000. 




{The final answer is $40,000} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000
So he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000

**Here's the breakdown of the solution:**

1. **Identify the Key Information:**
   - Wendi's flock has 20 chickens.
   - Each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per meal.
   - Morning meal: 15 cups
   - Afternoon meal: 25 cups 
2. **Calculate Total Cups for the First Two Meals:**
   - Total cups for morning and afternoon: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups
3. **Determine the Amount Needed in the Final Meal:**
   - Total cups needed for all meals: 40 cups
   -  Amount needed for final meal: 40 cups – 40 cups = 0 cups
 

 
**Final Answer:** {She needs 0 cups of feed for the final meal.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.

**Problem:**
Kylar went to the store to buy glasses for his new apartment. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much does he need to pay for them?

**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
    * Let `x` represent the price of a regular glass. 
    * Let `y` represent the price of a second glass.
2. **Write an equation based on given information: **
    * We know that a regular glass costs $5:  x = 5
    * We know that each second glass costs 60% of the regular glass's price: y = 0.60x 
    * We know Kylar is buying 16 glasses:  16 = x + y
3. **Substitute the values into the equation:**
    * 16 = 5 + 0.60(5)
4. **Simplify the equation:**
    * 16 = 5 + 3
    * 16 = 8
5. **Check for validity:**
    * The equation doesn't hold.
  
**Final answer:** I made an error in my reasoning, and the final answer is incorrect.




<end_of_turn><eos>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Find how many sheep Charleston has:**

* Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which has 20.
* Charleston has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

**2. Find how many sheep Toulouse has:**

* Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which has 80.
* Toulouse has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

**3. Find the total number of sheep for all three cities:**

* Toulouse has 160 sheep.
* Charleston has 80 sheep.
* Seattle has 20 sheep.
* Together, they have 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.


 {The final answer is 260 sheep.} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

1. **Calculate the initial download progress:**
   - Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute.
   - The file is 200 GB in size.
   - We need to consider the time for the download, given the initial download rate.

2. **Calculate the time taken for the initial download:**
   -  There are no calculations in the problem statement for the initial download time.


3. **Account for the restart and remaining download time:**
   - Because of the restart, Carla begins at the beginning of the download.

He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first 3 hours:** 
   - Distance = Speed × Time 
   - Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours 
   - Distance = 180 miles

2. **Calculate the distance travelled during the standstill traffic:**
   - Time spent in standstill traffic = 2 hours
   - Distance traveled in standstill = 0 miles. This is because there is no movement in this segment. 

3. **Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph:**
   - Time spent driving at 30 mph = 0.5 hours (half an hour).
   - Distance traveled at 30 mph = 30 mph × 0.5 hours

4. **Calculate the distance travelled at 80 mph remaining:**
    - Time spent driving at 80 mph = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours
    - Distance traveled at 80 mph = 80 mph × 2.5 hours


5. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
  - Total distance = Distance traveled in first 3 hours + Distance in standstill + Distance traveling at 30 mph + Distance traveling at 80 mph 


**Final Answer:** {The total distance traveled is 240 miles.}

 

<end_of_turn><eos>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours
In half an hour he goes 30*.5=<<30*.5=15>>15 miles
He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles
So he is 180-135=<<180-135=45>>45 miles away from home

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate regular hourly earnings**

*  Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
*  She works 40 hours at this rate.
*  Regular earnings = $10/hour * 40 hours = $400

**Step 2: Calculate overtime earnings**

*  Overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
*  1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour 
*  Eliza worked an extra 5 hours (45 hours - 40 hours) 
*  Overtime earnings = $12/hour * 5 hours = $60

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings**

*  Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
*  Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460 


{The final answer is $460} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.

Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

downloads in the second month
     


Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Downloads in the second month:**

* The number of downloads in the second month was three times those in the first month.
* So, the downloads in the second month were 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.

**2. Downloads in the third month:**

*  The downloads were reduced by 30% in the third month.
* Calculate the decrease: 30/100 * 180 = 54 downloads
*  Downloads in the third month were 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

**3.  Total downloads:**

* Add the downloads in each month: 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads


{The final answer is 366} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.
In the three months, the total number of downloads of the program was 126+240 = <<126+240=366>>366

* The question contains errors in punctuation and word choices. It needs to be formatted for clarity. 
 


Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Identify the Costs**

* **Donuts:** 3 dozen donuts * $68/dozen = $204 
* **Mini Cupcakes:** 2 dozen mini cupcakes * $80/dozen = $160
* **Mini Cheesecakes:** 6 dozen mini cheesecakes * $55/dozen = $330

**2. Calculate the Total Cost**

* Total Cost = Cost of Donuts + Cost of Mini Cupcakes + Cost of Mini Cheesecakes
* Total Cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $794

**The final answer is $794**

It costs $3 a year to water and ? feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts : earning money on ; the ? lemon tree?<end_of_turn>
  
Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate annual revenue.**

* Sell price per lemon: $1.50
* Number of lemons per year: 7
* Annual revenue per lemon: $1.50 x 7 = $10.50

**Step 2: Calculate annual cost.**

* Planting cost: $90.00
* Yearly watering and feeding cost: $3.00
* Total annual cost: $90.00 + $3.00 = $93.00

**Step 3: Determine the net profit per year.**

* Annual revenue: $10.50
* Annual cost: $93.00
* Net profit per year: $10.50 - $93.00 = -$82.50

**Step 4: Analyze net profit.**

* The net profit is -$82.50.
 *  This means that Carlos is losing $82.50 per year.

**Step 5: Determine the number of years**

*To see how long it takes to begin earning, we need to figure out when the annual revenue will exceed the annual cost.


**Final Answer:** It will take at least **one year** to start earning money.


<end_of_turn><eos>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

**2. Set Up Equations:**

* **Green house:** (1/3)x = 5 
* **Red house:**  (2/1)x =  ?  (We don't know the exact number of vacuum cleaners sold to the red house.
* **Orange house:**  (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - (2/1)x) = ? (We don't know the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house.
    
**3. Solve for 'x' :**

* We need to find out the original value of x.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Students enrolled in contemporary dance**
* Multiply the total number of students by the percentage enrolled in contemporary dance: 20 students * 0.20 = 4 students 

**Step 2: Students remaining after contemporary dance**
* Subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students: 20 students - 4 students = 16 students

**Step 3: Students enrolled in jazz dance**
* Multiply the number of students remaining by the percentage enrolled in jazz dance: 16 students * 0.25 = 4 students

**Step 4: Students remaining after contemporary and jazz dance**
* Subtract the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students: 16 students - 4 students = 12 students

**Step 5: Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance**
* Divide the number of students in hip-hop dance by the total number of students, and then multiply by 100 to express the percentage: 12 students / 20 students * 100 = 60%



 {The final answer is 60% } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem and solution:

**1. Define the variables**

*  Let `x` represent the amount the merchant invests in jewelry. 
*  Let `y` represent the amount the merchant invests in electronic gadgets. 

**2. Set up the Profit Equations**
*  **Profit from Jewelry:**  `profit_jewelry = x * 1.025` (Because the jewelry market increases by 2.5%)
*  **Profit from Electronic Gadgets:** `profit_gadgets = y * 1.012` (Because the electronic gadgets market increases by 1.2%)

**3. The Total Profit:**
*  `total_profit = profit_jewelry + profit_gadgets`

**Solution:**

1. **Eggs per week:**
   - Claire eats 3 eggs per omelet.
   - She makes 3 omelets per day. 
   - Total eggs per day: 3 eggs/omelet * 3 omelets/day = 9 eggs/day
   - Total eggs per week: 9 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 63 eggs/week

2. **Dozens per week:**
   -  A dozen eggs is 12 eggs.
   -  Dozens per week: 63 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 5.25 dozen/week

3. **Dozens over 4 weeks:**
   - Dozens over 4 weeks: 5.25 dozen/week * 4 weeks = 21 dozen


**The final answer is 21 dozen.**

*Hint:* You might need to use a calculator

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the initial proportion of water in the orange drink:** 
   - Two-thirds of orange drink is water, so (2/3) * 10 liters = 6.67 liters of water. 
2. **Calculate the initial proportion of water in the pineapple drink:** 
   - Three-fifths of pineapple drink is water, so (3/5) * 15 liters = 9 liters of water.
3. **Calculate the total initial water content in the combined drinks:** 
   - 6.67 liters (orange) + 9 liters (pineapple) = 15.67 liters of water
4. **Account for the spill:**
   -  We spill 1 liter of orange drink, so subtract 1
   - The total water content becomes 15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters.
5. **Calculate the water content in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink:** 
   - 14.67 liters of water represents 14.67/24 = 0.61 (rounded to 4 decimal places) 

**The final answer is 0.61** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

{The final answer is}



Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Set up the variables:**

* Let  'x' be the original price of the book.

**2. Express the discount in terms of the original price:**

*  A 25% discount means that Kyle paid 75% of the original price (100% - 25% = 75%).

**3. Form an equation:**

*  Kyle paid $19.50 which is 75% of the original price, so: 0.75x = $19.50

**4. Solve for x (the original price):**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

*Hint:* Use a variable to represent the distance of the first stop.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Define the variables.**

* Let 'x' represent the distance traveled between his first stop and his second stop.


**Step 2:  Set up the equation:**

*  The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance of the first stop and the distance of his second stop. 
*  This can be written as:  Distance traveled in 1st stop + distance traveled in 2nd stop = total distance

* We know the total distance is 60 miles.
* We know the distance of his first stop is x
* We know the distance of his second stop is 15 miles


**Step 3:  Write the complete equation:**

* x + 15 = 60  


**Step 4:  Solve for x:**

* Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation.
*   x = 45


**Step 5:  Answer:**
*  Thus, Henry traveled **45** miles between his first and second stops. {The final answer is 45} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.

*


**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the price of one pair of boots.

2. **State the budget constraint:**
   * The cost of the heels is $33 plus $2 * $33  = $66.
   * This cost must be less than the cost of the boots. Therefore,  x < $33 + $66
2. **Set up the inequalities**:
   * The cost of the boots is less than the cost of the heels. So we can write the equation:
     * x < $33 + $66


3. **Solve the inequality:**
    * x < $99

4. **Determine the price of the boot**
     * The boots are priced at a number less than $99 {The final answer is less than $99} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.

**Solution:**

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Ratio:** 
   - The ratio 7:11 means that for every 7 units in Darrell's age, Allen's age is represented by 11 units. This means the ages are proportional to each other.

2. **Represent the Ages:**
   - Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x. 

3. **Set up the Equation:** 
   - We know their total age is 162. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     7x + 11x = 162
   - Combining like terms:
     18x = 162

4. **Solve for x:**
    - Divide both sides of the equation by 18 to isolate x.
     x = 9

5. **Calculate Darrell's Age:**
    -  Darrell's age is 7x, so substitute the value of x:
      Darrell's age = 7 * 9 = 63

6. **Calculate Allen's Age:**
    - Allen's age is 11x, so substitute the value of x:
      Allen's age = 11 * 9 = 99


7. **Calculate Allen’s Age 10 years from now:**
    - Allen's age now is 99. In 10 years, his age will be:
      99 + 10 = 109

 {The final answer is 109 }  
 


 Let me know if you need further clarification. <end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Finding the second friend's guess**

* Half of the first friend's guess (80) is 80 / 2 = 40.
* The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of the first friend's guess, so they think there are 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.

**Step 2: Finding the third friend's guess**

* 25% more than the first friend's guess (80) is 80 * 0.25 = 20 jelly beans.

**Step 3: Find the total number of jelly beans guessed**

* The second friend thinks there are 60 jelly beans.
* The third friend thinks there are 20 jelly beans.
* The total number of guesses combined is 60 + 20 + 20 = 100

**Step 4: Calculate the average guess**

* The average guess is the total number of guesses divided by the number of friends.


{The final answer is}:  100 / 3 = 33.33

Here's how we can step by step solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent his speed in miles per hour. 
 
**2. Set up equations based on given information:**

* **Day 1:** Distance = Speed * Time
   * We know he runs for 3 hours.
   * Distance = x * 3
* **Day 2 & 3:** Distance = Speed * Time
    * We know he runs 1/2 the time of day 1, so time is 3 hours / 2 = 1.5 hours
   * Distance = x * 1.5


**3. Combine the information:**

* **Total distance:**  60 miles (total distance per week) = x * 3 + x * 1.5 

**4. Solve for Speed (x):**

* Combine like terms: 60 = 4.5x 
* Isolate x:  x = 60 / 4.5
* Calculate x:  x = 13.33 (rounded to two decimal places)




**Final Answer:**   {The final answer is 13.33 miles per hour}

**Solution:**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the problem:

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'r' represent Dana's walking rate (miles per hour).
   * Let 'r_run' represent Dana's running rate (miles per hour). 
   * Let 's' represent Dana's skipping rate (miles per hour)

2. **Set up equations based on the information given:**
   *  ""Dana can run at a rate four times faster than she can walk"":  r_run = 4r 
   * ""She can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run"": s = (1/2)r_run

3. **Set up an equation for how long Dana spends on each activity:**
   *  ""One-third of the time she spends running and two-thirds of the time walking"": (1/3) * (r_run) + (2/3) * r

4. **Determine Dana's distance traveled during the six-hour period.**

   *  ""Dana can travel 3 miles per hour when skipping""
     * Dana travels at rate s for six hours: 6s  = 6*(1/2)r_run  = 3r_run
     * Therefore, Dana travels a total of 3r_run.

 

**Final Answer:**  {Dana can travel 18 miles}


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Polly : could ! throw the gold javelin, the ; only known weapon that . could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of , 400 ? feet, well within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But ; when Polly . held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times . farther than when not holding ? the gemstone. : If holding the gemstone, how ! far ! outside of the . reach of the dragon's flames could Polly stand and still hit the dragon with the : gold javelin?<end_of_turn>
* **Step 1:** Identify the given information in the problem.  
* **Step 2:** Define variables.
* **Step 3:**  Set up an equation to solve for the unknown distance.
* **Step 4:** Solve for the distance.
* **Step 5:** Provide the final answer.

Let's start!


**Step 1**: Identify the given information in the problem. 
   *  Perg the great dragon, breathes fire over a 1000 feet radius. 
   * Polly, can throw the gold javelin 400 feet.
   * The sapphire gemstone gives Polly an advantage: she can throw the javelin 3 times farther when she holds the gem. 

**Step 2**: Define variables
   * Let _x_ represent the distance from Perg's flames where Polly can throw the javelin.

**Step 3:**  Set up an equation to solve for the unknown distance.
    * Polly's range is limited by the dragon's flames.  
    * Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
    * With the sapphire gemstone, Polly's javelin can travel 3 times farther.
      
**Step 4:** Solve for the distance.
   
   * The solution needs to take into account how far the gemstone effect extends.


**Step 5:** Provide the final answer


<end_of_turn><eos>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.
1200 feet is beyond the 1000-foot reach of the dragon's flames by a distance of 1200-1000=<<1200-1000=200>>200 feet.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the known information:**
    * Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
    * Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
    *  There were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

2. **Set up an equation:**
    * To find the number of pieces taken by guests, we need to do a little math. 
    * We know the total number of pies and how many pieces are in each pie.  
    * We can set up the equation: Total pies * pieces/pie = Total pie pieces taken.

3. **Plug in known information:**
    * 5 pie * 8 pieces/pie = Total pie pieces taken

4. **Solve for the unknown:**
    * 40 pieces = Total pie pieces taken

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the calories from 5 servings.**

*   Each serving has 250 calories.
*   Total calories from 5 servings: 250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

**Step 2: Determine the remaining calorie allowance.**

*   Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
*   Calories already consumed: 1800 calories
*   Remaining calories allowance: 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories 

**Step 3: Calculate the grams of chips you can eat.**

*   Chips have 1250 calories per serving. 
*    Grams of chips you can eat: (200 calories / 250 calories/serving) = 0.8 servings

**Step 4: Calculate the grams of chips you can eat within your remaining calorie allowance.**

*   Chips have 250 calories per serving.
*   Grams of chips you can eat: 0.8 servings * 250 calories/serving = 200 grams

**Step 5: Final Answer**
 
The final answer is 200g 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

If he sells each candle ; for ; $2.00 each, what is his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of ingredients per candle:**

* He uses 1 pound of beeswax for 10 candles. 
* Cost per pound: $10.00
* Cost per candle: $10.00 / 10 candles = $1.00 per candle.

**2. Calculate his revenue per candle:**

* He sells each candle for $2.00.

**3. Calculate his total revenue from selling 20 candles:**

* Total revenue: 20 candles * $2.00/candle = $40.00

**4. Calculate his total cost for making and selling 20 candles.**

* Cost per candle: $1.00
* Total cost: 20 candles * $1.00/candle = $20.00

**5. Calculate his net profit:**

* Net profit: Total Revenue - Total Cost = $40.00 -$20.00 = $20.00



{The final answer is $20.00} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00

**Solution:**

1. **Tuesday's Articles:**
   - Meredith wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. 
   - This can be represented as: (2/5) * 5 articles
   - This simplifies to 2 articles.

2. **Wednesday's Articles:**
   - On Wednesday, Meredith wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - 2 * 2 articles = 4 articles

3. **Total Articles:**
   - Over the three days, Meredith wrote: 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles.

4. **Time Spent on Articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.
   - Total time = 11 articles * 4 hours/article.
   - Total time = 44 hours.
 


**The final answer is {44 hours} .**<end_of_turn><eos>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify known information:**
   * Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
   * She used 220 cups of coffee and placed a note on each.
   * She had 23 remaining after using them all.

2. **Determine the total Post-it notes used:**
   * Start with the initial number of notes: 80
   * Subtract the remaining notes: 80 - 23 = 57 notes were used.

3. **Calculate the number of packages:**
   * The number of notes used is equal to the total number of packages purchased.
 


**The final answer is**: 57 Post-it notes.

**Solution:**

1. **Define the units:**  
   *  We need to find out the number of pieces of wire.
   * We will use the consistent units throughout the problem (feet, inches).


2. **Convert everything to the same unit:**
    * 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.

3. **Set up the equation:**
    *  We know the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long.
    * So each piece of wire is equal to  48 inches / 6 inches= 8 pieces

4. **Final answer:** {The final answer is 8}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.
Since the wire was cut into pieces 6 inches long, Tracy obtained 48/6=<<48/6=8>>8 pieces

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Define the Problem**

* **Time:** We need to find the time it takes Tom to travel back from location 1 to location 4.
* **Speed:** We know Tom's speed is 10 mph during his outward journey.
* **Speed:** We know Tom's speed is 6 mph during his return journey.
* **Time of Journey:** We need to determine the duration of the whole trip including both the outward and return journey

**2. Break Down the Journey**

* **Outward:**  Tom travels from location 1 to location 4. 
* **Return:**  Tom travels from location 4 back to location 1.


**3. Determine the Time for Each Journey**

* **Outward Journey:**
    * **Time = Distance / Speed** 
    * **Distance:** We need to know how long Tom's outward journey is.
    * **Speed:** 10 mph
    * **Duration:** This needs to be figured out.
* **Return Journey:** 
    * **Time = Distance / Speed**
    * **Distance:** This needs to be figured out.
    * **Speed:** 6 mph
    * **Duration:** This needs to be figured out.

 
**4. Calculate Total Time**


* **Total Time = Time of Outward Journey + Time of Return Journey**

**1. Calculate revenue from truck tires on Thursday:**

* Cost per truck tire: $60
* Number of truck tires repaired: 6 
* Revenue from truck tires: $60 * 6 = $360

**2. Calculate revenue from car tires on Thursday:**

* Cost per car tire: $40
* Number of car tires repaired: 4
* Revenue from car tires: $40 * 4 = $160

**3. Calculate revenue from car tires on Friday:**

* Cost per car tire: $40
* Number of car tires repaired: 12
* Revenue from car tires: $40 * 12 = $480

**4. Calculate revenue earned on Thursday:**

* Total revenue from all tires: $360 + $160 = $520


**5. Calculate revenue earned on Friday:**

   - Trixie the second cat has had 12 kittens.

2. **Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has:**
   - Triple the number of adopted kittens: 7 kittens * 3 = 21 kittens

3. **Calculate the total number of kittens from both cats:**
  - Total kittens: 7 adopted kittens + 21 Patchy's kittens + 12 Trixie's kittens = 30 kittens

4. **The final answer is:** 30 kittens 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Define Unripe Oranges:**  We know 20% of the oranges are unripe. 
2. **Calculate Number of Unripe Oranges:** To find the number of unripe oranges, multiply the total number of oranges by the percentage: 
   * 25 oranges * 0.20 = 5 unripe oranges.
3. **Calculate Number of Sour Oranges:** We know 2 oranges are sour.
4. ** Calculate Total Bad or Sour Oranges:** Sum the numbers of unripe and sour oranges 
   * 5 unripe oranges + 2 sour oranges = 7 bad oranges.
5. **Difference Between Total and Bad:** This leaves us with the number of good oranges.
   * 25 oranges - 7 bad oranges = 18 good oranges.

**The final answer is:** 18 oranges are good.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* We need to figure out Aleena's total cost for the year.
* Her initial payment is $140 per month.
* The subscription gets reduced by 10% in the second half of the year.

**2. Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**

* We assume the subscription is billed over a 6-month period (This is standard for streaming services).
* The cost for the first half of the year (months 1-6) = $140/month * 6 months = $840.

**3. Calculate the cost for the second half of the year**

* The cost for the second half of the year (months 7-12) is 10% less than the first half.
* Cost for the second half = $140/month * 6 months - (10/100) * $140/month * 6 months 
* This simplifies to = $840 - (10/100) * $840. 

**4. Calculate the total cost**

* Add the cost for the first half and the second half.  


{The final answer is $840 - ($840 * 0.10) } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,
For the first six months, the streaming service charged her a total of 6*140 = $<<6*140=840>>840
For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.
The total amount of money she paid at the end of the year is $840+$756 = $<<840+756=1596>>1596

Here's the breakdown of how we can solve this step by step:

**1. Identify the Key Information**

* **Distance traveled:** 100 miles
* **Gas consumed:** 4 gallons 
* **Tank size:** 12 gallons
* **Gas Used Per Mile:** We need to find this.

**2. Calculate the Gas Used Per Gallon**

* Divide the total gallons of gas consumed by the number of miles traveled. 
* `Gas Used per mile = (4 gallons) / (100 miles)` 
* This will give us the gas needed per mile driven. 

**3. Find Total Distance per Tank**

* Multiply the gas tank size by the gas per mile we calculated in Step 2. 
* `Total Distance (per tank) = (12 gallons) * (Gas Used per mile)`

**4. Final Answer**

We can then add up all the different parts to find the total driving distance.

3. **Express the total savings equation:**
    * We know Bailey ends with $100, and she receives $40 in allowance.  Therefore, the equation stating her total savings x + $40 = $100
 
4. **Isolate the starting amount (x):**
  * Subtract $40 from both sides of the equation. 
  * x + $40 - $40 = $100 - $40
  * This simplifies to: x = $60

 	
**The final answer is $60**

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the unknown variables:** We need to find out the number of instructions in each recipe. Let's call these numbers *x* and *2x* respectively.

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**  We know that the second recipe has twice the number of instructions as the first.  This means:  
   *2x* = *2x*. 

3. **Solve for the unknown variable:**
   *  2x = 2x 
   To solve for *x*, the number of instructions in the first recipe, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2.
   * *x*  = *x*.

4. **Calculate the number of instructions in both recipes:**
   * The first recipe has *x* instructions.
   * The second recipe has *2x* instructions. 


5. **Find the total instructions required:** To prepare both dishes, Kelian will have to read a total of *x* + *2x* instructions.


**Final answer:** {The total number of instructions Kelian needs to read is 3x.}

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings from brownies.**

*  Tommy's earnings from brownies are calculated by multiplying the number of brownies sold by the price per slice.
*  Earnings from brownies = 43 brownies * $3/brownie = $129

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from cheesecakes.**

*  Tommy's earnings from cheesecakes are calculated by multiplying the number of cheesecakes sold by the price per slice.
*   Earnings from cheesecakes = 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.**

*   Total earnings = Earnings from brownies + Earnings from cheesecakes
*   Total earnings = $129 + $92 = $221

 
**Answer:** The final answer is { $221 } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.
Tommy raised 23 slices x $4 = $<<23*4=92>>92 by selling cheesecakes.
In total Tommy has raised $129 + $92 = $<<129+92=221>>221

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Identify the problem information:**
   * Cost of each phone: $150
   * Number of phones: 5
   * Interest rate: 2% per unit
   * Duration: 3 months

2. **Calculate the total cost of the phones:**
   * Total cost = Cost per phone * Number of phones 
   * Total cost = $150 * 5 = $750

3. **Determine the total interest to be charged:**
   * Total interest = Total cost * Interest rate 
   * Total interest = $750 * 0.02 = $15

4. **Calculate the total monthly payment:**
   * Total monthly payment = Total cost + total interest
   * Total monthly payment = $750 + $15 = $765



**The final answer is:** Shiela will pay $765 each month for 3 months. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.
So, each cell phone costs $150 + $3 = $<<150+3=153>>153.
The total amount to be paid for 5 cell phones is $153 x 5 = $<<153*5=765>>765.
Thus, Shiela will pay $765/3 = $<<765/3=255>>255 each month.

If . he makes a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has a square footage of 16, what is the average square , footage of ; a : level?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the problem and the logic we can use to approach it:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* We have a sandcastle structure with multiple levels.
* The area of each level decreases by half from the previous level.
*  We need to find the average square footage of each level in the 4-level structure.

**2.  Setting up the Relationships**

*  We know the top level (level 1) has 16 square feet.
* We need to find the square footage of the other levels.


**3.  Working Towards the Solution**

* **Level 2:**  Area = (1/2) * 16 square feet = 8 square feet
* **Level 3:**  Area = (1/2) * 8 square feet = 4 square feet
* **Level 4:**  Area = (1/2) * 4 square feet = 2 square feet 


**4. Calculating the Average** 

*  To find the average, sum up the areas of all the levels and divide by the number of levels.  

 {The average square footage of a level is 4 square feet.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32
Level 2 is 64 square feet because 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64
Level 1 is 128 square feet because 64 x 2 = <<64*2=128>>128
The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total cups of food needed in the first 180 days:**

* Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
* Total cups needed: 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups. 

**2. Calculate the number of days the puppy will be fed 2 cups per day:**

*  Cecilia's veterinarian instructs her to feed the puppy 2 cups a day after the first 180 days.
*  This is a continuous schedule, so we need to figure out how long this will go on.


 
This requires additional information, and we cannot provide a definitive answer. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups
The number of days left in the year is 365 - 180 = <<365-180=185>>185
The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

   * Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry: *Sarah's laundry = 400*
 


* **Step 3: Solve for David’s laundry**

  * We have the equation: *Sarah's laundry = 4 * x* 
  * Substitute Sarah's laundry value in the equation: *400 = 4 * x*
  * Solve for x: *x = 400 / 4 = 100* 

* **Step 4: Calculate Raymond’s laundry**

  *  *Raymond's laundry = (1/2) * Sarah's laundry*

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the price per flower for both package options:**
   -  Package of 3 flowers for $2.50.  This means each flower costs $2.50 / 3 = $0.83.
   - Package of 2 flowers for $1.00. This means each flower costs $1.00 / 2 = $0.50.

2. **Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers using the better price:**
   - The price per flower is $0.50.
   - So 18 flowers would cost 18 * $0.50 = $9.00.


3. **Compare the cost of buying 18 flowers with the costs of buying them with the other option:**
   - The cost of 18 flowers at the other price is $0.83 per flower * 18 flowers = $15.00

1.  The water per each girl
2.  The total water each girl got
3.  The total water received by the two girls
4.  The water left after the two girls
5.  The final answer


Let's break down the calculation:

**1. Water per each girl:** 
   * Each girl got 1/6 of 24 liters. 
   *  This is equal to (1/6) * 24 liters = 4 liters.

**2. Total water each girl got:**
   * They each got 4 liters.
   * Therefore, the two girls combined received 4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

**3. Total water received by the two girls:**
  * They received 8 liters.

**4. Water left after the two girls:**
  * The total water was 24 liters, but they got 8 liters.
  * Water left is 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters.

 **5. Final Answer:** {The final answer is 16 liters} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.
So the two girls got a total of 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 liters.

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

*  Let 'G' represent Grace's weight.
*  Let 'A' represent Alex's weight.

**2. Set up equations based on given information:**

*  We know Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight.  
   This can be expressed as:  A = 4G - 2 
*  We know Grace weighs 125 pounds. 
    We can write this as: G = 125
 

**3.  Solve for Alex's weight:**

* Substitute the value of G from step 2 into the equation for A: 
   A = 4(125) - 2 
*  Calculate: 
    A = 500 - 2 
    A = 498

**4.  Calculate the combined weight:**

*  Add Grace's weight and Alex's weight:
    A + G = 498 + 125
    A + G = 623

 
  **The final answer is:** 623 pounds.

                    Dan . plants 3 ; rose bushes. Each rose ? bush has 25 roses. Each ; rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns are ; there total?<end_of_turn>
*Step 1*: Define variables.
 *Step 2*: Set up an equation.
 *Step 3*: Solve the equation.
 *Step 4*: State the answer.


Let's solve this.

*Step 1*: Define variables.
   * Let 'r' represent the number of rose bushes. 
   * Let 't' represent the total number of thorns.


*Step 2*:  Set up an equation.
  * We know:
    * r = 3 rose bushes
    * Each bush has 25 roses:  25r     
    * Each rose has 8 thorns: 25r * 8  

*Step 3*: Solve the equation.
    *  We need to find the total number of thorns so:
    * t = 25r * 8 
    * t = 200r
    * We know r   = 3
    
*Step 4*: State the answer.
   *  t = 200 * 3
   * t = 600
 


{The final answer is 600 thorns.}<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total number of roses: 3 bushes * 25 roses/bush = <<3*25=75>>75 roses
Then multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: 75 roses * 8 thorns/rose = <<75*8=600>>600 thorns

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    A football ; team played 22 games. They . won 8 more than they lost. How many did they win?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understand the problem.** 
*  We know the team played 22 games.
*  They won 8 more than they lost. 

**Step 2: Define variables.**
* Let 'l' represent the number of games they lost.
* Then, 'w' represents the number of games they won.

**Step 3: Set up an equation.**
* We know that 'w' = 'l' + 8. 
* The sum of the wins and losses equals the total number of games: w + l = 22

**Step 4: Solve for 'l'.**

* We can quickly solve the equation for 'w' using the given information.
* Since we know w = l + 8, substitute that in from Step 3

 * (l + 8) + l = 22

**Step 5: Solve for 'l'.**
* Combine like terms: 2l + 8 = 22
* Subtract 8 from both sides: 2l = 14
* Divide both sides by 2: l = 7

**Step 6: Find 'w'.** 
*  w = l + 8
* Substitute l = 7: w = 7 + 8
*  w = 15


**The final answer is: They won 15 games.**  
 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

How many quilt blocks , does he have in ? total?<end_of_turn>
*

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1.  Understand the Problem:**

* Gene is making quilts from old t-shirts. 
* Each t-shirt becomes a block in the quilt.
* He has different quilt blocks representing each year of his vacations.
* He goes on four vacations a year.
* He has been vacationing for 11 years (34 - 23 = 11).

**2. Identify Key Information:**

* Number of vacations: 4 per year
* Total years of vacationing: 11
* Each t-shirt becomes a block 
 

**3. Formulate a Plan to Find the Total Number of Quilt Blocks**

To find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to consider:

* **Number of shirts:**  He has one shirt from each vacation. 
* **Number of quilts:** Each shirt contributes one block to a quilt.



**4. Calculate the Total Number of Quilt Blocks:**

* **Total quilts:** 11 years of vacationing.  
* **Blocks per year:** 1 shirt per vacation * 1 block per shirt = 1 block per shirt


**5. Final Calculation and Answer** 

{The final answer is 11}  



Let me know if you need any more clarification. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Understand the Pattern**

* We need to figure out how many times the alarm rings in total.
* We are given the number of rings for each initial timing.

**Step 2: Define the Times**

* The alarm rings for the first time - 4 times.
* The alarm rings for the second time - 3 times.
* The alarm rings for the third time - half as time as the second time. This means it rings for 3/2 times as long.

 
**Step 3: Calculate the Third Ring Duration**

* The third time the alarm rings for half as long as the second time, meaning it rings for 3/2 times as long.


**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Rings**
 
 


**Step 5: Final Answer**


The final answer is: 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.

* **Step 1**: Determine the initial salary
* **Step 2**: Calculate the increase after five years
* **Step 3**: Calculate the salary after three years
* **Step 4**: State the final answer


Here is the solution:

* **Step 1**: Determine the initial salary.
   - The initial salary is $600 per month * 12 months = $7,200 per year.

* **Step 2**: Calculate the increase after five years.
   - The increase after five years is 10% of $7,200 = $720.

* **Step 3**: Calculate the salary after three years.
   - The salary after three years is $7,200 (initial salary) + $720 (increase) = $7,920.




* **Step 4**: State the final answer.
 {The final answer is $7,920} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let `x` represent the number of copies Harald sold.

**2. Set up an Equation:**

* Marilyn's sales are 10 times Harald's, so Marilyn's sales are `10x` copies. 
* The total sales are 88,000 copies:  `x + 10x = 88,000`

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms:  `11x = 88,000`
* Divide both sides by 11:  `x = 8000`

**4. The Answer:**

* Harald sold **8,000** copies.  {The final answer is 8,000}


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get 10h + h = 88,000
Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000

If there will be 20 adults and 5 ? children at ! the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad : does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he . hopes to ; have , enough to feed everyone?<end_of_turn>


**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the potato salad children need:**
   - A child eats half as much as an adult, so they need 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs of potato salad.

2. **Calculate the total potato salad needed for the adults:**
   - Ted needs 10 lbs per adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs of potato salad for the adults.
  
3. **Calculate the total potato salad needed for the children:**
   - Ted needs 5 lbs per child * 5 children = 25 lbs of potato salad for the children.

4. **Calculate the total potato salad needed:**
  - Ted needs 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs of potato salad for all the dinosaurs.


**The final answer is** 225 lbs. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.
To feed 20 dinosaur adults, he will need 20*10=<<20*10=200>>200 pounds of potato salad.
To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1.  Define variables:**

*  Let  'x' represent Jackson's age.
*  Amy's age = x + 5  
*  Corey's age = x + 2
*  James's age = x + 1

**2. Set up equations based on given information:**

**3. Solve for x:**

*  Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
    * x = 9 


**4.  Find Amy's Age:**

*  Amy's age = x + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14

**5.  Find Corey's Age:**
*  Corey's age = x + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11

*Please provide a clear and detailed step-by-step explanation.


**Here's how to solve the problem:**

**1. Understand the Problem:**

*  Lee's time: 38 seconds for the 400-meter hurdles.
*  Gerald's time: Unknown, but he is 2 seconds slower than Lee.
*  Gerald's diet improvement: 10% speed increase.


**2. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent Gerald's original time. 

**3. Formulate an Equation:**

*  Lee's time = original Gerald's time + 2 
*  This means: 38 = x + 2
    
**4. Solve for x (Gerald's original time):** 
*  Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation. 
*  38 - 2 = x 
*  36 = x

**5. Calculate Gerald's Speed with Improved Diet:**

*  Gerald's time is (36) seconds, and his speed increased by 10%. 
*  So, we calculate 36 * 1.10 = 39.6 seconds.



**6. Find The Final Answer:**

*Please, be specific and complete!*



**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    - Harry slept 9 hours.
    - James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept.

2. **Determine a variable to represent the unknown:**
   Let 'x' represent the number of hours James slept. 

3. **Translate the second statement into an equation:**
   * We know that James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept:  x = (2/3) * 9 

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   * x = 6

5. **Calculate the difference between Harry's and James's sleep:**
    * Harry's sleep - James's sleep = 9 - 6

6. **Answer the question:**
   * The final answer is: 3 hours 


<end_of_turn><eos>","James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.
So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.

{The final answer is}


Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Problem:** Freda's tomatoes lose half their volume when she converts them to sauce.  We need to find out how many tomatoes were originally in the can.  We also need to figure out how many cans we have used. 

2. **Identify Formulas:** We can use the information about the sauce to find the number of tomatoes, but we need to know the relationship between the cans and the volume of sauce created.


3. **Apply the Information:**
   * **Sauce Volume:** We know Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces. 
   * **Volume Reduction:** Each can of tomatoes loses half its volume, meaning the cans result in 32/2=16 ounces of sauce
   
4. **Calculate the Tomatoes:**
   * **Total Can Volume:** 16 ounces
   * **Number of Tomatoes per Can:** 3 tomatoes

5. {The final answer is}



Let me know if you'd like to try another problem! <end_of_turn><eos>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

{The final answer is}   


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Understand the problem:**

* We have a traffic jam on a motorway
* Some cars enter and exit the traffic jam
* We need to determine the number of cars that drive through the jam in the first 15 minutes.

**2. Analyze the information:**

* The problem is framed in this way: 
    * Cars arrive at the motorway. 
    * Cars drive through the jam. 

 **3. Identify Key Variables:**

* Original Number of cars: 30
* Time of the jam: Two 15-minute periods 
* Number of cars exiting the line: 5 

**4. Formulate the Calculation:**

*  To find the number of cars passing through the jam during the first 15 minutes, we need to be aware of the cars *entering* and *exiting* during this timeframe. 



Let me know if you'd like any further breakdown of a specific step. 

<end_of_turn><eos>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

Feeling generous, she has decided that she , will give 1 potted plant from ; each ledge to friends and family tomorrow. How many potted plants will Mary remain . with?<end_of_turn>
  


Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of plants Mary starts with:**
   * Mary has 2 plants/ledge * 40 ledges = 80 plants.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants she'll give away:**
   * She's giving away 1 plant/ledge * 40 ledges = 40 plants.

3. **Calculate the total number of plants Mary will have remaining:**
   * Mary's total plants - plants she's giving away = remaining plants
   * 80 plants - 40 plants = 40 plants


{The final answer is 40 plants.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants
After receiving an additional 18 plants, she therefore had a total of 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants
Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.

*Provide each step and give a detailed explanation

**Solution**

1. **Define Variables:** Let's use the following variables to represent the number of doorbell rings:
    *  *x* : the number of doorbell rings for the first friend. 

2. **Set Up Equation:** Now, we need to find out how many doorbell rings the second and third friends made. 
    *  The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we can express the number of doorbell rings for the second friend as *x + (1/4)x* .
    * The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
    * The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.


3. **Work Through:**
    *  We then need to continue to set up an equation for the third friend's doorbell rings.  
    
{The final answer is} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, a total of 1/4*20=<<1/4*20=5>>5 times.
Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 20+5=<<20+5=25>>25
The first two friends pressed on the doorbell 25+20=<<25+20=45>>45 times altogether before Jerome could open the door.
Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 60+10=<<60+10=70>>70 times before Jerome could open the door.
Altogether, Jerome's third and fourth friends pressed on the doorbell 70+60=<<70+60=130>>130 times before Jerome could open.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the number of water drinks per weekday:**  
    - John drinks a glass of water at breakfast.
    - He drinks a glass of water at lunch.
    - He drinks a glass of water at dinner. 
    - He drinks a glass of water before bed.

2. **Calculate the total number of water drinks per weekday:**

**Here's how we can solve the problem:**

1. **Determine the fog bank's speed:**
    * The fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.
    * This means its speed is 3 miles / 10 minutes = 0.3 miles per minute.

2. **Calculate the time to cover the entire city:**
    * The entire city is 42 miles in length.
    *  To find the total time, we multiply the speed by the distance.
    *  Time = Speed × Distance 
    *  Time = 0.3 miles per minute × 42 miles 
    *  Time = 12.6 minutes.

 **The Final Answer is:** 12.6 minutes.

Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**1. Define the dimensions:**

*  Box 1: 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches
*  Box 2: 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches
*  Box 3: 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches

**2. Calculate the volume of each box:**

*  Volume = Length x Width x Height
*  Box 1: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
*  Box 2: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches
*  Box 3: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches

**3. The additional information about the walls**

We want to find the total inner volume.  Adding the thickness of the walls to the dimensions. 


**4. Adjust for the wall thickness:**
 
*  The walls are 1 inch thick.

**5. Final Calculation:**
*  Add the volume of the boxes to find the total volume.




**Final Answer: { 3 * 120 cubic inches = 360 cubic inches}**<end_of_turn><eos>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

   - Frankie watched 1 hour/night * 2 nights = 2 hours.

2. **Total TV Time from Wednesday:**
   - He watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, and we need to figure out how many

3. **Total TV time from Thursday:**
   - He watched 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours. 

4. **Total TV time from Friday:**
   - He watched 2 hours. 

5. **Total hours watched all week:**
   - 2 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.   

6. **Episodes watched on Wednesday:**
   - We know Frankie watched 7 hours total and need to figure out how many 30-minute episodes.

*This is a word problem, so you will need to work through it step by step.*



**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

1. **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
    * Henry made twice as many cookies this year as last year, so:  x * 2 = number of cookies he baked this year 
    * He baked 15 more cookies this year than last year, so:  x * 2 + 15 = number of cookies he baked this year
    * He dropped 5 cookies, so:  Number of cookies remaining = number of cookies baked - dropped cookies
3. **Solve for 'x':** 
   * Henry baked 110 cookies
   * Number of cookies baked = number of cookies remaining + dropped cookies
4. **Substitute and solve for x:**


 
{The final answer is 50} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of gas without cashback.**

* The cost of 1 gallon of gas is $3.00.

**2. Calculate the cashback amount.**

* The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon.
* The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon.


**3. Calculate the total cost of the gas with cashback**

* Multiply the cost per gallon by the number of gallons bought.
* $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

**4. Subtract the cashback amount from the total cost.**
 
* $30.00 - $0.20 = $29.80



{The final answer is $29.80} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00
The app is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon and they buy 10 gallons so that's .20*10 = $<<0.20*10=2.00>>2.00

It : took her : sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The ! shore ? was ? 64 . seconds , away. How ! much water ? had : the boat taken on ; by the : time Julia reached shore?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Establish the rate of water intake:**

*   **Rowing speed:** Julia rows back 20 feet in 16 seconds. 
*   **Speed per foot:**  To find the speed per foot, divide the rowing distance (20 feet) by the time (16 seconds): 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.

**2. Determine water intake per feet:**
*   **Water intake rate:**  The water intake rate is two liters for every ten feet.  This means Julia adds 2 liters/10 feet.

**3.  Calculate the total water uptake:** 
*   **Distance covered:** The distance to the shore was 64 seconds. 

**4.  Apply the water intake rate to the distance covered:**

*   Let's consider the time spent rowing based on the distance covered: Julia takes 64 seconds to reach the shore. 
 


 {The final answer is 1.28 liters } 

<end_of_turn><eos>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and ? uses the whiteboard in each lesson. If : the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, how many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the information:**
   -  Number of teachers: 4
   -  Lessons per day per teacher: 2
   -  Cleaning per lesson: 3 times

2. **Determine the total cleaning needs:**
   -  Calculate total lessons per day: 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons

3. **Calculate the total whiteboard cleaning per day:**
   -  Multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings

 {The final answer is 24}

Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'b' represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
* Let 'j' represent the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.

**2. Set up Equations Based on Given Information**

*  ""Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone."" 
    *  j = 6b
* ""The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.""
    * 50 * (number of birds in Jamal's picture) = b 

    
**3.  Solve for the Number of Birds**

* We can use the second equation to solve for the number of birds.

**4. Substitute and Solve for Ducks**

* Substitute the value of 'b' from step 3 into the first equation  (j = 6b).
* We now know the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold.  We then can determine how many ducks are in Jamal's picture.



Let me know if you need more guidance on any stage of this. <end_of_turn><eos>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

Here's how to break down Sasha's profit calculation:

**1. Calculate the cost of the 2x4x10 boards:**

* Cost per board: $10
* Number of boards: 10
* Total cost: $10/board * 10 boards = $100

**2. Calculate the cost of the 4x4x10 boards:**

* Cost per board: $16

**Here's a step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let  'x' be the salary Adrien earned four years ago.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**

* **Equation 1 (Current salary):** Adrien's current salary =  x + 0.30x = 1.30x 
* **Equation 2 (Salary increase):** Adrien's salary four years later = (x + 0.30x) + 0.40(x + 0.30x) = 1.10x + 0.12x = 1.22x 


**Step 3:  Find the Current Salary**

* We are given that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago. 
* We can now use the equation of his current salary to find his current salary

**Step 4:  Calculate the Total Salary**


*  To find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later, we use our previous equations.





Let me know if you would like further clarification on any of these steps.

In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

    * Her total sleep for the next two days is 6 + 6 = 12 hours.

2. **Calculate the sleep Sadie had for the rest of the week:** 
    * Sadie slept 1 hour more than her days before that so she slept was 12 + 1= 13 hours.

3. **Calculate the total sleep for the whole week:**

**Solution:**

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the distance run in the first session:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 10 miles/hour  x 3 hours
* Distance = 30 miles

**2. Calculate the distance run in the second session:**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 5 miles/hour  x 7 hours
* Distance = 35 miles

**3. Calculate the total distance:**

* Total distance = Distance in the first session + Distance in the second session
* Total distance = 30 miles + 35 miles 
* Total distance = 65 miles


**The final answer is 65 miles. **

*

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Set up the variables**

*  Let  'x' represent the number of spoons in the original purchase.

**2. Create equations based on the information given**

*  ""She was out of plastic spoons, so she bought a new package"" tells us that she started with less than the final amount.  We can express this as:  x + 5 = 12 
* ""She was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample the stew""

**3. Solve for 'x'**

* From the previous step, x + 5 = 12
* Subtract 5 from both sides: x = 7.



 **The final answer is:7** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.
Since the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.

* **Knowns:**
    * Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 
    * Dylan bought more fish sausages than chicken sausages by 6.
* **Unknowns:**
    * Number of fish sausages 
    * Total number of sausages

**2. Formulate an Equation Based on the Given Information:**

* Let 'f' represent the number of fish sausages. 
*  Chicken sausages + fish sausages = Total sausages
*  38 + f = Total sausages

**3. Use the Information about the Additional Fish Sausages:**

* Since Dylan has more fish sausages than chicken sausages by 6, the equation becomes:
*  38 + f = Total sausages
*  38 + f = 38 + 6


**4. Solve for the Number of Fish Sausages:**

* To find the number of fish sausages, we subtract the number of chicken sausages.

   

**5. Find the Total Number of Sausages:**

{The final answer is}


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the problem:**
   *  We are given that Amy has 20 more friends than Lily.
   *  Lily made 50 friends.
   *  Our goal is to find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have.   

**2.  Determine Amy's friends:**
   *  Amy made 20 more friends than Lily,  so we need to find that extra number. 
   * Lily made 50 friends.
   * Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20


**3.  Write an equation for the number of friends:**
   *  Let's use variables:
      *  Let 'L' be the number of friends Lily has. 
      *  Let 'A' be the number of friends Amy has.
   *  We can set up an equation: A = L + 20


**4.  Find the total number of friends:**
   * Combine the equation for Amy's friends (A) and Lily's friends (L):
   *  A + L = total friends 
   *  Substitute our known values: (L+20) + L = total friends, or 2L + 20 = total friends 

**5. Solve for the total number of friends:**
* We know Lily made 50 friends 
* Substitute the value of L into the equation: 2L + 20 = total friends



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Lily made 50 friends, Amy made 50+20 =<<50+20=70>>70 friends.
Together, they made 70+50 = <<70+50=120>>120 friends at the new school.

**Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    * Watermelons: cost 3 times the price of peppers. 
    * Oranges: cost 5 less than a watermelon.
    * Dillon's purchases: 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, 10 oranges.
    * Price of a pepper: $15.

2. **Break down the price of a watermelon:**
    *  Let's call the price of a pepper ""p"".
    *  Watermelon cost = 3p

3. **Determine the price of an orange:**
    * Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
    * Orange cost = 3p - $5

4. **Calculate the total cost of the watermelons:**
   * Total cost of watermelons = 4 * watermelon cost 
   * Total cost of watermelons = 4 * (3p) = 12p

5. **Calculate the total cost of the peppers:**
   * Total cost of peppers = 20 * pepper cost 
   * Total cost of peppers = 20 * $15 = $300

6. **Calculate the total cost of the oranges:**
   * Total cost of oranges = 10 * orange cost  
   * Total cost of oranges = 10 * (3p - $5) 
   * Total cost of oranges = 30p - $50

7. **Calculate the total cost:**
   * Total cost = Total cost of watermelons + Total cost of peppers + Total cost of oranges 
   * Total cost = 12p + $300 + 30p - $50

   
8. **Simplify the equation:**
   * Total cost = 42p + $250



{The final answer is 42p + $250} 

 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1.  Calculate total appointment time per day:**

*  Patients seen per day: 500
*  Average appointment duration: 24 minutes 
*  Total appointment time in minutes: 500 * 24 = 12000 minutes

**2. Calculate time cost for doctors:**

*  Doctors charge: $150/hour
*  Total doctor hours: 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours

**3. Calculate cost of patient visits:**

*  Patients see the doctors for: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000


**4. Calculate revenue from patient care:**

*  The hospital charges: $200/hour
*  Total hour: 200 hours
*  Total revenue: $200/hour * 200 hours = $40,000


**5. Determine profit:** 

*  Profit = Revenue - Cost
*  Profit = $40,000 - $30,000 = $10,000


**The final answer is:** $10,000 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Start with the initial number of elves:** Nissa! hires 60 seasonal elves.

2. **Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them:** A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them, so 60 / 3 = 20 elves quit.

3. **Calculate the number of elves remaining after the first round of quits:**  There were 60 elves initially, and 20 quit, so there are 60 - 20 = 40 elves left.

4. **Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins:** 10 elves quit after kids kick their shins. 

5. **Calculate the final number of elves:** Start with 40 and subtract the number who quit after kids kick their shins: 40 - 10 = 30 elves.



{The final answer is 30} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the June expenditure.**

* We're given that Joseph's June expenditure was $60 less than May's.
*  Therefore, June's expenditure = May's expenditure - $60
* June's expenditure = $500 - $60 = $440

**Step 2: Calculate the total expenditure.**

* Total expenditure = May's expenditure + June's expenditure
* Total expenditure = $500 + $440 = $940 {The final answer is $940}

Let's work this out!

**Answer:** {The final answer is 120 tickets}



Let's walk through the steps:

* **Step 1: Determine the total number of tickets Pam used for roller coaster rides.**
    * Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
    * Each ride cost 6 tickets.
    * Total tickets used for roller coasters: 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.

* **Step 2: Determine the total number of tickets Fred used for roller coaster rides.**
    * Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
    * Each ride cost 6 tickets.
    * Total tickets used for roller coasters: 4 * 6 = 24 tickets.

* **Step 3: Determine the total number of tickets each used on the luge.** 
    * Each used the luge 2 times. 
    * Each luge ride costs 6 tickets. 
    * Total tickets used on the luge: 2 * 6 = 12 tickets.

* **Step 4: Add the total tickets used from each ride.**
    * Total tickets used: 12 + 24 + 12  = 48 tickets. 


{The final answer is 48 tickets} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.
The total times they ride that day is 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 times.
So, Pam and Fred used 10x6=<<10*6=60>>60 tickets that day.

Here's the breakdown.

**Step 1: Set up the variables.**

Let's represent:

*  'b' as the number of blue gumballs. 
*  'p' as the number of pink gumballs.

**Step 2: Write the given information as equations.**

 The problem states:

* ""There are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.""  This translates to the equation:  p = 4b + 22
* ""If there are 12 bluegumballs"" This translates to the equation: b = 12

**Step 3: Solve for 'p' using the given information.**

Substitute the value of 'b' we found in step 2 into the equation p = 4b + 22:
* p = 4(12) + 22 
* p = 48 + 22
* p = 70

**Step 1: Find the number of semi-automatic cars.**

* Start with the total number of cars: 20
* Subtract the number of automatic cars: 20 - 12 = 8 cars
* These 8 cars are the semi-automatic cars. 

**Step 2: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.**

* Divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars.
*  8 / 20 = 0.4
* Convert the decimal to a percentage: 0.4 * 100% = 40%


 **The final answer is:** 40% of the cars are semi-automatic. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.
Therefore, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 4/20 x 100% = 20%.

**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define Variables:**
   * Let `q` represent the number of queens.
   * Let `b` represent the number of baby bees.
   * Let `w` represent the number of worker bees.

**2. Set up Equations:**

   * We're given that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. That means: `w = 2b` 
   * We're given that there are twice as many baby bees as queens.  We are told  this in the sentence ""There are twice as many babies as queens."" That means: `b = 2q`

**3. Solve for Worker Bees:**

   * We can use the equation `w = 2b` which means:
   * Substitute the value of b from the previous steps: `w = 2 * (2q)`
   * Simplify: `w = 4q`

**4. Substitute to Find the Number of Workers**

* We know that `w` can only be solved in terms of `q`
* Use the equation `w = 4q` and substitute `q` with its values in terms of `b` or `w` 

{The final answer is}

   - Jordan earns $10 per hour.
   - He spends 2 hours playing games.
   - His daily earnings from work would be 2 hours * $10/hour = $20.

**2. Calculate the weekly earnings from work:** 
   - He earns $20 per day.

**2. Calculate the Total Cost of the Food Items:**

* $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

**3. Calculate the Value of Non-Food Items:**

*  Total cost of food items: $15
*  Cost of Tax: 10% of $15.
*  Tax rate calculation: 10/100 * $15 = $1.50

**4. Calculate the Total Cost, including tax:**

* Total cost of items: 15

Profit is the difference between : total income , and total expenses, so how much profit, ! in dollars, will Lucas ? make ; each week?<end_of_turn>
 
Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:** 
   - Kim starts with 3 clients.
   - He gets 5 new clients.
   - Total clients: 3 + 5 = 8 clients

2. **Determine the number of bottles and cloths needed per week:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Total bleach bottles needed: 8 clients * 2 bottles/client = 16 bottles
   - Total cloths needed: 8 clients * 1 cloth/client = 8 cloths

3. **Calculate the total cost of bleach:**
   - Each bottle costs $2.
   - Total cost of bleach: 16 bottles * $2/bottle = $32

4. **Calculate the total cost of cloths:**
   - Each pack costs $5.
   - Total cost of cloths: 8 packs * $5/pack = $40

5. **Calculate Kim’s total weekly income: **
   - $92

6. **Calculate Kim’s total weekly expenses:**
   - $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloths) = $72

7. **Calculate Kim’s weekly profit:**
   - Profit = Income - Expenses
   - Profit = $92 - $72 = $20


{The final answer is $20} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**Step 1:  Calculate the total number of pineapples**
* John has 10 hectares of pineapple field.
* There are 100 pineapples per hectare. 
* Total pineapples: 10 hectares * 100 pineapples/hectare = 1000 pineapples

**Step 2:  Determine the number of harvesting periods in a year**
* John harvests his pineapples every 3 months.
* There are 12 months in a year. 
* Harvesting periods in a year: 12 months / 3 months/harvest = 4 harvesting periods

**Step 3: Calculate the total pineapples harvested in a year**
* Each harvest period yields the same number of pineapples.
* Total pineapples harvested in a year: 4 harvesting periods * 1000 pineapples/harvesting period = 4000 pineapples{The final answer is} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Information**

* **Lego Set 1:** 500 pieces
* **Lego Set 2:** 3 times the pieces of Set 1 (3 * 500 = 1500 pieces)
* **Lego Set 3:** 1/4 the number of pieces of Set 1 (1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces)

**2. Calculate the Number of Blocks for Set 2**

* We already know Set 2 has 1500 pieces.

**3. Calculate the Number of Blocks for Set 3**

* We already know Set 3 has 125 pieces. 

**4. Calculate the Total Number of Blocks**

*  Add the number of blocks from all sets together.


{The final answer is 1825}


<end_of_turn><eos>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks

Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

**1. Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**

* Debra observes 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours.

**2. Bees returning to the hive in the next 6 hours:**

* Debra sees 1/2 the number of bees leave, which is  30 / 2 = 15 bees returning.

**3. Total bees leaving and returning in the first 12 hours:**

*  Debra sees a total of 30 + 15 = 45 bees leave and return in the first 12 hours.

**4. Bees leaving and returning in the next 6 hours:**

* Debra sees 2 times as many bees leaving as entering so far, which is 45*2 = 90 bees
 

**5. Final answer:**


{The final answer is 45 bees. }



<end_of_turn><eos>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the knowns:**
    - Admission for an adult ticket is $12.
    - Admission for a child ticket is $10.
    - Brittany's mom gave the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket.
    - Brittany's mom received $8 in change.

2. **Set up an equation based on the knowns:**
    - Let 'x' represent the total amount paid by her mom.
    - The equation is: x = cost of child + cost of adult 
    - The cost of a child ticket: $10
    - The cost of an adult ticket: $12
    - Thus, x = $10 + $12

3. **Solve for the total paid:**
    - x = $22

4 **Find the amount paid by mom with the change equation:**
   - She received $8 in change.
   - This means the total amount paid was $22 + $8
   -  $22 + $8 = $30

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the key information**:
   - Steve's speed: 440 feet/minute  
   - Steve's distance from school: 3 miles
   - Tim's speed: 264 feet/minute
   - Tim's distance from school: 2 miles

2. **Calculate Steve's travel time**:
   - Convert miles to feet: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
   - Time = Distance / Speed  
   - Time = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

3. **Calculate Tim's travel time**:
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time = 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes. 

4. **Determine the winner**:
   - Steve will finish the race in 36 minutes.

                    Shawnda decides : that her neighborhood . kids ! could really use a bike . inflation : service. She . decides the ; best way to charge : is : by . the tire. Each tire : costs 25 cents , to inflate. On : the : first ; day, 5 people on . bicycles came by to ! get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle ! tires inflated. Finally, , one : person actually . came by on a . unicycle. ? How many ; dollars did she make , that ? day?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Tires Inflated:**

* People on bicycles: 5 
* People with tricycles: 3
* People with unicycles: 1
* Total tires inflated: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 tires

**2. Calculate Total Earnings:**

* Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate
* Total earnings: 9 tires * 25 cents/tire = $2.25

{The final answer is $2.25}<end_of_turn><eos>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.
There was one unicycle tire to fill up because 1 times 1 equals 1.
There were 20 total tires to fill up because 10 plus 9 plus 1 equals <<10+9+1=20>>20.
She made $5 because 20 times .25 equals <<20*.25=5>>5.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the total number of cookies:**

* Carl has 10 packs of cookies.
* Each pack has 6 cookies.
* Total cookies: 10 packs * 6 cookies/pack = 60 cookies

**2. Calculate the total cost of the cookies:**

* Each cookie costs $0.10.
* Total cost: 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00

**3. Determine the change Carl receives:**

* Carl pays with a $10 bill.
* Change =  $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00


{The final answer is $4.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.
Thus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.
Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.

*Given:* information about how many fries were eaten and moved along by a variety of creatures. 

*Request:* To determine the original number of fries.



**Solution:**

1. **Start with the given information:**
   * Dave ate 14 fries.
   * Half of the fries the seagull ate were from Dave's original pack. That means half the fries the seagull ate were from Dave's pack.
   * Three pigeons ate three fries each, 3 pigeons * 3 french fries/pigeon = 9 fries.
   * Two-thirds of the remaining fries were taken by the raccoon.
   * Five fries were left behind.

2. **Set up equations:** This will be a bit tedious, and so we will have to break it down into parts. 
   * Let's say initially there were ""x"" fries in the pack.
   * The seagull ate half of Dave’s fries, so 14 / 2 = 7 fries were gone.
   * The three pigeons ate 9 fries, that means 7 + 9 = 16 fries.
   * The raccoon ate two-thirds of what was left so we can set up an equation 16(2/3) = 32 fries.

3. **Final answer :** 



Let me know if you'd like me to break down any specific step further or want to work on another problem! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

In one , semester, there are ; 16 : weeks of school.  In one semester, how many hours does ! Kimo . spend attending classes?<end_of_turn>
 
Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate total class time for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**

*  Kimo has 3 classes of 1 hour each on these days, so the total class time is 3 * 1 hour = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate total class time for Tuesdays and Thursdays**

* He has 2 classes of 2 hours each on these days, so the total class time is 2 * 2 hour = 4 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate total class time per week**

* On his busy days (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) he spends 3 hours a day * 16 weeks = 48 hours per semester

**Step 4: Calculate total class time per week on Tuesdays and Thursdays**

* He spends 4 hours a day * 16 weeks = 64 hours per semester

**Step 5: Calculate the total weekly class time**

* The total weekly class time is 48 hours + 64 hours = 112 hours. 



{The final answer is 112 hours}<end_of_turn><eos>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.

* We need to find the total distance Blake runs and calculate Kelly's total distance.
* Then, identify the difference in the total distance between Blake and Kelly.

**2. Blake's Distance Calculation**

* Blake runs back and forth 15 times. 
*  Each run/back is equal to a 100-yard distance
* This means Blake covers 15 * 100 yards, which equals 1500 yards

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understand the Problem**

* We're dealing with a tank's water depth over time. 
* We know the initial depth (Monday) and the changes in depth over subsequent days.
* We need to find the water depth on Wednesday.


**2.  Set up the Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the initial depth on Monday.
* On Tuesday, the depth is ""x + 7"" feet.
* On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of Tuesday's depth, meaning (2/3)(x + 7) 

**3.  Relate the Changes**

* The depth on Wednesday is directly related to the initial depth on Monday and the change in depth over Tuesday. We can express this mathematically as: (2/3)(x + 7)

**4.  Solve for the Initial Depth on Monday** 

* This equation allows us to calculate the water depth on Wednesday.

*Please answer the question.*

## Step-by Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:** 
    - Anakin caught: 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
    - Locsin caught: 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. 

2. **Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught:**
    - Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

3. **Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught:**
    - Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

4. **Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught:**
    - Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

5. **Calculate the total fish caught by Anakin:** 
    - Anakin caught 10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish

6. **Calculate the total fish caught by Locsin:** 
   - Locsin caught 5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

7. **Combine Anakin’s and Locsin’s total fish:**
   -  19 fish + 13 fish = 32 fish


**The final answer is 32 fish** . 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.
Locsin caught 6 - 3 = <<6-3=3>>3 seahorses
They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the price increase for each two-month period.**

* The price increases by 20% of the original price. 
* This means each two-month period, the price increases by 0.20 * $20 = $4.

**2. Calculate the price after each two-month period.**

* Original Price + Price Increase = Price after the increase.
* $20 + $4 = $24

**3. Calculate the cost after 36 months.**

* Since the price increases every two months, we'll calculate the costs after 36 periods (2 month periods)
*  We'll do the calculation for each two months of increases

 

{The final answer is $1,680}
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72
After the total increase of the price of the bag of marbles after 36 months, the total cost will be $20+$72 = $<<20+72=92>>92

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine the value of a single red car.**

* We know one red car costs $4.

**2.  Determine the value of three action figures.**

* The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we know one action figure costs $5.
* Therefore, 3 action figures cost 3 * $5 = $15.

**3. Calculate the value of all the toys.**

* We know the doll costs $15, 5 red cars cost $4 * 5 = $20, and action figures cost $15.
* The total value of all toys is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

How much more money will she have if she hires the accountant?<end_of_turn>
        
Here's how we can step-by-step analyze the problem:

**1. Calculate Jackie's potential loss in freelance income:**

* Jackie will lose 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
* Each hour of freelance work: $35/hour
* Loss in freelance income: 3 hours * $35/hour = $105

**2. Calculate the cost of doing the taxes herself:**

* Jackie will spend $105 on freelance work she will lose. 


**3. Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:**

* The accountant charges $90.

**4. Find the difference between the cost of doing taxes herself and the cost of hiring an accountant:** 

*  $90 (cost of accountant) - $105 (cost of doing taxes herself) = -$15

 
{The final answer is -$15}


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105
Then subtract the accountant's charge to find how much money Janet saves: $105 - $90 = $<<105-90=15>>15

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate eggs needed for all the flans:**

* Sandra needs 3 eggs per flan.
* She needs to make 15 flans.
* Total eggs needed: 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs

**2. Calculate how many baskets of eggs are needed:**

* Each basket gives her 9 eggs.
* Total eggs needed: 45 eggs.
* Number of baskets: 45 eggs / 9 eggs/basket = 5 baskets

**3. Determine the babysitting frequency:**

* Sandra gets 9 eggs per babysitting session.
* She needs 5 baskets of eggs.
*  Number of babysitting sessions: 5 baskets / 1 session/basket = 5 sessions

**Here's how to break down the problem:**

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'S' represent Seth's current age.
*  Let 'B' represent Brooke's current age.

**2. Translate the Given Information into Equations:**

*  ""Seth is twice as old as Brooke""  translates to: S = 2B 
*  ""In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28"" translates to: S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 

**3. Solve for S (Seth's age):**

*  Simplify the second equation: S + B + 4 = 28
*  Rewrite the equation to isolate S: S = 28 - B - 4
*  Combine terms: S = 24 - B 

**4. Substitute the First Equation:**

*  Substitute the equation S = 2B into the modified second equation: 2B = 24 - B
*  Combine like terms: 3B = 24

**5. Solve for B (Brooke's age):**

*  Divide both sides of the equation by 3:  B = 8

**6. Find Seth's Age:**

 * Substitute the value of B into the equation S = 2B: S = 2 * 8
 * Solve for S:  S = 16


**{The final answer is 16.}** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the Task:** Billy is prepping potatoes for potato salad, aiming to complete the task.
2. **Information gathering:**
   - Number of potatoes: 60
   - Time to peel: 1.5 minutes
   - Time to cut: 5 seconds
3. **Calculate total time per potato:** 
   - Total time per potato = Time to peel + Time to cut = 1.5 minutes + 5 seconds 
4. **Convert to Seconds:**  
   - 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
   - (Therefore the total time per potato = 90 seconds + 5 seconds).
5. **Calculate Total Prep Time:** 
   - Total prep time = (Time per potato) * (Number of potatoes) 
   - Total prep time = 95 seconds * 60 potatoes.


{The final answer is 5700 seconds}



<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

Let's say ""x"" represents the number of Chinese people who are not Japanese. We can set up an equation based on the information we have.
 *Number of Chinese:* 240 (total Asians) - 80 (Japanese) = 160 Chinese people
 *Number of boys:* 60 



*Step 3:* **Solve for the unknown**
We can use our previously identified equation to solve for the number of Chinese people (x).


*Step 4:* **Double check for reasonableness**
 Make sure your answer is reasonable considering the context of the problem.


{The final answer is} 
 


You've done well! It looks like a solid process for approaching the problem. I hope it helps.  
<end_of_turn><eos>","If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.
Since there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, there were 160-60 = 100 girls in the Chinese team.

If Zaid earns 6000$ per month, how much money will he , still have after all these expenses and donations?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate rent expense**

* Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent: (1/4) * 6000$ = 1500$

**Step 2: Calculate car fuel expense**

* Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel: (1/3) * 6000$ = 2000$

**Step 3: Calculate total expenses**

*  Add the rent and car fuel expenses: 1500$ + 2000$ = 3500$

**Step 4: Calculate money remaining after expenses**

*  Subtract the total expenses from Zaid's salary: 6000$ - 3500$ = 2500$

**Step 5: Calculate charity donation**
* Zaid donates half of the remaining amount: (1/2) * 2500$ = 1250$

**Step 6: Calculate remaining amount after charity donation**

* Subtract the charity donation from the money remaining: 2500$ - 1250$ = 1250$

**Step 7: Calculate amounts given to his daughter and wife**

* Zaid gives his daughter 200$ and his wife 700$: 200$ + 700$ = 900$


**Final Answer:** {The final answer is 1250$ }    


 
<end_of_turn><eos>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500
Car fuel costs him 1/3*$6000 = $<<6000*1/3=2000>>2000
Total expenses amount to $2000+$1500 = $<<2000+1500=3500>>3500
The total amount of money he remains with is $6000-$3500 = $<<6000-3500=2500>>2500
He donates half of the remaining amount, which is 1/2*$2500 = $<<1/2*2500=1250>>1250
The total amount of money given to his wife and daughter is $200+$700 = $<<200+700=900>>900

{The final answer is}
                    

Here's the breakdown of the solution step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We are given information about the number of crabs for three people: Rani, Monic, and Bo.
* We need to find the total number of crabs they have together.

**2. Break Down the Components:**

* **Bo:** Has 40 crabs.
* **Monic:** Has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
* **Rani:** Has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

**3. Calculate the Total:**

* Add the number of crabs for each person: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122 crabs

 
 **4. Answer:**

{The final answer is} 122 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.
Bo and Monic have a total of 36+40 = <<36+40=76>>76 crabs.
Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.

**Step 1: Determine the number of white carnations.**
* Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.
* Therefore, white carnations = 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = 40 white carnations. 

**Step 2: Determine the number of red roses.**
* Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations 
* Therefore, red roses = 40 white carnations * 4 = 160 red roses.

{The final answer is ...}

**Solution**

1. **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'M' represent Mark's current age. 
    * Let 'J' represent Jean's current age.

2. **Set up Equations Based on the Information Given:**
    *  ""Jean is two years older than Mark"":  J = M + 2
    *  ""Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half Jan's age"": This means:  (M - 2) = (J - 2) / 2

3. **Solve for Mark's Age (M):**
    * Since we know Jan's age is 30, we can use the equation we just set up for M:
       * (M - 2) = (30 - 2) / 2
       * (M - 2) = 14
       * M - 2 = 14
       * M = 16

4. **Solve for Jean's Age (J):**
    * Substitute Mark’s age into either of the original equations to solve for J. Let's use J = M + 2:
       * J = 16 + 2
       * J = 18.


    

**Answer:** 
{The final answer is 18}

Let's break this problem down step-by-step.

**Step 1: Define the Variables**

*  Let `x` represent the time (in seconds) that the faster team's first runner takes to complete the 400 meters.
*  The slower team's runners' times will follow a pattern:
    * The second runner will take `x + 3` seconds.
    * The third runner will take `x + 3 + 3` seconds.
    * And so on...
 


**Step 2: Total Time Calculation**

To find out the faster team's overall time, we need to add together the total time each of their runners takes to complete their legs:

* Total time for the faster team: `x` + `55`


**Step 3: Calculate the Slower Team's Time**

* To find the slower team's time, we'll calculate the time for each runner. 
* We need to incorporate the extra time for each of the slower team's runners.
    *  `x + 3 + (3 + 3) + (3 + 3 + 3) + (3 + 3 + 3 + 3)`

**Step 4: Determine the Win by Calculation**

* To find out by how much the faster team wins: 
    *  `Total Time for Faster Team - Total Time for Slower Team` 




**You'd need to finish writing out the calculations to find the exact differences between the times. 



**Final Answer**: {The final answer is}
<end_of_turn><eos>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

*This prompts the student to consider the probability of different outcomes and to calculate the probability of rare events.*


Solution:

1. **Probability of rolling a number greater than 3**
   *  There are six possible outcomes on a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. 
   *  The numbers greater than 3 are: 4, 5, and 6. 
   *  Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
   
2. **Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row**
   * There are three even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. 
   * The probability of rolling one even number is 3/6 (3/6) 
  
3. **Comparison and Calculation**

*  To determine the likelihood of one of these outcomes happening versus another, we need to understand how they compare. If we have a higher probability for a specific event, that suggests it's more likely to happen.


4. **Expressing the answer as a percentage**
  * This calculation can be difficult to determine visually. 



Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any specific step or provide a calculated value! 



<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

   - Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, who picked 20.
   - Jenna's apples = 20 / 2 = 10 apples.

* **Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples.**
   - Jenna picked 10 apples and her mom picked 20, for a total of 10 + 20 = 30 apples.

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**  
    * Let 'R' be the number of rats in each cage.

2. **Identify the Information:**
    *  Rats get 6 pieces of straw per rat.
    *  There are 10 cages of rats in equal groups.

3. **Set up the Equation:**
    * The total straw distributed to the rats is 160 pieces. 
    * Thus, 6*R  = 160 

4. **Solve for the Number of Rats per Cage:**
    * Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate R.
    *  R = 160 / 6
    *  R = 26.67 (Since we're dealing with rats and whole numbers, adjust for the round off). 
   

{The final answer is 27 rats.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the interest for one month**
* Interest per month = 2% of $100 = (2/100) * $100 = $2.

**2.  Calculate the total interest over three months**
* Total interest = $2 per month * 3 months = $6.

**3.  Calculate the total amount owed after three months** 
* Total amount = Original debt + Total interest 
* Total amount = $100 + $6 = $106. 

**4. Determine the payment Mandy should make.** Since Mandy paid after 3 months, her final payment should be: 
* Total amount owed = Original debt – Total interest = $106 


{The final answer is $106} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.

If they agreed : to , split all : the costs evenly, ! how much did each ! of : them pay?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the cost of the food.

**Step 2: Set up Equations**

*  Ticket cost: $20.25
*  Food cost: $20.25 - x 
*  Cost of two rides: 2 * $33 = $66
*  Total cost: $20.25 - x + $66 = $86.25 - x

**Step 3:  Express the overall cost**

* They split all costs evenly, so each friend's share is represented as: ( $86.25 - x ) / 3 

**Step 4:  Solve for x**

* Use the fact that they spent $4.50 less on food. This translates to:  $86.25 - x - $4.50 

* $86.25 - x = $86.25 - $4.50

**Step 5: Final answer**
* The final answer is {The final answer is: $(86.25 - x) / 3$}.



 
<end_of_turn><eos>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.
They spent $33 x 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66 for the rides.
They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

Here's the solution

**Step 1: Determine the amount of insects per week per duck.**

* The problem states that ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each week. 
* This means that one duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of insects per day per duck.**
 
* There are 7 days in a week. 
* To find the insects per day, divide the weekly amount by 7.
* 3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds of insects per day

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of insects needed per day for a flock of ten ducks.**
 
* Multiply the insects needed per day per duck by the number of ducks in the flock.
*  0.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 5 pounds of insects per day


**The final answer is:** 5 pounds of insects they need per day.  
<end_of_turn><eos>","The flock needs 35 pounds per week because 10 x 3.5 = <<10*3.5=35>>35

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Starting Trees:**

*  Tom begins with 50 trees.

**2. Planting Rate:**

* He plants 10 trees per year.

**3. Chopping Rate:** 

* He chops down 2 trees each year.  

**4.  Tree Growth:** 

*  After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. We need to calculate the number of trees left. 

**5. Calculation:** 

* **Year 10:**
   * Trees planted: 10 trees
   * Trees chopped down: -2 trees
 
Let's calculate how many trees remain

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink , plastic flamingos to the collection. At noon on Sunday, how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the number of white flamingos:**

* The neighbors took back one-third of the flamingos, so they removed 18 pink flamingos / 3 = 6 white flamingos

**2. Find the total number of white and pink flamingos:**

* The total number of pink and white flamingos was 18 pink + 6 white = 24 flamingos.

**3. Find the difference between pink and white flamingos:**

* The difference between the number of pink and white flamingos was18 pink - 6 white = 12 pink flamingos. 


**The final answer is:** 12 
<end_of_turn><eos>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

*Explain each step in the sentence.*

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the problem:**  The problem is asking how much change Violetta will get when she buys new crayons from a store.

2. **Important Information:** We know:
    * Violetta wants to buy crayons.
    * She needs 5 different colors of crayons
    * She has $20.
    * One crayon costs $2.

3. **Calculate Cost of Crayons:** We first need to figure out how much the 5 different colored crayons will cost. We multiply the cost per crayon by the number of crayons to find that the cost of the crayons for all five colors is 5 x $2 = $10.

4. **Calculate Change:** Finally, we can find the change by subtracting the cost of the crayons from Violetta's budget.  This gives us $20 - $10 = $10. 

{The final answer is $10} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.
If she pays $20, she will get 20 - 10 = $<<20-10=10>>10 of change.

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Find the cost of a pencil and eraser:**

*  A pencil costs $1.20
*  An eraser costs $0.30
*  Combined cost: $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

**2. Find the cost of a pen:**

*  A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. 
*  Therefore, a pen costs $1.50

**3. Calculate the cost of 8 pens:**

*  Cost of 1 pen: $1.50
*  Cost of 8 pens: $1.50 * 8 = $12.00 {The final answer is $12.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

*Note* : You can use appropriate notation such as ""∈"" (belongs to) for your reasoning. 

**Solution:**

1. **Define the unknowns:**
   - Let 'C' represent the number of children in Soda.
   
2. **Set up an equation:** 
   - The total number of inhabitants is equal to the number of men + the number of women + the number of children. This is written as: men + women + children = total inhabitants
   - We are given these values: 8417 men, 9092 women, and 23786 total inhabitants.

3. **Substitute the known values:** 
   -  8417 + 9092 + C = 23786

   
4. **Solve for C:**
   - Combine the known numbers on the left side: 17509 + C = 23786

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1.  Initial Cards:**

*  Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards.

**2.  Collection in the Second Month:**

*  She collected three times the number she had in the first month.
*  We need to find out how many cards she collected in the second month.


**3.  Cards Collected in the First Month &  Second Month:**

*  We need to calculate the amount of cards collected.


**4.  Collection in the Third Month:**

*  She collected twice the combined amount of the first and second months.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define the variables:**

* Let **x** be the rate that Publisher A pays per sentence.
* Let **2x** be the rate that Publisher B pays per sentence.
* **y** be the total earnings for the week.


**Step 2: Translate the given information into an equation:**

* We know that Mark earns a total of 1000 sentences in a week.
* Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so the earnings from Publisher A is 1000 * 5 = 5000 cents.
* Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so the earnings from Publisher B is 1000 * 2x = 2000x cents.
* The total earnings for the week is the sum of the earnings from both publishers. 
* Therefore: 5000 + 2000x = y {The equation} 

**Step 3: Solve for x:**

* We know that Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence. 
* We can represent the equation: 5000 + 2000x = y


{The final answer is} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.
From Publisher A, he earns 5 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<5*500=2500>>2500 cents.
Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

* Baldur gets water from a well.
* Quantity of water from the well in the morning: 5 pails.
* Quantity of water from the well in the afternoon: 6 pails.
* Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

**2. Calculate the total daily pail water usage:**

* Morning pail water = 5 pails
* Afternoon pail water = 6 pails 
* Total pail water usage per day = 5 + 6 = 11 pails.

**3. Determine total daily water consumption:**

* Since each pail contains 5 liters, the total liters of water consumption per day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters

* **Total Acreage:** Josie's farm has 10 acres.
* **Grape Yield per Acre:** Each acre yields 5 tons of grapes per year.
* **Wine Conversion:** Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine.

**2. Determine the Relationship Between Grapes and Wine**

We need to find out how many barrels of wine can be produced from her grapes. To do this, we'll link the acreage given with the grape yield. 

**3. Calculate Total Wine Production**

* **Total Grapes:**  10 acres * 5 tons/acre = 50 tons of grapes.
* **Total Wine:** 50 tons of grapes * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine.


**The final answer is:** 100 barrels of wine.

*  
Solution:

1. **Calculate cheese used in sandwiches per day:**
   -  He uses 2 slices per sandwich. 
   -  He eats a sandwich every day.

2. **Calculate cheese used in omelets per day:**
   - He uses 1 extra slice per omelet.
   -  He has 3 days of omelets. 
   - Total slices in omelets: 2 slices/sandwich * 3 days = 6 slices

3. **Calculate total cheese use for sandwiches:** 
   - He uses 2 slices/sandwich per day.
   - Total slices in sandwiches: 2 slices/sandwich * 7 days = 14 slices

4. **Calculate total cheese used for omelets:**
   - He uses 1 extra slice per omelet.
   - Total slices in omelets: 2 slices/sandwich * 3 days = 6 slices

5. **Calculate total cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - He uses 8 slices of cheese in macaroni and cheese. 

6. **Calculate total cheese slices:**
   - Total slices in sandwiches: 14 slices
   - Total slices in omelets: 6 slices
   - Total slices in macaroni and cheese: 8 slices 
   


{The final answer is 38 slices of cheese} 


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

{The final answer is} 


Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the initial total:**

* Start with the green pens: 22
* Add the yellow pens: 22 + 10 = 32 pens

**2.  Determine the number of blue pens:**

* Multiply the number of blue pens bags by the number of pens in each bag: 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 pens

**3. Determine the number of red pens:**

* Multiply the number of red pens bags by the number of pens in each bag: 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 pens

**4. Calculate the final total:**

* Add all the pens together: 32 + 54 + 12 = 98 pens


{The final answer is} 98
<end_of_turn><eos>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.

{The final answer is 93}.


Here's the breakdown of the solution:
**1. Calculate the current average:**

* Add the scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
* Divide the sum by the number of tests: 438 / 6 = 73

**2. Determine the target average:**

* Mr. Bert wants the average to be 93. 

**3. Calculate the desired final score:** 

*  Target average - current average = desired score
* 93 - 73 = 20         
 
{The final answer is 93}



<end_of_turn><eos>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate total kilometers from the first phase:**
    * Micheal rode his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks, so he'll cover 5 rides/week * 4 weeks * 25 kilometers/ride = 500 kilometers.
2. **Calculate total kilometers from the second phase:** 
    * Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week for 3 weeks, so he'll cover 2 rides/week * 3 weeks * 60 kilometers/ride = 360 kilometers. 
3. **Add the two phases' total distances:**

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the weight of one candied apple in grams. 

**2.  Set Up Equations**

* **Equation 1 (Weight of Chocolate Bars):**  Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, meaning 40g (weight of a chocolate bar) = 2x (weight of a candied apple).

* **Equation 2 (Total Weight):** The bag contains 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. So, the total weight is 25 * 40g (chocolate bar weight) + 80 * x g (candied apple weight)

 
**3. Solve for 'x' (weight of one candied apple)**

* Using the equation 1: 40g = 2x. Therefore, x = 20g

**4. Calculate the Total Weight**

* Substitute the value of 'x' into the equation 2: 25 * 40g + 80 * 20g.
* Calculate the weights for each part: 1000g + 1600g

**5.  Answer**

The final answer is {The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams} .




<end_of_turn><eos>","The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.
The chocolate bars weigh 40*25=<<40*25=1000>>1000 grams in total.

*Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
*  x = the total cost of one cup
 

*Step 2: Set up the Equation

The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6,000 each. This translates to the equation:
* 20 * 12 = 1200 + ( 0.5 * 6000)
 
This must be simplified further

*Step 3: Solve the Equation 
* 240 = 1200 + 3000
 
We can simplify further:
* 240 = 4200

This equation can be simplified:

{The final answer is }


  <end_of_turn><eos>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

**Here's how to break down the problem:**

**1. Calculate the cost of the jacket and shoes:**

* Jacket cost: $30
* Cost of each pair of shoes: $20
* Total cost of jacket and shoes: $30 + (2 * $20) = $30 + $40 = $70

Let's break it down step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let `r` represent the number of red chickens. 
* Let `w` represent the number of white chickens.

**2. Set Up Equations**

* We know the total number of chickens:  `r + w = flock_size`
* We know the number of eggs produced daily by red chickens: `3r`
* We know the number of eggs produced daily by white chickens: `5w`
* We know the number of eggs collected each day: `42` 

**3. Solve for One Variable** 

* We can use the equation `r + w = flock_size` to express one variable in terms of the other.  Solve for `r`:
   * `r = flock_size - w`

**4. Substitute**

* Substitute the expression for `r` from step 3 into the equation for the number of red chickens: 
  * `3(flock_size - w) = 42`

**5. Solve for the Other Variable** 

*  Simplify and solve the equation for `w`:
   * `3flock_size - 3w = 42`
   * `3w = 3flock_size - 42`
   * `w = flock_size - 14`
  
**6. Utilize the Equation with Known variables** 

*  We know that `w = flock_size - 14`. We can plug this into the equation `r + w = flock_size`.  
* `r + (flock_size - 14) = flock_size`.
*  


**7. Final Step**

* The final equation is: `r + flock_size - 14 = flock_size`

*




<end_of_turn><eos>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

{The final answer is}

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understanding the problem:**

* We know Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour.
* We know the park's dimensions – it's a rectangle measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles.

**2. Defining the task:**

* Our goal is to calculate the time Gary takes to walk the entire perimeter of the park.


**3. Finding the perimeter of the park:**

* The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and its width (Perimeter = 2 * Length + 2 * Width)
* Perimeter = 2 * 1.5 miles + 2 * 6 miles 
* Perimeter = 3 miles + 12 miles 
* Perimeter = 15 miles

**4. Calculating the time:**

* Time = Distance / Speed
* Time = 15 miles / 3 miles/hour
* Time = 5 hours

 
**5. The final answer:**

{The final answer is} 5 hours. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles
Then find the length of the two short sides of the park: 1.5 miles * 2 = <<1.5*2=3>>3 miles
Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

**1. Define Variables**

*   Let 'x' represent the initial amount of water in the small pool. 

**2. Set up Equations Based on the Problem Information**

*   **Step 2a: Time Before**
   *  The big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.  
  
    This translates to an equation: _2x = x_
*   **Step 2b: Time Now**
   *  Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. 
  
    This translates to an equation: _4x = 4x_
   


**3. Solve for x**
 
*   **Step 3a: Simplify Equation 2a**
    *  _2x = x_ can be simplified to _x = 0_

*   **Step 3b: Simplify Equation 2b**
   *  _4x = 4x_ .  This equation tells us nothing new about the water in the pool


**4.  Answer the question**

* The final answer is {The small pool has 0 gallons of water}. 



Let me know if you're ready to tackle a similar problem. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

Here's a breakdown of the thought process:

**1. Define the problem:**

* Lori wants to buy shoes costing $320.00 and a matching belt costing $32.00.
* She has a job that pays her $8.00 per hour.
* We need to figure out how many hours she needs to work.

**2. Calculate the total cost:**

* The shoes cost $320.00.
* The belt costs $32.00.
* Total cost: $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00 

**3. Determine Lori's hourly earnings:**

* She earns $8.00 per hour. 

**4. Set up an equation:**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of hours Lori needs to work.
*  To find the number of hours, we need to set up the equation: $8x = $352.00

**5. Solve for 'x':** 

*  Divide both sides of the equation by $8:
     $352.00 / $8 = $x

*The  final answer is $44 hours




<end_of_turn><eos>","She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00
Her purchase will total $352.00 and she makes $8.00 at her part-time job so she'll have to work 352/8 = <<352/8=44>>44 hours

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the additional amount:** 
    * 10% of $2000 is (10/100) * $2000 = $200.

2. **Calculate the total amount to be repaid:**
    *  Janeth's total repayment is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

3. **Determine her monthly payment in dollars:**
    * Janeth pays $165 each month for 12 months

4. **Calculate the total monthly payment:**
   * The total payment is $165 * 12 = $1980.

5. **Determine the remaining balance:**
    * The remaining balance is $2200 - $1980 = $220.


{The final answer is $220} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

Here's how to solve it:

* **Understand the problem:** We know there are 4 roses, and there are 7 more dahlias than roses. We need to find the total number of flowers in the vase.
* **Find the number of dahlias:**  Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.
* **Calculate the total:** To find the total, add the number of roses and dahlias.  So, 4 + 11 = 15 flowers 




{The final answer is} 15 flowers <end_of_turn><eos>","There are 4 + 7 = <<4+7=11>>11 dahlias in the vase.
In total there are 4 + 11 = <<4+11=15>>15 flowers in the vase.

*step-by-step solution
1. **Find Zack's age.** 
    * Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old. 
2. **Find Adrian's age.** 
    * Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.  
3. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years.**
    *  To calculate the average age in three years, we calculate the sum of their ages in 3 years, then divide that sum by 3.
 
4. **Calculate the total age in 3 years.** 
    * Zack in 3 years will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
    * Adrian in 3 years will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
    * Harriet in 3 years will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
     
5. **Find the average age in 3 years.**

In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

*  Naomi's points:  x + y + z = 251
*  Naomi's points:  68 points 

   
**3. Solve for Yuri's Points (y):**

*   We know Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:  y = 0.5x + 10

**4. Solve for Brianna's Points (x):** 

*  We know Naomi's points:  x + y + z = 251
*  We know Naomi's points:  68 points

**5. Solve for Jojo's Points (z):**

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    * Andy plants 90 geraniums.
    * He plants fewer petunias than geraniums, which means he plants fewer petunias.

2. **Define the unknown:**
    * We need to find out how many petunias Andy plants.
    
3. **Set up an equation:**
    *  Let 'x' represent the number of petunias.
    *  We know he plants 90 geraniums, and fewer petunias than geraniums, so the equation is: 90 = x + 40

4. **Solve for x (number of petunias):** 
    * Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 90 - 40 = x + 40 - 40
    *  This simplifies to: 50 = x 

5. **Find the total number of flowers:**
    *  Total flowers = geraniums + petunias

Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?<end_of_turn>
 
Here's how to solve it step by step:
 
**Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.**
*  30% of 120 watermelons = (30/100) * 120 = 36 watermelons
 
**Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months.**
*  Initial watermelons - watermelons ready = watermelons remaining
*  120 - 36 = 84 watermelons 
 
**Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks.**
* 3/4 of 84 watermelons = (3/4) * 84 = 63 watermelons
 
**Step 4: Calculate the number of watermelons not ready.**
*  Watermelons remaining - watermelons ready = watermelons not ready
*  84 - 63 = 21 watermelons 


{The final answer is 21}  
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.
The number of watermelons remaining on the farm is 120-36 =<<120-36=84>>84
When she returned two weeks later, she found that 3/4*84 = <<3/4*84=63>>63 were ready for harvest,
The number of watermelons that were not ready is 84-63 =<<84-63=21>>21

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the cars:**

*  Cost per car: $20,000
*  Number of cars: 12
*  Total cost of cars: $20,000 * 12 = $240,000

**2. Calculate the tax on the car purchase:**

*  Tax rate: 10%
*  Total cost of cars: $240,000
*  Tax amount on cars: $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000

**3. Calculate the registration fee for each car:** 

*  Registration fee per car: $1,000

**4. Calculate the total cost of registration:**

*  Registration fee per car: $1,000
*  Number of cars: 12
*  Total registration cost: $1,000 * 12 = $12,000


**5. Calculate the total cost** 

*  Total cost of cars: $240,000
*  Tax amount on cars: $24,000
*  Registration cost: $12,000
*  Total cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000



{The final answer is $276,000} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000
So the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000
So the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000
Registration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000
So his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000

*Please make sure to properly articulate the thought process*.

**Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:**

**Step 1: Determine how many fries Billy took.**
   - Kyle took 5 fries.
   - Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 5 * 2 = 10 fries.

**Step 2: Determine how many fries Kyle took.**
   - Kyle took 5 fries.

**Step 3: Determine how many fries Colby took.**
   - Kyle took 5 fries, and Billy took 10 fries. 
   - Colby took 3 less than Kyle's amount, meaning he took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. 

**Step 4: Determine how many fries were left after Kyle and Billy took them.**
   - Griffin started with 24 fries.
   - Kyle and Billy took 5 + 10 = 15 fries
  - Therefore, there were 24 - 15 = 9 fries left.


**Step 5: Determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.**
   - Griffin had 9 fries left.
   - Ginger gave him a handful of fries and Griffin had 27 fries.



{The final answer is 7.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27
Thus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries

                    question:
                    There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is ; twice the amount of fish : in both aquariums. If both aquariums have the ! same number of fish in them, how many fish are there in each aquarium?<end_of_turn>
 
 Here's how I'll solve the problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' represent the number of fish in each aquarium. 

**2. Formulate Equations**

* **Equation 1 (Snails):**  The number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32. This can be written as:  4 + x = 32 
* **Equation 2:** The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in each aquarium. We can rewrite this as: 32 - 4 = 2x 
 
**3. Solve for x**

* **Solve for x in Equation 1:** 
   * 4 + x = 32
   * x = 32 - 4 
   * x = 28

* **Solve for x in Equation 2:**
   * 32 - 4 = 2x
   * 28 = 2x
   * x = 14

 

**4. Answer the Question**

*The final answer is: There are 14 fish in each aquarium.* 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.
There are 28/2 = <<28/2=14>>14 fish in both aquariums.
There are 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 fish in each aquarium.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the total earnings per week:**
   * Hourly rate: $250
   * Working hours per day: 6 hours
   * Days of work per week: 4
   * Total weekly earnings: $250/hour * 6 hours/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week 

**2. Calculate the total earnings over 5 weeks:**
   * Total earnings for 5 weeks: $6000/week * 5 weeks = $30,000

**3. Calculate the discount amount:**
   * Discount percentage: 10%
   * Discount amount: $30,000 * 0.10 = $3000

**4. Calculate the final payment amount:**
  * Final payment: $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000 {The final answer is $27,000}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Find out how many times Anne went down the slide.**

*  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, meaning she went down 30% of 30 times.
* 30 * 0.30 = 9 times 

**2. Find out how many times Anne went down the slide.**

*  Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, so, she went down  30 times.

**3. Find out how many times Robert went down the slide.**

* Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, meaning he went down 4 * 30 times 

**4. Simplify the number.**


* Robert went down the slide 120 times. 



{The final answer is 120} <end_of_turn><eos>","Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel who went down 30 times so that's .30*30 = <<30*.01*30=9>>9 times less

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of cows in all the stalls.**
   *  There are 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows in the stalls.

2. **Determine the number of cows to put into each stall with the new groups.**
   * Mr. Sylas puts the new cows into each of the 10 stalls equally. 
   * Since there are 200 cows, he divides the total cows by the number of cows per stall: 200 cows / 20 cows/stall = 10 stalls. 


3. **Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls.**
   *  The answer is 8 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 160 cows

 {The final answer is 160} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.
Each of the stalls gets four cows, meaning a total of 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 cows are placed into eight of the stalls.
Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Convert the amounts to dollars:**

* **Pennies:** 100 pennies = $0.10
* **Nickels:** 40 nickels = $0.40
* **Dimes:** 20 dimes = $2.00
* **Dollar bills:** 40 dollar bills = $40.00

**2. Calculate the total amount in dollars:**

 $0.10 + $0.40 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $42.50


 {The final answer is $42.50} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the weight of the wood consumed by termites.**

*  Multiply the weight of each section by the percentage of wood consumed by termites: 400 pounds * 0.30 = 120 pounds

**2. Calculate the weight of the remaining wood.**

*  Subtract the weight of the termite-consumed wood from the total weight of the wood per section: 400 pounds - 120 pounds = 280 pounds

**3. Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree.**

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Find the total number of cookies Carla needs to bake.**
   * Carla needs to bake 36 cookies today + 30 cookies tomorrow = 66 cookies.

**2. Determine the number of cups of flour needed per dozen cookies.** 
   *  Two cups of flour are needed to make one dozen cookies.

**3. Calculate the total cups of flour needed.**
   * Carla needs 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozen cookies
   *  Carla needs 5.5 dozen cookies * 2 cups of flour per dozen is 11 cups of flour. {The final answer is 11 cups}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.

* We have 6,200 pennies.  
* A penny is worth $0.01.
* The total dollar amount is equal to the number of Pennies times the value of a penny.

**Step 3:  Calculate the total dollar amount** 

* Total dollar amount  = 6,200 pennies * $0.01/penny
* Total dollar amount= $62

**Step 4: State the final answer.**

How ; much . more is the total ! price of the house . than Mrs. ; Cruz's budget?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the brokerage fee:**

* The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350,000.
* Brokerage fee = 0.05 * $350,000 = $17,500

**2. Calculate the transfer fee:**

* The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350,000.
* Transfer fee = 0.12 * $350,000 = $42,000

**3. Calculate the total additional costs:**

* Total additional costs = Brokerage fee + Transfer fee 
* Total additional costs = $17,500 + $42,000 = $59,500

**4. Calculate the total price of the house:**

* Total price of the house = Selling price + Additional costs 
* Total price of the house = $350,000 + $59,500 = $409,500

**5.  Determine the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget:**

* Difference = Total price of the house - Mrs. Cruz's budget
* Difference = $409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500 


**{The final answer is $9,500}**



<end_of_turn><eos>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.
The transfer fee is $350 000 x 12/100 = $<<350000*12/100=42000>>42000.
The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total transfer fees.**

*  The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price, which is $400,000 x 0.03 = $12,000.

**2. Calculate the total brokerage fees.**

*  The brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price, which is $400,000 x 0.05 = $20,000.

**3. Calculate the total costs.**

*  Total costs are the sum of transfer fees and brokerage fees: $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

**4. Calculate the net cost after the remaining loan.**

*  The remaining loan cost amount is $250,000.

**5. Calculate the net proceeds.**

*  Subtract the total costs from the selling price to find the net proceeds: $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000 = $0

This problem requires a bit of careful breakdown and tracking of time changes. 

**Here's how to tackle it step-by-step**

1. **Identify Existing Timeframes:**
    * The problem tells us the initial heating time: 20 minutes to reach 300 degrees.
    * There's a longer heating period: 40% longer (meaning 40% increase in time), leading to 400 degrees.
    * Time to cook is determined after the oil has warmed to 400 degrees.
    * The cooking process takes 5 minutes *less* than the heating process.

2. **Calculate New Heating Time:**
    *  40% increase in time means calculating the new duration for the oil to reach 400 degrees. 
    *  We'll need to calculate a percentage increase of the initial 20-minute heating time, 

3. **Determine Cooking Time:**
    *  The problem provides information about how long it takes to warm up and cook.
    
 

Let me know if you'd like me to work through the calculation in more detail, including the exact calculation for the new heating time percentage!
<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300
So it takes 20+8=<<20+8=28>>28 minutes to warm up
So the total warming time was 28+20=<<28+20=48>>48 minutes
So it took 48-5=<<48-5=43>>43 minutes to cook the chicken
So it took 48+43=<<48+43=91>>91 minutes to make the chicken.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Cost of Newspaper Ads:**
   - The agent spent $5 per ad on newspaper ads.
   -  Number of newspaper ads: 50
   - Cost of newspaper ads: $5 * 50 = $250 

2. **Cost of Television Ads:**

   - Number of television ads: 15
   - Cost of television ads: $75 * 15 = $1125

3. **Total Cost:**

*To solve this problem, you will need to break it down by step.*

**Step 1: Define Variables**
*Let 's' represent the number of stitches in each sleeve.


**Step 2: Set up equations based on provided information**
* **Body Stitches:** 900 stitches
   * The body requires 900 stitches. 
* **Collar Stitches:** 900 stitches * (1/10) = 90 stitches
* **Rosette Stitches:** 90 stitches * 2 = 180 stitches
* **Total Stitches:** 1800 stitches

**Step 3: Use the total stitches information to find 's' (stitches per sleeve).**
* 900 + 90 + 180 = 1800 
**Step 4: Solve for 's'.** 
* Combine the stitches from the body and the collar into a single number
 

{The final answer is 18}


 

<end_of_turn><eos>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    - Number of tomato packets: 20
    - Price per tomato packet: $40
    - Number of celery packets: 80
    - Price per celery packet: $30

2. **Determine the cost of the tomato seeds:** 
   - Multiply the number of tomato packets by the price per packet: 20 * $40 = $800

3. **Determine the cost of the celery seeds:**
   - Multiply the number of celery packets by the price per packet: 80 * $30 = $2400 

4. **Calculate the total cost of the seeds:**
   - Add the cost of tomato seeds and the cost of celery seeds: $800 + $2400 = $3200

**The final answer is $3200** .

Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

*  Let 'x' represent the number of lines in the first scene.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of lines in the second scene.
*  Let 'z' represent the number of lines in Sean's solo song. 

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**

* **First Scene:**  x = 2y (The first scene has twice the number of lines as the second scene)
* **Lines in the First Scene:**  x = 2y  and x = (1/3) * z (The first scene has a third of the lines of the solo song)
* **Second Scene:** y = z + 6 (The second scene has 6 more lines than the song)
* **Lines in the Second Scene:** y = (4/5) * z ( Four-fifths of the lines of the second scene is Sean’s)


**Step 3: Solve the Equations**

We now have a system of equations that could be solved manually or with the help of algebra techniques to find the value of x, y, and z.

**Step 4: Final Calculation**


To find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we can add the lines from all three scenes:  x + y + z


 
**Final Answer:** 
{The final answer is 276 lines} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

**Solution**

1. **Calculate the time for one small hole:** Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole. 
2. **Calculate the time for all 30 small holes:** Multiply time per small hole by the number of small holes: 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.
3. **Convert the time for all small holes into hours:** Divide the time for small holes (90 minutes) by 60 minutes/hour: 90 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1.5 hours.
4. **Calculate the time for one large hole:** Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
5. **Calculate the time for all 15 large holes:**  Multiply time per large hole by the number of large holes: 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.
6. **Convert the time for all large holes into hours:** Divide the time for large holes (150 minutes) by 60 minutes/hour: 150 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2.5 hours.   
7. **Calculate the total time:** Add the time for small holes and large holes: 1.5 hours + 2.5 hours = 4 hours 


{The final answer is 4 hours}   
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes

Here's how we can break down the problem and understand it step-by-step:

**1. Identifying the Problem:**

* The problem focuses on two friends, Mico and Marco, who want to get to know each other better.
* A key relationship they discover is that the sum of their ages is 20.
* We are then asked to find the sum of their ages in ten years.

**2.  Understanding the Key Terms:**

* **Ages:** The numerical value of how old each person is.
* **Sum:** The total of the two individual numbers (ages in this case). 
* **Years:**  Time passing, indicated as a numerical value.
* **In 10 years:** This tells us we are considering a future scenario, where the focus is on the ages in 10 years.


**3. Determining the Solution Approach:**

* **Step 1**:  Figure out how to calculate the sum of their ages.
* **Step 2**: Apply this calculation in 10 years.

**4.  Calculations:**


*  **Without knowing the ages themselves, we can't solve the problem for a specific number.**

**5.  Possible Outcomes:**

* **Scenario 1**:  We need more information (ages) as that is the base of the problem.

 
**6. Final Answer:** 

{The final answer is not possible to determine without knowing the ages of Mico and Marco.}



Let me know if you would like to work through a similar problem with specific ages! <end_of_turn><eos>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                    question:
                    Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. In 9 ! years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem: 

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let 'R' be Ruby's current age.
* Let 'S' be Sam's current age.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **Equation 1:** ""Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.""  
   * This translates to: R = 6S
* **Equation 2:** ""In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam."" 
   * This translates to: R + 9 = 3(S + 9) 

**Step 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other**

Let's solve Equation 1 for 'R':
* R = 6S

**Step 4: Substitute the value of the variable into the second equation**

Substitute '6S' for 'R' in Equation 2:
* (6S) + 9 = 3(S + 9)

**Step 5: Simplify and solve for the remaining variable**

* 6S + 9 = 3S + 27
* 3S = 18
* S = 6

**Step 6: The answer**

 Sam is currently 6 years old. {The final answer is 6}


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define the variables:**

*   Let  `x` represent the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace. 

**2.  Set up the equation:**

*   The length of the topaz gemstones is 1 inch.
*   The length of the sterling silver beads is 1/4 inch.
*   The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
*   Therefore, the equation that represents the necklace's length, based on the gemstones and beads, is:  
    `8 topaz + x beads = 25 inches`

**3.  Solve for `x`:**


*   This equation can be rewritten as 8 topaz + x = 25 
*   Subtracted 8 topaz from both sides of the equation to isolate `x` :  
   `x = 25 - 8 topaz` 



**4.  Find the total length of the topaz gemstones:**

*   `8 topaz`

**5. Final answer:**



{The final answer is 17 sterling silver beads} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.
Since each necklace is 25 inches in length, then there are 25-8=<<25-8=17>>17 inches of space between gemstones.
Since Katerina uses one-quarter inch sterling silver beads to fill space between gemstones, then she will require 17*4=<<17*4=68>>68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

His total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120
Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.
When Margot doubled the number of stories she wrote in the first week in the second week, she wrote 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 stories in the second week.
In total, she wrote 60+120= <<60+120=180>>180 stories.
Altogether, the three siblings wrote 180+180 = <<180+180=360>>360 stories in the two weeks.

                    question:
                    If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is ? twice , her age, how ? old will her brother be in 3 years?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution:

**1. Determine the brother's age.**

* Ann's brother's age is twice Ann's age, so we can write an equation. 
*  Brother's age = 2 * Ann's age
*  Brother's age = 2 * 9 years
*  Brother's age = 18 years

**2. Calculate the brother's age in 3 years.**

* To find the brother's age in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age.
* Brother's age after 3 years = 18 years + 3 years
* Brother's age after 3 years = 21 years

**The final answer is 21 years old** 




<end_of_turn><eos>","Ann's brother is 9 * 2 = <<9*2=18>>18 years old now.
This means, in 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = <<18+3=21>>21 years old.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:** 
    * A quarter is worth 25 cents.
    * Kelly has 5 quarters, so they are worth 5 * 25 = 125 cents.

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
    * A dime is worth 10 cents.
    * Kelly has 2 dimes, so they are worth 2 * 10 = 20 cents.

3. **Calculate the total value of Kelly's money:**
    *  The total value is 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents

4. **Calculate how much the can of pop costs:**
     * The can costs 55 cents.

5. **Find the amount of money left:**
     *  Kelly has 145 cents and the can costs 55 cents.
      * 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents


{The final answer is 90 cents} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1. Identify the arrangement of stars:**

   We're given information about the arrangement of stars in three rows of 8, two rows of 6, and the rest are 5-star rows.

**2.  Calculate the total number of stars in each arrangement:**

   *   3 rows of 8 stars: 3 * 8 = 24 stars
   *   2 rows of 6 stars: 2 * 6 = 12 stars 
 
**3. Determine the remaining stars:**

   We have total stars = 24 + 12  = 36.
   
**4. Find the number of 5-star rows:**

   This implies that there are 36-24-12=0 rows of 5 stars.



**The Final Answer is:** 0 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.
The rows of 6 stars have a total of: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = <<2*6=12>>12 stars.
Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the knowns:**
    * Weight of one flagstone: 75 pounds
    * Total weight of 80 flagstones: 80 * 75 = 6000 pounds
    * Capacity of each truck: 2000 pounds

2. **Determine the number of trips needed:**  We need to divide the total weight by the capacity of each truck.  

3. **Calculate the number of trips:** 
   *  6000 pounds / 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trips


4. **Answer the question:**
   * The final answer is: **3 trucks**

It seems like your prompt has a few typos and some unclear wording, but I can help you break it down step by step!

**Understanding the Problem**

We're dealing with distances and speeds. Here's a breakdown:

* **Fast lane:** Car is traveling at 60 mph.
* **Slow lane:** Car is traveling half the speed of the fast lane, meaning 60 mph / 2 = 30 mph.
* **Distance:**  The fast lane car traveled 480 miles.
* **Question:**  We want to find the time the slow lane car took to travel the same distance.


**Step 1:  Define Variables**

* Let 't' represent the time it took for the slow lane car to travel 480 miles.


**Step 2: Utilize the Formula for Distance**

The distance formula tells us:

Distance = Speed × Time

**Step 3:  Apply the Formula to the Fast Lane**

We know:  
* Distance = 480 miles
* Speed = 60 mph

So, 480 = 60 × t

**Step 4: Solve for Time in the Fast Lane**

 * t = 480 / 60 
 * t = 8 hours


**Step 5: Find the Time in the Slow Lane**  
Since the slow lane car travels at 30 mph, and we know it traveled the same distance (480 miles) as the fast lane car, we can utilize the formula for distance:

 * 480 = 30 × t


**Step 6: Solve for Time in the Slow Lane**


* t = 480 / 30
* t = 16 hours

 



{The final answer is 16 hours.}<end_of_turn><eos>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.
To travel 480 miles, the car in the slow lane traveling at 30 miles per hour will take 480/30 = <<480/30=16>>16 hours

* **Step 4:** Solve for the total number of medals given out. 
 
Let's break down the problem step by step.


**Step 1: What information do we know?**

* Ali is a superstar counter and has won 22 medals.
* Izzy is also a good counter and has 5 less medals than Ali. 
* Together, they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting.


**Step 2: How can we represent this information using algebra?**

Let's use variables:

* Let  *x* represent the total number of medals given out for counting.
*  *y*  represent the number of medals Ali has won. 
*  *z* represent the number of medals Izzy has won.


We can write the information from the problem as an equation:

*y + z = x

**Step 3: Find an equation.**


We have two facts about Ali and Izzy:
* Ali has 22 medals, which is *y*
* Izzy has 5 less than Ali, or *z* = *y* - 5

**Step 4: Solve for the total number of medals given out.**

* **Combine all the facts:** *y + (y - 5) =  x*
* **Simplification:** *2y - 5 = x*


  The final answer is 2{ The final answer is 2y - 5 }** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Izzy has 22-5=<<22-5=17>>17 medal
Medals of Ali and Izzy 22+17=<<22+17=39>>39 medals

Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars:**

*  Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
*  They have 8 packets of chocolate.
*  Total chocolate bars = 5 chocolate bars/packet * 8 packets = 40 chocolate bars

**2. Determine the number of adult chocolate bars:**

*  Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
*  They have 4 adults.
*  Total adult chocolate bars = 6 chocolate bars/adult * 4 adults = 24 chocolate bars

**3. Calculate the number of chocolate bars for the children:** 

*  Total chocolate bars - Total adult chocolate bars = Chocolate bars for the children. 
*  Chocolate bars for children = 40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

**4. Find the number of chocolate bars per child:**

*  Each child gets 1/8 the rest of the chocolate bars.
*  The rest of the chocolate bars are shared equally by the kids
*  Chocolate bars per child = 16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

 {The final answer is 2 chocolate bars per child.}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

t 
 


Here's how we can break down the solution:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

* Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes.
* She works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. (This is her working time).
*  She takes a break of half an hour (30 minutes) in between. 

**2.  Determining Total Work Time:**

* Working time: 11 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 3 hours 
* We need to be sure that the work time only includes the time within the given hours, not a longer period.


*3. Convert hours to minutes: *

8:00 a.m to 11:00 a.m = 3 hours * 60 minutes per hour

* Total work minutes: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes


 

**4. Determining Work Intervals:**

 
* We need to figure out how many 10-minute intervals she works during her work time.
* The number of 10-minute intervals she works is: 180 minutes / 10 minutes/interval. 
 *  = 18 intervals 

**5. Calculating Total Earnings:**

We find the total earnings for each interval. 
* Total earnings are: 18 intervals * $5/interval

= $90


**The final answer is:** $90. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.
So she works 2.5 * 60 = <<2.5*60=150>>150 minutes
She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

*   Mike: 21 points
*   Jim: 21 - 3 = 18 points
*   Tony: 21 * 2 = 42 points

**2.  Extra Points in the Fourth Round:**

*   We need to consider the additional points for each player. 


**3.  Determining the Extra Points:**

*   We know each player gets 1 extra point if they have over 20 points.



**4.  Final Round Scores:**


 
**5.  Total Point Calculation:**

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the youngest son's age:**

* The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, who is 8 years old.
* Youngest son's age = 8 / 2 = 4 years old.

**2. Determine the number of oranges the oldest son can wash:**

* The oldest son is 8 years old and needs to wash the oranges.
 

**3. Determine the number of oranges the youngest son can wash:**

* The youngest son is 4 years old and needs to wash the oranges. 


**4. Determine the total number of oranges that can be washed:**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total rice consumption per day.**

* Each person consumes 0.2 kg per meal * 2 meals = 0.4 kg of rice per day.
* Total daily consumption: 0.4 kg/person/day * 5 people = 2 kg of rice per day.
 
**2. Calculate the total rice consumption for a week.**

* Weekly consumption: 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg of rice per week.

**3. Determine the number of weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last.**

* Number of weeks: 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.


{The final answer is 3 weeks} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

Carmen bids . after each ? of the 3 other ; people and eventually ; wins. How , much ; money, in dollars, does . the ? desk cost . her?<end_of_turn>


**Here's a step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   * Carmen wants to win an antique desk at auction.
   * She starts at $200 and keeps bidding in steps of $50. 
   * Three other people also participate.
   * Carmen responds to each bid made by the others.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   * Let `x` represent the number of times Carmen makes a bid.


3. **Understanding the Bidding Process:**
   * Each bid starts at $200 and then increases by $50.
   * Each bid goes to whoever wins the bidding.

4. **Finding the Final Cost:**
   * We figure out how much Carmen spends at each stage.
   * Then, we add those amounts up to see how much it costs to Carmen overall.
  
     
5. **Detailed Calculations:**


It's difficult to calculate the exact amount Carmen pays without a full breakdown of her bidding strategy.


**Note:** This problem requires a lot of detail to determine the final auction price. 

Let me know if you'd like to try working the problem through specific rounds of bidding! 


<end_of_turn><eos>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

*Note:  round the cost to the nearest dollar

**Solution**
1. **Calculate total miles driven per week:**
    - He goes 30 miles to work, and 30 miles back, for a total of 60 miles per day. 
    - Total miles per week: 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week
2. **Calculate total miles driven per year:**
    - Total miles per year: 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles/year
3. **Calculate total cost per year:**
    - Cost per mile: $2
    - Total cost: 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000 

4. **Add the driver bonus:**
    - Total cost per year: $30,000 + $150/month * 12 months/year = $30,000 + $1800 = $31,800

**Reasoning**

* We broke down the problem into smaller steps to isolate each factor.
* Each step uses arithmetic and the problem specifications.

<end_of_turn><eos>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year

On , Monday he ; exercised for 16 minutes. How many : minutes does he have to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the total time Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday.**

*  Sunday's time: 23 minutes
*  Monday's time: 16 minutes
*  Total time: 23 + 16 = 39 minutes

**2. Determine how much longer Peter will exercise on Tuesday.**

*  Time on Tuesday = Twice the time on Sunday & Monday

There . are ; currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Find the number of books sold in the first year**

* Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year.
* So, she sold 45 books * 2 = 90 books in the first year.

**Step 2: Calculate total sales in the first year**

*  She sold 90 books at $20 each.
*  Total earnings in the first year: 90 * 20 = $1,800

**Step 3: Find the number of books sold in the first two years**

*  She sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the current year.
*  Total books sold = 90 + 45 = 135 books


**Step 4: Calculates total earnings across two years**
* She earned $1,800 in the first year and 
* Total earnings: $1800

**{The final answer is $1800}**



<end_of_turn><eos>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

* Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week.
* He earns $10 per hour.
* He gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well.
* The company performs well for the whole month of April.


**Question:** How much money did Watson make in April?


Here's how to break down the calculation:

1. **Calculate Watson's weekly earnings:**
    * He earns $10 per hour and works 10 hours a day, 5 days a week.
    * Weekly earnings = $10/hour * 10 hours/day * 5 days/week = $500/week

2. **Calculate Watson's bonus:**
    * He receives a $300 bonus per week.

3. **Calculate Watson's total earnings for April:**
    * Total earnings = Weekly earnings + Bonus.
    * Total earnings = $500/week * 4 weeks = $2000

 


{The final answer is $2000} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.

## Solution:

**Step 1:  Understand the Problem**
* We are given that John wrestles 20 people and he beats 80% of them.
* We want to find out how many people he lost to.

**Step 2:  Use Percentage to Find the Number of People John Loses**
*  80% of the people means that 80 out of every 100.  
*  This means that John wins 80 out of every 100.

**Step 3:  Calculate the Number of People John Loses**

* To find the number that John loses  to, there's a bit of reverse math because we want to find the number of people lost.
* The number of people that John loses to is calculated as 20 people - the number of people that John wins. 
* The number of people that John wins is calculated as 20 people * 0.80.


 
**Final Answer is:** {John lost to 4 people}

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**Step 1:  Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.**

* Multiply the daily production by the proportion sold in the morning:  60 loaves * (2/3) = 40 loaves

**Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sale.**

* Subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total production: 60 loaves - 40 loaves = 20 loaves

**Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.**

*  Divide the loaves left by two to find half the leftover loaves: 20 loaves / 2 = 10 loaves

 
**Step 4: Determine the total loaves sold in the afternoon.**

*  Multiply the loaves sold in the afternoon by 2 to find the total of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening: 10 loaves * 2 = 20 loaves




**The final answer is: 20 loaves**

Here's how to solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Find out how much Joey loses per week.**

* Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
* To find out how much he loses per week, divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks: 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week.

**Step 2: Determine how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.**

*  Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight Joey loses in one week.
*  Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week,  Sandy will need the same amount of time to lose the same amount of weight.


**Step 3: Answer the question:**

*  Sandy will need **4 weeks** to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.  
{The final answer is 4 weeks}

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the cost of the suits:**

* Cost of 6 business suits = 6 * $100 = $600

**2. Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**

* Cost of 3 suitcases = 3 * $50 = $150

**3. Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**

* 5 times the cost of a suit = 5 * $100 = $500
* Cost of the flight ticket = $700 more than 5 times the suit cost
* Cost of the flight ticket = $500 + $700 = $1200

**4. Calculate the total cost of the trip:**

* Total cost = Cost of suits + cost of suitcases + cost of flight ticket
* Total cost = $600 + $150 + $1200 = $2950

**5. Calculate the amount Theo has left:**

* Amount left = Total funds - total trip cost
* Amount left = $6000 - $2950 = $3050

**6. Determine the remaining money for gifts:**

* Amount for gifts = Amount left after trip
* Amount for gifts = $3050

So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.
Thus, 2 x 2 = 4 eggs are consumed by the two other people in a day.
So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

*This question requires a multi-step problem solving process. 


**Here's a step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let ""Q"" represent the age of Quinn.
   * Let ""J"" represent the age of Jane.
   * Let ""T"" represent the age of Trent.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   * **Equation 1:**  T = J + 5  (Trent is 5 years older than Jane)
   * **Equation 2:** J = Q - 3   (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn)
   * **Equation 3:** Q = 30   (Quinn is 30 years old)

3. **Solve for the Age of Jane (J):**
   * Substitute the value of Q from Equation 3 into Equation 2:  J = 30 - 3 
   * Therefore: J = 27


4. **Solve for the Age of Trent (T):**
   * Substitute the value of J from step 3 into Equation 1: T = 27 + 5
   * Therefore: T = 32


**The final answer is:** Trent is 32 years old.

If the ! population of ; Chile : six ? years ? ago was 3000 times : the age of , Noah, calculate ? the population of Chile , now.<end_of_turn>


Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 

**1.  Define Variables:**

*  Let  'n' represent Noah's age six years ago.
*  Let 'c' represent Cera's age six years ago.

**2. Set up Equations:**

*  We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera:  n = (c/2)
*  We also know the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age six years ago: Population (6 years ago) = 3000 * n 
*  We know Cera's current age: c = 46
*  We know Cera's age six years ago: c - 6 

**3. Solve for Noah's Age Six Years Ago (n):**

*  We can use the first equation to solve for n: n = (c/2)  
*  Substitute c = 46 into the equation: n = (46/2) = 23 
 

**4. Calculate Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**

*  We can use the second equation with n = 23: Population (6 years ago) = 3000 * 23 = 70,000 

**5. Calculate the Current Population of Chile:**

*  We can use the relationship between present population and past population since the population was half of its current value six years ago.
*   Population now = 2 * Population 6 years ago 
*   Population now = 2 * 70,000 = 140,000


 {The final answer is 140,000}   




<end_of_turn><eos>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
    * Volume = Length x Width x Depth
    * Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 5 feet
    * Volume = 120 cubic feet

**2. Determine the Cost:**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Given Information**

* **""If ?a : classroom ? has 3 times as ! many girls ; as ; they ? do boys""**:  This tells us the ratio between girls and boys is 3:1. 
* **""and 1/10 as ! many ? nongendered : children , as they do boys""**:  This means the ratio of nongendered children to boys is 1/10.
* **""and the classroom : has ! 30 boys.""**:  We know there are 30 boys in the classroom.


**2. Set Up Variables and Formulas**

We need a variable to represent the number of girls. We can call this 'g'. 

We need another variable to represent the number of boys.  We can call this 'b'.


**3. Express Relationships using Ratios**

* **Girls to Boys**:  The ratio of girls to boys is 3:1, so: g = 3b. 
* **Nongendered to Boys**: The ratio of nongendered to boys is 1/10, so: non_gendered = (1/10) * b


**4. Solve for Variables**

We know there are 30 boys in the classroom.  : 
b = 30


Now that we know the number of boys, we can use the ratio of girls to boys to find the number of girls and then we will find the number of non-gendered children. 

**5. Calculate Total Children**

 Finally, we can add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom: 
Total children: b + g + non_gendered 

{The final answer is 30 + 3b + (1/10)b}




<end_of_turn><eos>","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.

Electric poles and electric wires work together to distribute electricity. 

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

*  Let  *""x""* represent the number of electric poles.
*  Let  *""3x""* represent the number of electric wires.


**Step 2: Set up the Equation**

We are given that the ratio of poles to wires is 1:3. This means:
  * x = 3x

**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Electric Poles**

We want to find the total number of electric poles (x). We can do this by rearranging the equation we created in step 2. 
* Subtract 3x from both sides of the equation. 
*  x - 3x = 0 
* -2x = 0 
* x = 0. 

*This is a contradiction meaning something is wrong. 
 


**Conclusion:** Given the relationship between electric poles and wires and the given number of wires, 
{ The final answer is incorrect.}

<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the total number of people initially at the party:**

* Total initial people = 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

**2. Calculate the number of people who left:**

* Number leaving = (1/4) * 40 people = 10 people 

**3. Calculate the number of people remaining:**

* Number remaining = Total initial people - Number leaving 
* Number remaining = 40 people - 10 people = 30 people

**4. Calculate the number of women remaining:**

* Number of women remaining = Number remaining people - Number leaving people * 
* Number of women remaining = 30 people - (10 people) * = 20 women


{The final answer is 20 women} 
 

<end_of_turn><eos>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.

**Detailed Analysis**

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let `J` represent the number of Junior programmers.
   * Let `S` represent the number of Senior programmers. 

2. **Set Up Equations based on Given Information:**
   * We know that Junior programmers are 2/5 of the total employees. This means:
      * `J = (2/5) * 100` 
      * Simplifying: `J = 40` 
   * We know that Senior programmers earn $400 more than Junior programmers, so: 
      * `S = J + $400`
   * We know that each Junior programmer earns $2000 per month.

3. **Calculate the Number of Senior Programmers:**
   * Substitute the value of Junior programmers into the equation:
      * `S = 40 + $400`
      * `S = 440`

4. **Calculate the Total Monthly Salary for All Programmers:**
   *  Now we know:
      * `J = 40`
      * `S = 440`

    * Total Salary = (Salary of Junior Programmers) + (Salary of Senior Programmers)
    * Total Salary = `(40 * $2000) + (440 * $4000)`



**Final Answer:** {The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $1280,000}

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let 'x' be the number of people who got on the bus at the first bus stop. 
2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   * The total number of people on the bus after the first bus stop is x + 5 
   * The total people after the second bus stop is (x + 5) + 7 + 8. 
   * We know the total number of people is 20. The total number of people is x+5+7+8=x+20
3. **Solve for x:**
   *  20 = x + 20 {This equation balances the total number of people on the bus at the third stop}
   *  Therefore, x = 0  



**Final Answer: {There were 0 people who got on the bus at the terminal.}**

Solution:
Step 1: Figure out how many lollipops he gives away.
   * Start with his original amount: 24 lollipops
   * Subtract the lollipops he gives away: 24 - 14 = 10 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops he buys on the home leg.
   * He buys twice as many as he gives away: 10 * 2 = 20 lollipops.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of lollipops he has after buying on the way home.
   *  Total lollipops: 24 + 10 + 20 = 54 lollipops.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of lollipops he eats.
   *  He eats 3 more at night and adds 2 more in the morning. : 54 + 3 + 2 = 59 lollipops.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Understand the Rate**

* The phone recharges at 1% of charge per 3 minutes.  This means each 3-minute interval represents a tiny percentage of the full charge.

**2. Calculate the Time to Reach 100%**

* We want to figure out how long it takes to reach 100% charge.
* Let's represent the number of minutes (t) to fully charge: 
   *  A percentage of the total charge represents 100%, meaning it's represented as a fraction (e.g., 60% as 60/100).


**3.  Identify the Relationship** 

* We can express the percentage as a fraction, e.g., 60% is represented as 60/100.


**4. Final Answer** 
{The final answer is 

}


<end_of_turn><eos>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.
And 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 hours.

Here's how we can step through the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the Earnings at Job A**

* Hourly rate: $15
* Hours per year: 2000 
* Annual Earnings: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Tax at Job A**

* Total Tax Rate: 20%
* Annual Salary: $30,000 
* Total Tax at Job A: 0.20 * $30,000 = $6,000

**Step 3: Calculate the Net Earnings at Job A**

* Net Earnings:  $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Step 4: Calculate the Total Tax at Job B**

* Total Tax Rate: 10%
* Annual Salary after Property Tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* Total Tax at Job B: 0.10 * $36,000 = $3,600

**Step 5: Calculate the Net Earnings at Job B**

* Net Earnings: $42,000 - $3,600 = $38,400

**Step 6: Calculate the Difference in Net Earnings**

* Net Earnings at Job B- Net Earnings at Job A: $38,400 - $24,000 = $14,400

{The final answer is $14,400} . 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000
Next, calculate the amount of taxes Nick pays at Job A by multiplying his net salary by the 20% tax rate: .2 * $30,000 = $<<30000*.2=6000>>6,000
Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400
Now subtract the net income from the lower-paying job (A) from the net income from the higher-paying job (B): $32,400 - $24,000 = $<<32400-24000=8400>>8,400

Here's how we can break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of Furniture United's offer:**

*   **Advance payment:** $1,350
*   **Monthly installments:** 6 installments * $350/installment = $2,100

**2. Calculate the total cost of Furniture United's offer:**

Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step: 

**Step 1: Calculate the first-year gain.**

* Price per share: $8
* Increase: 50% of $8 = (50/100) * $8 = $4 
* New price per share: $8 + $4 = $12

**Step 2: Calculate the total value of Maria's shares after the first year.**

* Total shares: 8
* Price per share: $12
* Total value after year 1: 8 shares * $12/share = $96
 
    

**Step 3 : Calculate the second-year decrease.**

* Price per share: $12
* Decrease: 25% of $12 = (25/100) * $12 = $3 
* New price per share: $12 - $3 = $9

**Step 4: Calculate the total value of Maria's shares after the second year.**

* Total shares: 8
* New price per share: $9
* Total value after year 2: 8 shares * $9/share = $72

 


**Step 5: Calculate the final value of all Maria's shares.**

* Total value after year 2: $72
* This is Maria's final value. 
 


{The final answer is $72}

Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We have a class with 200 students.
* The class is divided into three groups. 
* Two groups have the same number of students.
* The third group is 10 less than each of the other two.

**2.  Define Variables:**

* Let  `x` represent the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
 
**3. Set Up Equations:** 

* Since the second group has the same number of students as the first, we can write the equation: `x = 
number of students in the first group`.
* The third group has 10 less than the first, so the equation is: `x + 10`.
* We can set up an equation to show that these numbers equal to 200.


 
**4. Solve the Equations:**
 

* We have the following unknowns:  `x` 


**5. Final Answer:**


* {The final answer is

**3. Solve for the Number of Chickens (c) and Cows (v):** 

*  We now have two equations with two unknowns:
    *  c = 2v 
    *  c + v = 60
*  Solve the first equation for 'c': 
    *  c = 2v 
*  Substitute the value of 'c' into the second equation:
    * 2v+v = 60
    * 3v = 60
    *  v = 20 
*  Substitute the value of 'v' into the equation for 'c':
    *  c = 2 * 20
    *  c = 40

**4. Calculate the Total Number of Legs:**

* One chicken has 2 legs, and one cow has 4 legs.  
* Total legs = 2 * c + 4 * v
* Total legs = 2 * 40 + 4 * 20 
* Total legs = 80 + 80
* Total legs = 160


 


**Final Answer: {The final answer is 160}**<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.
There are 60-40=<<60-40=20>>20 cows.
The chickens have 40*2=<<40*2=80>>80 legs.
The cows have 20*4=<<20*4=80>>80 legs.
They have 80+80=<<80+80=160>>160 legs altogether.

Let's break this problem down step by step:

**1. Initial Setup:**

* Josh starts juggling 3 balls.

**2.  Weekly Improvement:**

* He adds 1 ball each week.
* This means his juggling routine adds a new ball each week.

**3.  Calculating the Number of Balls After 4 Weeks:**

* Week 1: 3 balls
* Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
* Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
* Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls 

**4.  The Talent Show:**

* Josh drops 3 balls:  6 - 3 = 3 balls
* 2 of the dropped balls are caught: 3 - 2 = 1 ball
* Josh has 1 ball left to juggle. 


{The final answer is 1 ball } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7

If ? the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, . calculate the ? total weight of a container carrying one of each animal . if the container also weighs 20 ! pounds.<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1. Define Variables**

*  Let 'F' represent the weight of the pink frog.
*  Let 'B' represent the weight of the blue beetle.
*  Let 'G' represent the weight of the green toad.
*  Let 'Y' represent the weight of the yellow snake.
*  Let 'R' represent the weight of the red bird.
*  Let 'C' represent the weight of the container.

**2. Create Equations Based on the Information Given**

* We are given that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:  F = B
* We are told the pink frog weighs 50 pounds: F = 50
* The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog: G = F 
* The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds less than the pink frog: Y = F - 10
* The Yellow snake weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird: Y = R + 20
* The container weighs 20 pounds more than the pink frog: C = F + 20


**3. Solve for the Animal's Weights**

* Since F = 50, we can plug it into each equation.

* F = B 
    * 50 = B
* F = G
    * 50 = G
* F = Y - 10
    * 50 = Y -10
    * 60 = Y
* F = Y + 20
    * 50 = Y + 20
    * 30 = Y

*  We know the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, and green toad are 50, 50, and 50 respectively.

**4. Calculate the Total Weight**

 * The total weight in the container is: 
 	C = F + B + G + Y + R 
 *  C = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
 	C = 280

 {The final answer is 280 pounds}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

*Solution:* 

1. **Identify the starting information:**
   * Laurel received 24 baby outfits as a gift.
   * At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of baby outfits she received from her friend. 
   * Laurel's mom gifted her another 15 baby outfits.

2. **Set up a variable for the unknown quantity:**
   Let 'x' represent the number of outfits Laurel received at her shower. 

3. **Express the information in the problem algebraically:**  
   * We know Laurel received twice the number of outfits her friend gave her, which translates to: 2x = 24
   
4. **Solve for the number of outfits Laurel received at her shower (x):**
   * Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 12

5. **Add up all the outfits:**
   * Total outfits: 24 + 12 + 15 = 51

6. **The final answer is:**   51 outfits

If ! he ! took : the ; coach's advice and trained for ; a month, ? what , is the total : distance he covered in June?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the increased distance:**

* The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more than his usual distance. 
* This means the increased distance is (1/5) * 5000 meters = 1000 meters.

**2. Calculate the new total distance:**

*  Tyson's new daily distance is his usual distance plus the increased distance. 
*  His new daily distance is 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

**3. Determine the total distance for a month:** 
* Tyson runs 6000 meters per day for a month which means the total distance is 6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters.


**The final answer is 180,000 meters** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.
When he took the coach's advice, he increased the training distance he runs per day to 5000 meters + 1000 meters = <<5000+1000=6000>>6000 meters.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Cookies in the son's lunchbox:**

* Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunchbox per day. 
*  She does this 5 days a week.
*  Therefore, she puts 4 cookies/day * 5 days/week = 20 cookies in the son's lunchbox per week.

**2. Husband's cookie consumption:**

* Her husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days.
*  He eats 1 cookie/day * 7 days = 7 cookies.

**3. Total cookies from all sources:**

*  Jenny puts 20 cookies in her son's lunch box per week.
*  Her husband eats 7 cookies per week.
*  Jenny eats the rest of the cookies. 

**4. Calculating the number of cookies Jenny eats:**

*Please remember that the problem requires you to show your work and explain your reasoning.*

Here's how we can break this problem down:

**1. Set up the variables:**

* Let 's' represent the amount of money Andrea saved.
* We know Andrea had $36 at the beginning, and spent some on a sweater and a gift.
* The rest was left after spending.
 

**2. Formulate the equations:**
* We know her final amount was $36 - $11 - $4 = $21
* The amount Andrea had left = $21

**3.  Understand the relationship:**

* We need to identify how much Andrea saved. 
* Andrea had $36 at the start, but spent some for a sweater and a gift.

**4. Solve for the amount saved:**


* We know Andrea began with $36 and had $21 left, so the amount saved is  $36 - $21.
* Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is $15. {The final answer is $15}

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.
So, she saved $36 - $15 = $<<36-15=21>>21.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and how to solve it:

**1. Calculate swimming time:**

* John spends 6 hours boating, and half that time swimming.
* Swimming time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

**2. Calculate total time spent watching shows:**

* Each show was 2 hours.
* Total show time = 3 shows * 2 hours/show = 6 hours.

**3. Calculate the proportion of time spent watching shows:**

* Shows took up 6 hours * 30% = 1.8 hours

**4. Calculate the total time spent on all activities:**

* Time spent on boating + time spent swimming + time spent watching shows  + time spent sightseeing = Total time

**5. Calculate the time spent on sightseeing:**

* We know he spent 6 hours boating, 3 hours swimming, and 1.8 hours watching shows
* Total time is 6 + 3 + 1.8 = 10.8 hours
* Time spent sightseeing = 10.8 hours * 40% = 4.32 hours 

{The final answer is 4.32 hours}





<end_of_turn><eos>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows
So he spent 6+3+6=<<6+3+6=15>>15 hours on these activities
That means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities
So he spent 50*.4=<<50*.4=20>>20 hours sightseeing

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate Annabelle's earnings from her first job:**
* Hourly rate: $10
* Hours worked: 20
* Earnings: $10 * 20 = $200

**2. Calculate Annabelle's earnings from her second job:**
* Hourly rate: $5
* Hours worked: 15

**4. Calculate the remaining amount Annabelle needs to save:**
* Total needed: $400
* Savings: $80 
* Remaining amount: $400 - $80 = $320


**The final answer is: Annabelle still needs to save $320.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Define Variables**
* Let  ’s represent the height of the shortest tree. 
* Let 't' represent the height of the second tree.
* Let ‘t2’ represent the height of the tallest tree.


**2. Set up Equations Based on the Given Information**

* We are told the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. So, s = 6 
* The second tree is 5 feet higher than the shortest tree, so t = s + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 feet. 
* The tallest tree is twice the height of the two combined, so t2 = 2(s+t) = 2(6 + 11 ) = 2(17) = 34 feet. 




**3. Answer**

The tallest tree is {34 feet} high.<end_of_turn><eos>","The height of the second tree is 6 + 5 = <<6+5=11>>11 feet.
Thus, the combined height of the two trees is 6 + 11 = <<6+11=17>>17 feet.
Therefore the height of the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = <<2*17=34>>34 feet.

*Remember to be careful with your arithmetic and show your working.*

**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the toy cars:** 
   * 6 toy cars * $2/car = $12
2. **Calculate the cost of the teddy bears:**
   * 5 teddy bears * $1/bear = $5
3. **Calculate the total cost of his purchases:** 
   * $12 (toy cars) + $5 (teddy bears) = $17
4. **Calculate the amount of money Dean had after buying his purchases:**
    * $28 (starting amount) - $17 (total cost) = $11  
5. **Calculate the amount of money the mother added:**
   * $10 (extra)
6. **Calculate the final amount of money Dean has:**
   * $11 (original amount) + $10 (extra) = $21

 **The final answer is:** $21 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears × $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.
Adding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.
Dean has $38 − $17 = $21 left.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Cost of the lollipops:**

* Marisa buys 4 lollipops * $0.25/lollipop = $1

**2. Total daily savings:**

* Marisa gets $5 and spends $1.
* Her daily savings are $5 - $1 = $4

**3. Total savings for 5 days:**

* Marisa saves $4/day * 5 days = $20


**4. Result**

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1.  Calculate the change Billy received:**

*   Start with the amount Billy had: $10.00
*   Subtract the cost of the candy: $10.00 - $1.50/pound * number of pounds = change

**2. Calculate the amount of change Billy spends on gumballs:**

*   The cost of gumballs is $0.05 per gumball 
*   He bought 40 gumballs at $0.05/gumball: $0.05/gumball * 40 gumballs = $2.00

**3.  Calculate the remaining amount of the change:**

*   Subtract the gumball price from his original change: $10.00 - $2.00 = $8.00
 
**4.  Determine the number of pounds of candy:**

*   Divide the remaining amount by the cost of one pound of candy: $8.00 / $1.50/pound = 5.33 pounds.


**Final answer: Billy bought 5.33 pounds of candy.**


 

<end_of_turn><eos>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2
He had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4

Here's how to break down the problem and solve it:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

* We're given that Carver is 45 years old.
* We need to find the age of his son.
* The key to this problem is the relationship between Carver's age and his son's age.

**2. Setting up Variables:**

* Let 's' represent the age of Carver's son. 

**3. Formulating an Equation:**

* The problem tells us that Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age. We can write this as an equation: 
   Carver's age = Twice the age of his son - 5 

* Let's substitute Carver's age with the known value of 45:
   45 = 2s - 5

**4. Solving for 's':**

*  Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   50 = 2s

*  Divide both sides by 2 :
    25 = s

 


**5. Final Answer:**

{The final answer is 25}  

<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

* {The final answer is.}



##  Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the distances:**
    - Distance between city 1 and city 2: 75 miles
    - Distance between city 2 and city 3: 100 miles
    - Distance between city 3 and city 1: 50 miles less than 100+75 (combined distance), so it's 100-50 = 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled per trip:**
    -  Total distance traveled per trip: 75 + 100 + 50 = 225 miles 

3. **Determine the total distance traveled per day:**
    - Since the trip happens 3 times a day, the total distance traveled daily is 225 miles/trip * 3 trips/day = 675 miles 

4. **Find the service intervals:**
    - The train needs service every 18,000 miles
   

 5. **Determine the number of days between services:**
    -  Number of days between services = 18,000 miles / 675 miles = 27 days


{The final answer is 27 days } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

**Solution**

1. **Define Variables:** 
   * Let 't' represent the time in hours taken for the entire journey. 

2. **Calculate Time for the Original Trip:**
   *  Formula: Distance = Speed * Time
   *  We can first find the time taken for the original 200-mile distance.
   *  Time = Distance / Speed 
   *  Time = 200 miles / 70 mph = 2.86 hours

3. **Calculate Time for the Detour:**
   * The detour adds 10 miles to the original trip, so the new total distance is 200 + 10 = 210 miles
    * Time = Distance / Speed
    * Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

4. **Calculate Time for the Return Trip:** 
   * Formula: Distance = Speed * Time
   * Time = Distance / Speed
   * Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

5. **Calculate Combined Time:**
   * Since the detour and return takes 3 hours + 2.86 hours = 5.86 hours.


 {The final answer is 5.86 hours} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles
So he drove 210/70=<<210/70=3>>3 hours

* Since there are twice the number of boys as girls, the number of boys is 2 times the number of girls. So: b = 2 * 6.
* Therefore: b = 12

**4. Find the total number of kids:**

* Calculate the total number of kids by adding the number of girls and the number of boys: 6 + 12 = 18


**5. Express the answer:**
*  The final answer is 18 kids are in the park.

If a . total ? of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other ; reasons?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We are given information about the reasons why different groups of people were kicked out of a Walmart.
* We have to find out how many people were kicked out for ""other reasons.""


**2. Translate the Phrases:**

* **""3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.""** This means there were 3 times the number of people kicked out for refusal to wear masks. 
* **""A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.""**  This means there are four times the number of shoplifters minus 5 kicked out from shoplifting.
* **""Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.""** This means three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for violence.
* **""If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart""** This means we need to combine all the reasons to find the number of groups kicked out for other reasons.

**3. Create Equations:**

* Let ""x"" equal the total number of customers kicked out for refusing masks.
* The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is represented as ""4x - 5"", 
* The number of customers kicked out for violence is represented as 3 * (4x - 5)


**4. Set up the Equation:**

* The total number of people kicked out is the sum of all reasons:  x + (4x - 5) + 3*(4x - 5) = 50

 **5.Solve for x:**


* Simplify: x + 4x - 5 + 12x -15 = 50
* Combine like terms: 17x - 20 = 50
* Add 20 to both sides: 17x = 70
* Divide both sides by 17: x = 4.12


**6. Find the number of people kicked out for other reasons:**


* Combine the total number of people kicked out for all reasons.



**Final Answer:** {The final answer is 4.12} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

*Step 1*: Define Variables
*Step 2*: State the Given Data
*Step 3*: Formulate the Problem
*Step 4*: Solve for the Unknown
*Step 5*: Check Your Answer


Let’s break down the problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**
* Let 'x' represent the number of functioning pieces of equipment.
*  Let 'y' represent the number of faulty pieces of equipment.

**Step 2: State the Given Data**
* The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
* 40% of the equipment is faulty, meaning y = 0.4x 


**Step 3: Formulate the Problem** 
The company bought equipment for $400,000, and 40% of that equipment was faulty. They returned the faulty equipment. This means they are left with the functioning equipment. So we need to find the total cost of the functioning equipment.



**Step 4: Solve for the Unknown**
  * The number of functioning pieces is: x = 400,000 / (1 - 0.4) 
  * To get x can be found by solving the equation above


**Step 5: Check Your Answer** 





<end_of_turn><eos>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the starting number:** The problem tells us there are 40 pupils in the class.

2. **Find the number who like blue:**  Half of the class likes blue, so half of 40 pupils are like blue. 
    40 / 2 = 20 pupils like blue.

3. **Find the number remaining:** After pupils like blue, there are 40 - 20 pupils remaining.

4. **Find the number who like green:**  One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. 
    40 / 4 = 10 pupils like green.

5. **Find the number who like yellow:**  Subtract the number who like blue and green from the total, who remain to find the number liking yellow.

Here's how we can break down the solution:

**1. Apples Sold on Monday:**

   * Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56.
   * Since each apple is $4, she sold 56 / 4 = 14 apples on Monday.

**2. Apples Picked on Tuesday:**

   * Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

**3. Apples Picked on Wednesday:**

   * Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, meaning she picked 12 x 2 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Lindsay is doing the laundry.
   - She thinks she might have missed some socks. 
   - There are 50 socks that need to be washed.
   - She washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the monthly interest:**

* Interest rate = 10%
* Principal amount = $3,650
* Monthly interest = (10/100) * $3,650 = $365

**2. Determine the total amount paid over five months:**

* Total borrowed = $3,650
* Monthly interest = $365
*  Total paid over five months = $365 * 5 = $1,825

**3. Determine the monthly payment.**

* Total amount paid over five months = $1,825
*  Amount paid per month = Total payment / Number of months
*  Amount paid per month = $1,825 / 5 = $365



**Therefore, Karan has to pay $365 per month.**
{The final answer is $365 per month.} 
 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

**1. Calculate Cho's total distance.**

* Distance = Speed * Time
* Distance = 14 km/hour * 8 hours
* Distance = 112 kilometers

**2.  Determine Chloe's distance.**

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out how many silver pesos Anna has.**

* Axel has 50 silver pesos.
* Anna has twice as many as Axel, so Anna has 50 * 2 = 100 silver pesos.

**2. Figure out how many gold pesos Anna has.**

* Axel has 80 gold pesos.
* Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.

**3. Calculate the total number of silver pesos they have.**

* Both Axel and Anna have 100 silver pesos.

**4. Calculate the total number of gold pesos they have.**

* Both Axel and Anna have 120 gold pesos.


**5. Calculate the total number of pesos.**

* Total pesos = silver pesos + gold pesos
* Total pesos = 100 + 120 = 220 pesos

*Note: Your answer should be in dollars.*


**Solution:**
1. **Calculate total cups of lemonade:**  
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - Millie has 3 pitchers.
   - Total cups: 12 cups/pitcher * 3 pitchers = 36 cups

2. **Calculate total earnings per hour:**

3. **Calculate profit per hour:**
   - Cost per hour of supplies: $18
   - Total earnings per hour: $4/hour
   - Profit per hour: $4/hour - $18/hour = -$14/hour
   


{The final answer is -$14/hour.}

                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. ? How ? much . land did he have at first?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**
  * We know Mr. Ruther sold some of his land, leaving 12.8 hectares. 
  * The key is to find the original size of his land.

**2. Set up a Proportional Relationship**
  * Assume the original land size is represented by 'x'.
  *  The proportion that represents the portion he sold is (3/5) of the land.
  * The remaining portion is represented by 12.8 hectares.

**3. Formulate an Equation:**
  * We can set up an equation based on this relationship. This equation is:  (3/5)x = 12.8 

**4. Solve for 'x':**
  *  To find 'x', follow these steps:
      * *Multiply both sides of the equation by 5/3:*
         (5/3) * (3/5)x = (5/3) * 12.8 
         x = 21.33 

**5. Final Answer:**
  * {The final answer is 21.33 hectares of land} 



Let me know if you'd like to see further clarification on any step or have another problem you'd like me to solve. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Ratio:**

* The ratio 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.
 
**2. Set up Equation:**

*  Let 'x' be the number of popsicles Betty has. 
*  Then, Sam has 6x popsicles. 
* We know their total popsicles are 165:  x + 6x = 165

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine the x's: 7x = 165
* Divide both sides by 7: x = 23.57 
 (We can approximate this as 24 popsicles)

**4. Calculate Sam's Popsicles:**

* Sam has 6x popsicles, which means Sam has 6 * 24 = 144 popsicles. 
 

**5. Find the Difference:**

*  Difference between Sam's and Betty's popsicles. Sam has 144 - 24 = 120 more popsicles than Betty.

Here's how we break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus individually:**

* Normally, Hulu costs: $10.00/month
* Normally, Disney Plus costs: $10.00/month

**2. Calculate the bundle discount:**

* He saves 20% off the combined price.
*  20% of ($10.00 + $10.00) = 0.20 * ($20.00) = $4.00


**3. Calculate the discounted price for Hulu and Disney Plus:**

* Hulu price after the discount: $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00/month
* Disney Plus price after the discount:  $10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00/month

**4. Calculate Tim's total cost for the streaming services:**

* He pays $10.00 for Netflix.
* He pays $6.00 for Hulu.
* He pays $6.00 for Disney Plus.

**5. Calculate the total savings by cancelling his cable package:**

* He would have paid $60.00 for cable.
* Total cost of streaming: $10.00 + $6.00 + $6.00 = $22.00

t 


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Calculate recording time:**

* Carol spends half the time writing, so she spends 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours recording.

**2. Convert recording time to minutes:**

* Convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

**3. Calculate the total work time:**

* Add up the writing, recording, and editing times: 4 hours + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 160 minutes. 
 


**4. Calculate the percentage of time spent editing:**

* Divide the time spent editing by the total work time and multiply by 100: (90 minutes / 160 minutes) * 100% = 56.25%


**5. Round to the nearest percent**
 
 The final answer is 56.25% 

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes
Then find how long she spent recording the song: 240 minutes / 2 = <<240/2=120>>120 minutes
Then add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 ​minutes
Then divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%

*Remember to include the appropriate mathematical symbols and equations.* 

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
    * Let 'x' represent the number of books Wendy needs to carry.

2. **Express the problem using an equation:** 
    *  ""20 more than double the number of books"" is written as  20 + 2 * x
    *  ""the number of books in a shelving system"" is represented by the product of 6 rows * 6 columns 
    * ""with 6 rows and 6 columns"" is represented by 6 * 6

3. **Set up the equation:** 
    * Our objective is to find the value of 'x', so we need to combine the concepts above into a single, consistent equation
    *  20 + 2 * x = 6 * 6

4. **Solve for 'x':**
    * Simplify the right side of the equation: 20 + 2 * x = 36
    * Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with 'x': 2 * x = 16
    * Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of 'x': x = 8

5. **Final answer:**
    * {The final answer is 8} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The capacity of the shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns is 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 books.
Double the capacity of the shelving system is 2*36=<<2*36=72>>72
If Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns, she wants to place 20+72=92 books.

* We want to determine the difference in the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk.
* Let 'f' represent the number of bags of flour Mark needs.
* Let 'm' represent the number of bottles of milk Mark needs.


**Step 3: Formulate an equation**

* We can use the given information to make an equation to relate the number of bags of flour to the number of bottles of milk.
* The ratio of flour bags to milk bottles is: 
    * f / m

 **Step 4:  Express the number of bags of flour in terms of the number of bottles of milk.** 
* We'll need to express the number of flour bags (f) in terms of the number of bottles of milk (m) 
* We can do this by noticing that the number of bags of flour is related to the number of bottles of milk. 


**Step 5: Solve for the difference**

* Finally, once you have an equation in terms of 'f' and 'm', find the difference between them (how many more flour bags than bottles of milk)

*Please explain each step clearly.


**Step 1:** Calculate the daily energy usage.

* **Reasoning:** We first need to find the total energy used by the AC in one day.
* **Calculation:** Energy usage (daily) = Power x Time
* Energy usage (daily) = 900 watts x 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours 
* **Final answer:** 7200 watt-hours

**Step 2:** Calculate the new daily energy usage.

* **Reasoning:** After reducing the use time, we need to calculate the new daily energy usage
* **Calculation:**  New energy usage (daily) = 900 watts x 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours
* **Final answer:** 2700 watt-hours 

**Step 3:** Find the difference in daily energy usage.

* **Reasoning:**  We find the difference between the daily energy usage before and after reducing the time the air conditioner was used.
* **Calculation:** Difference in energy usage = 7200 watt-hours - 2700 watt-hours = 4500 watt-hours
 * **Final answer:** 4500 watt-hours

 **Step 4:** Calculate the total energy saved over 30 days

* **Reasoning:** We will find the total energy saved over 30 days by multiplying the daily energy savings by 30.  
* **Calculation:** Total energy saved = 4500 watt-hours/day x 30 days = 135,000 watt-hours
* **Final answer:** 135,000 watt-hours




<end_of_turn><eos>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.
An air conditioner uses 900 x 5 = <<900*5=4500>>4500 watts for 5 hours a day.
So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

* Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.
* Tyson needs 5 pounds of cheese.
* Total cheese cost: 5 pounds * $3.00/pound = $15.00

**Step 6: Determine the total cost**

* Total meat cost: $35.00
* Total cheese cost: $15.00
* Total cost: $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

<end_of_turn><eos>","Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches
1 pound of meat cost $7.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 7*5 = $<<7*5=35.00>>35.00 for meat
1 pound of cheese cost $3.00 per sandwich and he had to make 5 so 3*5 = $<<3*5=15.00>>15.00 for cheese
When you add the meat and cheese together, he would spend 35+15 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00

**Solution:**

1. **Find the number of corn:** 
    * Allan has 60 more cannolis than corn. 
    * Therefore, he started with 40 cannolis / 2 = 20 corn.

2. **Find the initial amount of corn:**
    * Allan originally had 40 cannolis / 2 = 20 corn.

3. **Find the total number of cannolis:**
    * He bought 60 cannolis more to his initial number of 40.
    * The total number of cannolis he has is 40 + 60 = 100 

     {The final answer is 100}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.

Let's break down how we can solve this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the known information:**
    * Elliott needs to take 10,000 steps a day.
    * He did half his steps on his way to and from school. 
    * He also did another 1,000 steps during a short walk. 
    * After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.


2. **Calculate the steps taken on school walking:**
    * Half of his steps are from school = (10,000 steps/2) = 5,000 steps 
    * This means he took 5,000 steps during his school walking

3. **Calculate total steps taken before his jog:**
    * Total steps taken (before jogging) = 10,000 steps - 2,000 steps (left to take) = 8,000 steps 
 
4. **Calculate the total steps Elliott took from the start:**
   * Elliott's initial steps were 8,000 steps, plus the school walking steps 
   * total steps = (8000 steps + 5000 steps) 
 

5. **Calculate the steps from the short walk:**
    * 1,000 steps 
   



 {The final answer is 10,000.} 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It . takes 10 minutes to get to : the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?<end_of_turn>
  
Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total words Toby needs to read.**

* Words per book = pages * words per page 
* Words per book = 45 * 200 = 9000 words

**Step 2: Calculate the total time Toby needs to read the book.**

* Time = words / rate
* Time = 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes


**Step 3: Calculate the total travel time**

* Travel time = 10 minutes 

**Step 4: Calculate the total time Toby needs.**


* Total time = reading time + travel time
* Total time = 30 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes

**Step 5: Determine how early Toby will arrive.**

* Early time = Total time needed – airport arrival time
* Early time = 40 minutes – 60 minutes = -20 minutes


The final answer is -20 minutes.




<end_of_turn><eos>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5
It will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30
He will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40
He will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20

**Breakdown of Steps**

1. **Calculate the total earnings for May:**
   - Hourly rate: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Number of employees: 40
   - Total earnings for May: $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 40 employees = $24000

2. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - 1/4 of 40 employees = 10 employees.

3. **Calculate the total earnings for June:**
   - Hourly rate: $15
   - Hours per week: 40
   - Number of employees: 10
   - Total earnings for June: $15/hour * 40 hours/week * 10 employees = $6000

4. **Calculate the total earnings for both months:**
   - Total earnings for May: $24000
   - Total earnings for June: $6000
   - Total earnings: $24000 + $6000 = $30000

 


{The final answer is $30000}




<end_of_turn><eos>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the discount:** 
    - The offer is ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"". 
    - So, she gets 1/2 the price of the taffy.  This equals $3/2 = $1.50 per pound.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the taffy:**
    - She bought 2 pounds of taffy at $1.50 per pound. 
    - The cost of the taffy is 2 * $1.50 = $3.00
    
3. **Calculate the cost of the seashells:**
    - She spent $1.50 on seashells. 
    

4. **Calculate the cost of the magnets:**
    - She bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each.  
    - The cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.00 

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
    - Add the cost of the taffy, seashells, and magnets. 
    - This equals $3.00 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $5.50

6. **Calculate the money left:** 
    - She started with $10.00
    - She spent $5.50 on taffy, seashells, and magnets.
    - The final answer is $10.00 - $5.50 = { $4.50}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

He gets a 20% discount on them.  He also buys a finale firework that costs $150.  How much did he spend in total?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the steps:

**1. Calculate the cost of the second package:**

* The second package costs twice the price of the first package: $400 * 2 = $800
 
**2. Calculate the total cost of the fireworks:**

* Add the cost of the first package and the second package: $400 + $800 = $1200
 
**3. Calculate the discount amount:**

* Multiply the total cost by the discount percentage: $1200 * 0.20 = $240 

**4. Calculate the final cost of the fireworks:**

* Subtract the discount from the original cost: $1200 - $240 = $960


**5. Calculate the total cost, including the finale firework:**

* Add the cost of the fireworks to the finale firework cost: $960 + $150 = $1110


**The final answer is $1110.** 




<end_of_turn><eos>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800
So the two packages were worth 400+800=$<<400+800=1200>>1200

Her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies.  : How ! many . dozens of cookies will she need to make so she has enough for 30 days?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Understand the problem:**

* Shannon wants to make enough cookies to last her 30 days.
* She eats two cookies a night.
* Her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies (that's 12 cookies).
* How many dozens of cookies will she need to make for 30 days?

**2.  Calculate daily cookie consumption:**

* She eats 2 cookies a night, so in a day she consumes 2 cookies per night * 1 day = 2 cookies. 

**3. Determine total cookies needed:**

* To have enough cookies for 30 days, we need to find out how many cookies she needs to make in total.
* We need to multiply her daily cookie consumption by the number of days she wants to store them

 * Total cookies needed = Daily cookies consumption * Number of days
 * Total cookies needed = 2 cookies/day * 30 days = 60 cookies


**4. Determine the number of dozens needed:**

*  To determine the number of dozens, we need to divide the total cookies needed by the number of cookies per dozen.
* * Number of dozen cookies = Total cookies needed / Cookies per dozen 

* Number of dozen cookies = 60 cookies / 12 cookies/dozen = 5 dozens 
  


**5. Final Answer**

The final answer is: Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies.

* Please break down the problem into steps.


## Step-by-Step Solution

**1. Identify the Components**
* We need to understand the relationship between:
    *  The percentage of candles that have a smell defect.
    * The percentage of all candles that are guaranteed not to explode.
* We want to find out how many of those candles will have both a defect and an explosion risk.

**2. Understand the Relationships** 
* We're told that 5% of the candles with defects smell like wet dogs *and* are guaranteed not to explode. 
*   This means there’s a direct connection, as these conditions are interrelated.

**3. Define Possible Outcomes**
*   Since we have two distinct conditions, we should think about how they vary from each other. 
     * **Condition 1 - Defect:** A candle has a smell defect.
     * **Condition 2 - Explosion:** A candle is guaranteed not to explode.
 * We need to determine which outcome has a higher probability of occurring together.


**4. Apply a Probability Model**
* We know that 5% of all candles combine to smell like wet dog and NOT explode.  
*  The probability model will help us combine these two aspects.
{The final answer is 2500} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%
Then multiply the odds of the candles exploding by the odds of them smelling like wet dog to find the probability of both events happening: 1% * 5% = 0.05%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

* **Step 1**: Write down the information given in the problem.
    * Number of blouses: 4
    * Original price for each blouse: $20
    * Discount: 30% 
* **Step 2**:  Calculate the discount amount. 
    *   Discount = Original Price * Discount Percentage
    *   Discount = $20 * 0.30
    *   Discount = $6
* **Step 3**:  Calculate the price after the discount. 
    * Price after discount = Original Price - Discount
    * Price after discount = $20 - $6
    * Price after discount = $14
* **Step 4**:   Calculate the total cost.
    * Total cost = Price per blouse * Number of blouses

**Here's how we can break down the problem to find the solution:**

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'a' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees. 
* Let 't' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees.
* Let 'b' represent the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

**2. Set up equations based on given information:**

* **Equation 1:**  ""Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees"" :  
    * t = 30
    * a = t/2 = 30/2 = 15 apples 
* **Equation 2:** ""Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne""
        * t = 2 * t
        * t = 2 * 30
        * t = 60 apples
 
* **Equation 3:**  ""She doesn't take any from the average trees"" 
        * b = 0 

* **Equation 4:** ""The sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples.""
        * a + t + b = 500
        * 15 + 60 + 0 = 500

**3. Solve the equations for total apples from the average tree**

* After setting up the equations, we can solve the problem.




{The final answer is 15 apples} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

   - Let 'd' represent the number of dromedaries.

2. **Formulate Equations:**
   - We know the total heads:  c + d = 180 
   - We know the total bumps: 2c + d = 304

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - **Elimination method:**
      - Subtract the first equation from the second equation: 
        (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
        2c + d - c - d = 124
        c = 124 

      -Substitute the value of 'c' into either of the original equations to solve for 'd': 
        124 + d = 180
        d = 180 - 124
        d = 56


4. **The Solution:**


 {The final answer is: There are 56 dromedaries.} 
   

Let me know if you're looking for anything further! <end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

 kilometers

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the specific information we need to solve the problem.** 
    - We need to find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip.
2. **Break down the problem into smaller parts.**
    - We can first calculate the distance traveled in the first four days. 
    - Then, we can calculate the distance covered in the next two days
    - Then, we can find out the distance covered in the third week.
3. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first four days.**
    - Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for four days, so the total distance is 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 kilometers.
4. **Calculate the distance covered in the next two days.**
    - 30% of the distance traveled in the first four days is 800 km * 0.30 = 240 kilometers.
5. **Calculate the total distance covered in the first four days and next two days.**
    - The total distance would be 800 kilometers + 240 kilometers= 1040 kilometers.
6. **Determine the distance covered in the third week.**
    - Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for two days, so he traveled 300 km/day * 2 days = 600 kilometers.  
7. **Add all the distances to find Tom's total distance.**
   - 1040 kilometers + 600 kilometers = 1640 kilometers.


**Final Answer: {Tom made 1640 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.}** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine Zack's locker size:**

* Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's.
*  We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.
* Let 'x' represent the size of Zack's locker. 
*  Therefore, 1/4 * x = 5 cubic inches

**2. Solve for x:**

* Multiply both sides of the equation by 4:  x = 20 cubic inches

**3. Determine Timothy's locker size:**

* Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's.
* Therefore, Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's: 2 * 20 cubic inches 

**4. Find Timothy's locker size:**

*  2 * 20 cubic inches = 40 cubic inches


**Final Answer: Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.**

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understanding the Problem:**

* Stanley starts at 10,000 feet.
* The comb falls 4,000 feet to a ledge below.
* Oliver is at 3,000 feet.
* Stanley needs Oliver to find the comb.

**2. Calculating the Difference in Elevation:**

* The comb fell 4,000 feet from Stanley's initial elevation to the ledge below.
* We need to find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb's elevation.

**3. The Solution:**

* To find the distance Oliver needs to climb, we subtract his starting elevation from the comb's final elevation. 
* Calculation:  10,000 feet - 4,000 feet = 6,000 feet

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Identify the given information:**

*  First Bank gave Mr. Josue: $4000.
*  The second company gave Mr. Josue: Twice the amount of the first bank.
*  Mr. Josue's initial capital: $5000.

**2. Determine the amount from the second bank:**

*  Twice the amount of the first bank is: 2 * $4000 = $8000.

**3. Calculate the total capital from both banks:**

*  Total capital from both banks is: $4000 + $8000 = $12000.

**4. Calculate his current capital:**

*  His current capital is: $5000 + $12000 = $17000.

 
**The final answer is $17000** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If the second bank gave him twice as much money as the first bank, he received 2*$4000 = $<<2*4000=8000>>8000 from the second bank.

tattered jeans: $28
jogger jeans: ?


**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the price of the jogger jeans:**
    * The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22. 

2. **Calculate the total cost of the jeans:**
    * The tattered jeans cost $28 and the jogger jeans cost $22. 
    *  So the total cost is $28 + $22 = $50. 

3. **Calculate the amount Cole saved from the jogger jeans:**
    * He saved 1/3 of the total savings, so he saved (1/3) * $50 = $16.67, rounded to two decimal places.

4. **Calculate the amount he spent on the jogger jeans:**
    * He saved $16.67, so the jogger jeans originally cost $50 - $16.67 = $33.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

5. **Calculate the difference between the jogger jeans price and the tattered jeans price:**
    * We know the jogger jeans originally cost $33.33 and the tattered jeans cost $28.
    * Therefore, they originally cost $33.33 - $28 = $5.33 more than the tattered jeans



**Final answer:** {The jogger jeans originally cost $5.33 more than the tattered jeans.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Buses:**

* Each bus can hold 60 employees.
* We have 4 buses.

**2. Minibuses:**

* Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
* We have 6 minibusses.

**3. Minivans:**

* Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
* We have 10 minivans. 


**4. Total Capacity:**

We need to add up the number of people each type of transportation can hold:
* Buses: 4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees 
* Minibuses: 6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees
* Minivans: 10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees 

 **5. Total Capacity of All Transportation:**

* Finally, we add the number of employees from each transport to find the total.


**Answer:** {The final answer is 570 employees} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
    - Let `x` represent the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders.
    - Let `y` represent the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    - We know `x = 10 + y`     (Homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than store-bought feeders).
    -  We also know that 20 birds are attracted to each feeder, so each feeder attracts `20` birds.

3. **Express the total number of birds in terms of `x` and `y`:**
   - The total birds attracted by each bird feeder is 20, and there are 3 homemade feeders. So we have this equation  `3 * 20 = x + y`

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
    - We now have two equations:
       - `x = 10 + y` 
       - `3 * 20 = x + y`
    - Substitute the first equation into the second equation: 
       - `3 * 20 = (10 + y) + y`
      - Simplify to solve for `y`: 
        - `60 = 10 + 2y`
        - `50 = 2y`
        - `y = 25` 
    - Substitute  `y` into the first equation:
      - `x = 10 + 25`
      - `x = 35`


5. **Determine the total number of birds:**
    - The same amount of birds come to the feeders, so we get the total `x` birds attracted. 

{The final answer is 35} 


 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the cost of the soup. 
* Let 'y' represent the cost of the cake.
 
**2. Set up the equations based on the information provided:**

* **Equation 1:** The bagel costs $4. 
   * This is a given fact. 
* **Equation 2:** The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
    * This translates to:  x = 1.25(4) 
* **Equation 3:** The cake is half the price of the bagel. 
    * This translates to: y = 0.5(4)

**3. Solve for x (cost of the soup):**
* Equation 2: x = 5 

**4. Solve for y (cost of the cake):**
* Equation 3: y = 2

**5. Calculate the total cost:**

* The final price is the sum of all costs. 
* Total cost = soup cost + bagel cost + cake cost
* Total cost = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11


{The final answer is $11.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.

However, 40 , guests showed ! up, and everyone wanted ; a , second hotdog. How , many : guests did , not . get : a second hotdog?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the number of guests expecting two hot dogs.**

* Half of the guests is (1/2) * 36 = 18 guests.

**2. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed.**

* Since half the guests want two hot dogs, the caterer needs enough for 18 guests * 2 = 36 hot dogs.    

**3. Consider the unexpected guest count.**

*  40 guests showed up, which is more than the expected number.


**4. Determine how many guests didn't have a second hot dog** .


* 40 guests - 18 guests = 22 guests 


**The final answer is 22.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.
If 40 people wanted seconds, he would have needed 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 hot dogs.
80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 people did not get second hotdogs.

* Let  'x' represent the number of letters in Indras' name. 
* The number of letters in her sister's name is 'x + 4'

**2. Set up the Equation:**

* We know Indras' name has 6 letters, so x = 6.

**3. Solve for the sister's name:**

* The sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name, so the statement becomes:  x+ 4 = (x / 2) + 4 
* Substitute x = 6: 6 + 4 = (6 / 2) + 4

*Please provide detailed steps.*

**Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:**

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* We have 15 gallons of gasoline.
*  We'll divide this evenly into 5 containers.
*  Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. We need to figure out how many pints she needs.

**Step 2: Figure out the amount of gasoline per container**

*  Divide the total gallons by the number of containers: 15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container.

**Step 3: Determine Josey's required gasoline**

* We know Josey needs 1/4 of a container, which is equal to 3 gallons / 4.
* This equivalent is 0.75 gallons 


**Step 4: Determine the required pint amount**

* To convert gallons to pints, we realize 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints.
* Multiply the required gallons by 8 to find the equivalent in pints.
* 0.75 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints.



**The final answer is 6 pints of gasoline.**




<end_of_turn><eos>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container

* Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 pounds * 2 = 4 pounds of onions.

**2. Calculate the total number of servings the recipe makes:**

* The soup serves 6 people. 
* So, the recipe can serve 6 people * 2 = 12 servings. 

**3. Determine the cost of the onions:**

* The onions are $2.00 per pound.
* He needs 4 pounds of onions, so the cost of the onions is $2.00/pound * 4 pounds = $8.00.


**4. Determine the cost of the beef stock:**

* The beef stock costs $2.00 per box. 
* Antoine needs 2 boxes, so the cost of the beef stock is $2.00/box * 2 boxes = $4.00.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater from her apartment.
* Let '4x' represent the time it takes Wayne to drive from his hotel to the theater. 

**2. Establish Relationships:**

* Bernadette's drive to the theater is x minutes.
* Wayne's drive to the theater takes 4x minutes.
* Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 

**3.  Set Up the Equation:**

* We know Bernadette's drive plus 5 minutes needs to account for Wayne's drive. Therefore, the time constraint can be expressed as:
  x + 5 = 4x


**4. Solve for x:**

* Subtract x from both sides of the equation: 
  5 = 3x

* Divide both sides by 3:
  x = 5/3

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:** We are given the area of the room (360 square feet) and the length of the room (3 yards). We need to find the perimeter, which is the total distance around the room's outside.

2. **Recall the formulas:**
    * Area of a rectangle = length × width
    * Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + width)

3. **Find the width:**
    * We know the area (360 square feet) and the length (3 yards).  
    * Convert yards to feet: 3 yards × 3 feet/yard = 9 feet
    * Now we have: length = 9 feet, and Area = 360 square feet. 
    * We can use the area formula to solve for the width: 360 = 9 × width
    * Divide both sides by 9: width = 40 feet.

4. **Calculate the perimeter:**
    * Now that we have the length and width, we can use the perimeter formula: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width) 
    * Substitute the values: Perimeter = 2 × (9 feet + 40 feet)
    * Simplify: Perimeter = 2 × 49 feet = 98 feet 

5. **Answer the question:**  {The final answer is 98 feet} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.
The width of the room is 360 square feet / 9 feet = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.
The room's perimeter is 2(40+9) = 98

Elizabeth ? bought , 1 ! pack of red ; and 2 packs , of ! clear beads, , while Margareth ! bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads. How many more ; beads do one sister have , than the other, if each pack of beads contains 20 ; pieces of beads?<end_of_turn>
 Elizabeth's total beads: __________
 Margareth's total beads: __________
Difference between the two sisters: __________

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Elizabeth's red beads:**
   - Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads, so she has 1 * 20 = 20 red beads.

2. **Calculate Elizabeth's clear beads:**
   - Elizabeth bought 2 packs of clear beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads, so she has 2 * 20 = 40 clear beads.

3. **Calculate Margareth's blue beads:**
   - Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads, so she has 3 * 20 = 60 blue beads.

4. **Calculate Margareth's red beads:**
   - Margareth bought 4 packs of red beads.
   - Each pack contains 20 beads, so she has 4 * 20 = 80 red beads. 

5. **Calculate Elizabeth's total beads:**
   - Elizabeth has 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads

6. **Calculate Margareth's total beads:**
   - Margareth has 60 blue beads + 80 red beads = 140 beads.

7. **Find the difference.**
   - Elizabeth has 60 beads, and Margareth has 140 beads. 
   - The difference is 140 - 60 = 80 beads .




{The final answer is 80 beads} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.
So Elizabeth bought 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 pieces of beads.
Margareth bought 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 packs.
So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Then Marcus opens ; a window for 30 minutes, and ? the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is ; open. What is the ! house's final temperature?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the total temperature increase from baking:**

* The oven increases the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
* Marcus bakes for 3 hours.
* Total temperature increase from baking: 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees

**2. Calculate the house's temperature after baking:**

* Initial temperature: 40 degrees.
* Temperature increase from baking: 15 degrees.
* New temperature after baking: 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

**3. Calculate the cooling effect from the window:** 

* The window cools the house by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes.
*  30 minutes is equal to 30/10 = 30/6 parts, or 5 parts
* cooling effect: 2 degrees/part * 5 parts = 10 degrees

**4. Calculate the final temperature of the house:**

* New temperature after baking: 55 degrees.
* Cooling effect: 10 degrees.
* Final temperature: 55 degrees - 10 degrees = 45 degrees 

 {The final answer is 45 degrees}




<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let `x` represent the length of Movie B in minutes. 
* Movie C's length is 1.25 hours, which we need to convert to minutes:  1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes.

**2. Set Up Equations Based on Given Information**

*  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B:  Length of Movie A = (1/4) * Length of Movie B 
* Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C: Length of Movie B = Length of Movie C + 5

**3. Substitute and Simplify**

 We can now substitute the length of Movie C in our earlier equation:
* Length of Movie A = (1/4) * (Length of Movie C + 5) 


**4. Solve for the Length of Movie A**

* Length of Movie A = (1/4) *( 75 minutes + 5 minutes)  
* Length of Movie A = (1/4) * 80 minutes
* Length of Movie A = 20 minutes


 

**{The final answer is 20 minutes}** 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes

If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how ? much change does he have after he buys the ; hay?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the distance the horse runs.** 

* The horse runs at 32 MPH for 30 minutes. 
*  First, convert minutes to hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours
*  Then, use the distance formula: Distance = Speed x Time
* The distance is 32 MPH * 0.5 hours = 16 miles

**2. Calculate the amount of hay needed.**

*  The horse needs 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile.
*  The horse needs 16 miles * (1/2 bail/mile) = 8 bales of hay.

**3. Calculate the total cost of the hay.**

*  Each bale of hay costs $3.
*  The total cost is 8 bales * $3/bale = $24.

**4. Determine Michael's total money.**

*  He has six 5 dollar bills.
*  Total money is 6 * $5 = $30

**5.  Calculate the change Michael receives.**

*  Change is how much money is left after paying for the hay
* Change = Total Money - Total Cost 
*  Change = $30 - $24 = $6 



{The final answer is $6}<end_of_turn><eos>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16
The horse needs to eat 8 bails of hay because 16 x .5 = <<16*.5=8>>8
The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

She puts out trays that . each hold 5 glasses of eggnog. If each . glass needs . 5 eggs, how : many ; trays can Rozanne put ! out?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step explanation:

**1. Calculate the total number of eggs:**

*  A dozen has 12 eggs, so 4 dozen eggs = 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.
*  She also has 2 loose eggs, so there are a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

**2. Determine the number of trays Rozanne can accommodate:**

* Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, and each glass needs 5 eggs, so she can accommodate (50 eggs) / 5 eggs per glass = 10 trays.


{The final answer is 10 trays} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the original cost per balloon:**  
   - We know the total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Divide the total cost by the number of balloons to find the original cost per balloon: $900 / 20 = $45. 

2. **Account for the price increase:** 
   - The price of each balloon increased by $20.
   - The new cost per balloon is the original cost plus $20: $45 + $20 = $65.

3. **Calculate the cost for 170 balloons:**
   - Multiply the new cost per balloon by the new number of balloons: $65 * 170 = $11,050


{The final answer is $11,050}

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Identify the two segments of the trip.**

*  The problem breaks down the trip into two sections:
    *   A first segment at a constant speed of 60 mph for 2 hours.
    *   A second segment at a constant speed of 30 mph for 1 hour.

**2. Calculate the distance traveled in each segment.**

* **Segment 1:**
    * Distance = Speed x Time 
    * Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours 
    * Distance = 120 miles

* **Segment 2:**
    * Distance = Speed x Time
    * Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
    * Distance = 30 miles

**3. Calculate the total distance traveled.**

* Total distance = Distance1 + Distance2
* Total distance = 120 miles + 30 miles 
* Total distance = 150 miles

**4. Calculate the average speed.**

* Average speed = Total distance / Total time
* Average speed = 150 miles / (2 hours + 1 hour)
* Average speed = 150 miles / 3 hours 
 
**5. Simplified Average speed**

* Average speed = 50 mph

{The final answer is 50 mph.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

Here is the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

*   **Step 1: Determine the total apples eaten per day.** 
   *  Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples each per day.
   * Total apples eaten per day: 4 apples/day * 2 people = 8 apples/day

*   **Step 2: Calculate the total apples eaten in 30 days.**
   * Total apples over 30 days: 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

{The final answer is 240 apples}

Let's break down the solution:

**1. Calculate the Volume of One Bed:**

* **Width:** 2 feet
* **Length:** 8 feet
* **Height:** 2 feet
* **Volume of one bed:**  Width x Length x Height = 2 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet = 32 cubic feet

**2. Calculate the Total Volume Needed**

* **Number of beds:** 10
* **Total volume needed:** 32 cubic feet/bed x 10 beds = 320 cubic feet

**3. Determine the Number of Bags Needed**

* **Total volume needed:** 320 cubic feet 
* **Volume per bag:** 2 cubic feet 
* **Number of bags needed:** 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags

**4. Calculate the Total Cost**

* **Cost per bag:** $12
* **Number of bags needed:** 160 bags
* **Total cost:** $12/bag x 160 bags = $1920


{The final answer is $1920} 
 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

Here's how we can solve it step-by-step: 

**1. Calculate the number of green cards:**

* 60% of 15 red cards = (60/100) * 15 = 9 green cards.
* Total green cards = 9 + 15 = 24 green cards.

**2. Determine the number of yellow cards:**

* Yellow cards = Red cards + Green cards = 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.

**3. Calculate the total number of cards:**

* Total cards = Red cards + Green cards + Yellow cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.


 {The final answer is 78} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.
Which means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.
Yellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.
So in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.

*step 1: * state the problem
*step 2: * describe events and gather information

**The Final Answer is:** 20 fairies remain 


**Step 1: State the Problem**

Katelyn saw 50 fairies flying above the forest while playing with her friends at school. One friend sees half the number of fairies Katelyn saw. Then, more fairies come from the east, doubling the number of fairies already present. They fly away ten minutes later. How many fairies remain?

**Step 2: Describe Events and Gather Information**

* **Start:** Katelyn saw 50 fairies. 
    * One friend saw half that, which leads to the number of fairies being 50/2=25 fairies.
*   **More fairies:** They come from the east and join the existing fairies.
*   **More fairies leave:** 30 fairies fly away.


**Final Thought!**
<end_of_turn><eos>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw
The total number of fairies flying above the forest now is 50 + 25 = <<50+25=75>>75
If thirty fairies then flew away, there were 75 - 30 = <<75-30=45>>45 fairies that remained.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the number of spotted puppies from each dog:**

* **Jennifer's dog:** 3 puppies have spots.
* **Brandon's dog:** 4 puppies have spots. 

**2. Find the total number of spotted puppies:**

* **Jennifer's puppies:** 3 
* **Brandon's puppies:** 4

* **Jennifer's puppies:** 8
* **Brandon's puppies:** 12
* **Total puppies:** 8 + 12 = 20

**4. Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots:**

* **Percentage of spotted puppies:** (Number of spotted puppies / Total number of puppies) * 100%
* **Percentage of spotted puppies:** (7 / 20) * 100% 
*  **Percentage of spotted puppies:** 0.35 * 100%

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning and steps:

**1.  Identify the Foods:**

*   **Hay:** The main food for his horses and bought in large quantities.
*   **Oats:** A supplement to hay and bought in smaller quantities.
*   **Sugar Cubes:** A rare treat bought in limited quantities.
*   **Carrots:** Used as a supplement to hay and oats, bought in large quantities.

**2. Calculate Amounts in POUNDS:**

*   **Hay:** 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
*   **Oats:** 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
*   **Sugar Cubes:** 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
*   **Carrots:** 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds

**3. Determine the Total Weight:** 

*  Add the weights of each food: 3150 pounds + 1300 pounds + 2 pounds + 48 pounds = 4500 pounds.
 

**4. Calculate Number of Trips:**

*   Divide total weight by load capacity: 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips. 



**The final answer is: The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He is buying 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 pounds of carrots.
He is buying 42 * 75 = <<42*75=3150>>3150 pounds of hay bales.
He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

value of cans 

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the earnings from cans per week:**
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week.
   - Earnings from cans per week: 2 cents/can * 3 cans = 6 cents

2. **Calculate the earnings from bottles per week:**
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week.
   - Earnings from bottles per week: 3 cents/bottle * 5 bottles = 15 cents

3. **Calculate total weekly earnings:**
   - Total weekly earnings: 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

4. **Calculate total earnings for a four-week month:**

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate Toni's plants:**
   * Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, who has 10. 
   * 60% of 10 is (60/100) * 10 = 6 plants.
   * Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.

**Solution:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let 'x' represent the amount Ashley ordered.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   - The tip is equal to 1/5 of the order amount. 
   - This can be written as: (1/5) * x = tip amount 
   - The total amount Ashley should pay is the order amount plus the tip.
   - This is written as: x + (1/5) * x = Total Amount


3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Combine the x terms on the left-side of the equation: [1 + (1/5)] * x = Total Amount
   - Simplify the fraction: (6/5) * x = Total Amount

4. **Solve for the total amount:** 
   - Multiply both sides of the equation by (5/6) to isolate the total amount. 

   {The final answer is: Total Amount = (6/5) * x }

*Note: This problem is best explained step-by-step, using clear and concise language.* 
 


## Solution:
1. **Calculate the total basketball cards:**
   - Miss Maria has 6 decks * 25 cards/deck = 150 basketball cards.
2. **Calculate the total baseball cards:**
   - Miss Maria has 5 boxes * 40 cards/box = 200 baseball cards.
3. **Calculate the total cards in her collection:** 
   - Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards.
4. **Calculate the number of cards given to students:**
   - Miss Maria keeps 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards.
5. **Calculate the number of students:**
   - Each student gets 10 cards, and Miss Maria gave 300 cards to students, so she has 300 cards / 10 cards/student = 30 students.

Here's the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost**

* Cost per apple: $0.45
* Number of apples: 20
* Total cost for Becky: $0.45 * 20 = $9.00

**Step 2: Calculate the discount Becky received.**

* Discount amount: $1.00
* Total cost before discount: $9.00
* Total cost after discount: $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00

**Step 3: Calculate Kelly's total cost**

* Cost per apple: $0.50
* Number of apples: 20
* Total cost for Kelly: $0.50 * 20 = $10.00

**Step 4: Calculate Kelly's discount**

* Discount amount: $0.10 (10% of $10.00)

**Step 5: Calculate Kelly's total cost after discount**
* Total cost after discount: $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00

**Step 6: Find the difference in costs**

* Cost for Becky: $8.00
* Cost for Kelly: $9.00
* Difference: $9.00 - $8.00 = $1.00

 


{The final answer is $1.00}<end_of_turn><eos>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.

*  Explain what the problem is asking you to do
*   Start to break down solving this problem
*   Find the number of each type of item needed, in 80 rooms
*   Calculate the number of types of laundry needed for 80 rooms

**Here's a breakdown of the reasoning**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** 
   * The problem asks us to calculate how much laundry Bob needs for 80 hotel rooms. 
   * We need to figure out how many sheets, comforters, pillowcases, and towels are needed in each room, and then multiply that by 80 to find the total. 

2. **Breaking down the calculation steps:**
   * **Rooms:** The problem tells us there are 80 rooms.
   * **Sheets:** Each room needs 2 sheets.
   * **Comforters:** Each room needs 1 comforter.
   * **Pillowcases:** Each room uses twice the amount of sheets so there 2x2 = 4 pillow cases.
   * **Towels:** Each room uses twice the amount of pillowcases so there 4x2 = 8 towels.

3. **Calculating for each item:**
   * We need the number of items per room to calculate for the total.
   * *Sheets:* 2 
   * *Comforters:* 1
   * *Pillowcases:* 4
   * *Towels:* 8

4. **Calculating total laundry.**
  * *Sheets:* 2 * 80 = 160
  * *Comforters:* 1 * 80 = 80
  * *Pillowcases:* 4 * 80 = 320
  * *Towels:* 8 * 80 = 640


**Answer:** The final answer is: 160 sheets, 80 comforters, 320 pillowcases, 640 towels. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases
Then find the number of towels in each room: 4 pillow cases * 2 towels/pillow case = <<4*2=8>>8 towels
Then find the number of pieces of laundry in each room: 4 pillow cases + 8 towels + 2 sheets + 1 comforter = <<4+8+2+1=15>>15 pieces of laundry
Then multiply the number of pieces of laundry in each room by the number of rooms to find the total: 15 pieces of laundry/room * 80 rooms = <<15*80=1200>>1200 pieces

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shoes Frank gains.**

* Monday: 5 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 10 shoes
* Wednesday: 15 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 30 shoes
* Friday: 30 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 60 shoes
* Total: 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of shoes Frank has after his gains.**

* Starting shoes: 200 shoes
* Shoes gained: 100 shoes
* Total: 200 + 100 = 300 shoes

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of shoes Frank loses.**

* Shoes lost: 180 shoes. 

**Step 4: Calculate the final number of shoes Frank has on Sunday.**

*  Total shoes: 300 shoes
*  Shoes lost: -180 shoes
*  Final number: 300 - 180 = 120 shoes

{The final answer is 120} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.
When he gets 30 pairs on Friday, the total number of new pairs of shoes he has is 20+30 = <<30+20=50>>50 pairs of shoes.
Since a pair have 2 shoes, 50 pairs would be 2*50 = <<50*2=100>>100 shoes.
The total number of shoes that Fireman Frank has by Saturday is 200+100 = <<200+100=300>>300
On Sunday, after he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he remains with 300-180 = <<300-180=120>>120

Let's break down the problem.


**Step 1:** Figure out the total length of the remoras in inches.
* The remoras are 6 inches each. 
* There are 2 remoras. 
* The total length of the remoras is 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches.

**Step 2:** Convert the shark's length to inches.
* The shark is 10 feet long.
* 10 feet * 12 inches/foot = 120 inches.


**Step 3:** Divide the remoras' length in inches by the shark's length in inches.
* 12 inches / 120 inches = 0.1

**Step 4:** Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.

Here's how we can break it down:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We know that  ¾ of students at this grade level have desktop computers at home.
* We know that some students don't have desktop computers.
* We're trying to find the total number of students at this grade level.

**2.  Define Unknown Variables:**

* Let ""x"" represent the total number of students at the grade level.


**3. Set Up the Equation:**

* We know that 20 students do not have desktop computers. 
* This means that all of those students are not part of the ""have desktop"" group.

* Using the information, we can write the equation: 
  **(3/4)x - 20 = x**

 
**4. Solve for 'x':**
 * We perform operations to solve for the value of x. 

 **5. Simplify and solve for x:**

* **(3/4)x = x + 20**
* **(3/4)x - x = 20**
* **(3/4)x - (4/4)x = 20**
* **-(1/4)x = 20** 
* **x = 20 * -4**
* **x = -80**


**6. Interpret the Solution:**

* The number of students cannot be negative. 
* The problem is contradictory and it is not possible that only 20 students wouldn't have a desktop computer, given they make up 3/4 of the student population.

 


**Final answer is: This is a contradiction and there is no possible solution to this problem. **



<end_of_turn><eos>","Twenty students represent 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of the students at that level.
So, there are 4 x 20 students = <<4*20=80>>80 students at that level.

    * Price per book: $15
    * Number of children: 4

2. **Set up an equation:** 
    *  We are looking to find the number of books given to each child. Since all the children received the same number of books. 
    * We can use this equation: Total spend = Number of books * price per book

3. **Solve for the number of books:**
    * Plug in the knowns into the equation : $300 = Number of books * $15 
    * Divide both sides by $15 : $300 / $15 = Number of books
    * This simplifies to: 20 = Number of books

4. **Find the number of books per child:** 
   * Since Sarah gave books equally to her 4 children,  each child received 20/4 = 5 books.


**The final answer is 5 books.  **

**Solution**

1. **Identify the information given:**
    * The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.
    * The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. 

2. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:**
    *  The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny.
    *  Three-quarters of 48 grains is (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.

3. **Calculate the combined weight:**
    *  Add the weight of the 1959 penny and the weight of the 2010 penny: 48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains. 

  
**The Final Answer is 84 grains**<end_of_turn><eos>","If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains

**Solution**

1. **Calculate daily oats consumption:**
   * Each horse eats 5 pounds per meal * 2 meals = 10 pounds of oats per day. 
   *  He has 4 horses * 10 pounds/horse = 40 pounds of oats per day.

2. **Calculate total oats consumption for five days:**
   * 40 pounds/day * 5 days = 200 pounds of oats. 

3. **Determine the number of bags needed:**
   * 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags. 



{The final answer is 4 bags}<end_of_turn><eos>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.
Thus, they can consume 2 x 20 pounds = <<2*20=40>>40 pounds of oats a day.
So, uncle Ben needs 5 x 40 pounds = <<5*40=200>>200 pounds of oats to fed his horses for five days.
Therefore, uncle Ben needs 200/50 = <<200/50=4>>4 bags of oats.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the original price of both razors:**

- The price of one pack is $4.00.
- Since it's ""Buy one get one free,"" we'll buy two packs to find the final price 
 
**2. Determine the price after the sale:** 

* With the ""Buy one get one free"" offer, Heather effectively gets two razors for the price of one pack. 
* The price of a pack is $4.00.

**3. Apply the coupon:**
* The coupon is $2.00,  which  subtracts it from the discounted price.


**4. Calculate the final cost in cents**

* To get the cost each razor will cost in cents, you'll calculate the discounted price of two packs and divide by 2

**Step by step solution:**

*Note: This problem focuses on calculating quantity and understanding basic unit work.*

**Solution:**

1. **Find Ashley's total oranges:**
    * Ashley's oranges: 5 boxes * 10 oranges/box = 50 oranges

2. **Find Brianne's oranges:**
    * Brianne's oranges: 50 oranges + 20 oranges = 70 oranges

3. **Find the total oranges:**
    * Total oranges: 50 oranges + 70 oranges = 120 oranges 

4. **Calculate the number of pies:**
    * Pies: 120 oranges / 3 oranges/pie = 40 pies


**The final answer is 40 greek orange pies.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.
Brianne brought 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 oranges.

                    question:
                    ; Mark is trying to choose between two venues : for , a ; surprise ; party , for his wife.  : The first venue charges a flat fee ; of , $200, regardless of ; how many ; guests attend. .

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of guests. 

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* **Venue 1:** Total Cost = Flat Fee + Food Cost 
   * Cost = $200 + ($5/guest * x)
* **Venue 2:** Total Cost = Price per guest * Number of guests
   * Cost = $25 * x

**3.  Set the two equations equal to each other:** 

Since both venues should cost the same, we can set their cost expressions equal to each other:
  * $200 + ($5/guest * x) = $25 * x

**4. Solve for 'x':**

*  Simplify the equation: 
    * $200 + $5x/guest = $25x
* Move all terms with 'x' to one side:
   * $200 = $20x
* Solve for x:
  * x = $200 / $20 
  * x = 10


**Answer:** 
The final answer is 10 guests. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

{The final answer is }



Here's how we can solve the problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let  'B' represent the number of insects Bodhi found.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's insects = David's insects + 7.
* David found half of what Bodhi found, so David's insects = (1/2) * B.

**3. Use the information about the total number of insects to find the number of David's insects:**

* Total insects = Lily's insects + David's insects + Bodhi's insects
* 43 = (David's insects + 7) + (1/2)*B + B
* 43 = (David's insects + 7) + (3/2)*B 

**4. Substitute the known values and solve for David's insects:**

* We need to isolate David's insects:
   * David's insects = 43 - 7 - (3/2)*B

**5. Combine the known equations and solve:**

* We have now set up a combined equation 
* {The final answer is }


**Let me know if you'd like to work through any further steps!**

**Here's the breakdown:**

1. **Understand the problem:** We need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used together.  

2. **Break down the information:**  
   - Mariah used 1/4 of a skein.
   - Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein.
   - Each skein has 364 yards of yarn.

3. **Convert the fractions to decimals:**
   - This is helpful to see the amount in detail.
   
 4. **Calculate the yarn used by Mariah:** 
   - 1/4 of a skein = 1/4 * 364 yards = 91 yards 

5. **Calculate the yarn used by her grandma:**
   - 1/2 of a skein = 1/2 * 364 yards = 182 yards 

6. **Calculate the total yarn used:**
   - Add Mariah's yarn and grandma's yarn together.

7. **Write the answer:**
     {The final answer is 91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

Here's how we can solve the problem step by step:

**1. Determine the width of the rug:**

* The chair is 3 feet wide.
* The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
*  Therefore, the width of the rug = Chair width + 5 feet = 3 feet + 5 feet = 8 feet.

**2. Find the width of the rug in terms of twice the rug's width:**

* We have already determined that the rug's width is 8 feet.
* Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 feet = 16 feet.

**3. Calculate the length of the couch:**

* The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
*  Therefore, the length of the couch = 16 feet + 2 feet = 18 feet.

 {The final answer is 18 feet}

Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out the cost of the green apple gum:**

* Suzie spent $7 in total.
* She spent $2 on grape gum. 
* That means she spent $7 - $2 = $5 on other gum.
* The green apple gum cost half as much as the strawberry gum, so it cost $5 / 2 = $2.50 

**2. Determine the cost of strawberry gum:**

*  The strawberry gum cost  $2
* The green apple gum cost $2.50
 

{The final answer is $2} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
Thus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

*This problem requires us to think about fractions and proportions*


**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'o' represent the number of onions Sophia bought.
   * Let 'p' represent the number of potatoes Sophia bought.

2. **Set up equations based on given information:**
   * We know Rose bought four times the amount Sophia did.

3. **Solve for o using the first equation:**
   * 4o = 12
   * o = 12/4
   * o = 3 onions 

4. **Solve for p using the second equation:**
   * p = 4 * 3
   * p = 12 potatoes

5. **Calculate total onions and potatoes:**
    * Total onions: 3 onions 
    * Total potatoes: 12 potatoes


**The final answer is:** Sophia bought 3 onions and 12 potatoes.

Here's a breakdown of the problem and our solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on clothes**

*  20% of $500 is (20/100) * $500 = $100. 
  
**Step 2: Calculate the money remaining after buying clothes**

*  Julie starts with $500 and spends $100 on clothes.
*  The remaining amount is $500 - $100 = $400.

**Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on CDs**

*  25% of $400 is (25/100) * $400 = $100.

**Step 4: Calculate the final amount Julie has.**

* Julie started with $500 and spent $100 on clothes and $100 on CDs.
* The final amount left is $500 - $100 - $100 = $300.


{The final answer is $300}

{The answer is}


**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**  
    * Let 'x' represent the cost of the lot. 
    * The house costs three times the lot, so its cost is 3x.

2. **Set up the equation:** 
    * The total cost is the sum of the lot and the house's price.  
    *  x + 3x = $120,000

3. **Solve for x:**
    * Combine like terms: 4x = $120,000
    * Divide both sides by 4: x = $30,000

4. **Calculate the cost of the house:**
    *  The house costs 3 times the lot, so: 3x = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

5. **Answer:**
    * The house cost $90,000.  {The final answer is} $90,000 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

Here's how we can break down the problem to find the solution:

**1. Bobby's rate:**

* Tony picks 6 quarts per hour.
* Bobby picks 1 less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.

**2. Kathy's rate:**

* Bobby picks 5 quarts per hour.
* Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.

**3. Ricky's rate:**

* Kathy picks 10 quarts per hour.
* Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.

**4. Total Strawberries per hour:**

* Tony: 6 quarts/hour
* Bobby: 5 quarts/hour
* Kathy: 10 quarts/hour
* Ricky: 8 quarts/hour 


**The final answer is:** 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 33 quarts of strawberries per hour.

* He uses specific combinations of red and blue tulips.
* We know how many of each he buys.

**2. Set up variables:**

* Let 'r' represent the number of rows of red tulips.
* Let 'b' represent the number of rows of blue tulips.

**3. Formulate equations:**

* **Red tulips:** He has 36 red tulips, and he can fit 6 red per row. 
   * This means 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.
* **Blue tulips:** He has 24 blue tulips, and he can fit 8 blue per row.
   * This means 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips. 

**4.  Analysis:** 

* The problem wants the number of rows of flowers in total, therefore, we need to find out how many rows of red tulips and blue tulips he is planting.

**5. Conclusion:**

How many batches ? of oatmeal cookies : can Heather make , if : she divides , the ; bag of raisins equally among the cookies, ! granola, and : snack , mix?<end_of_turn>
*Hint: Use fractions*


Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   * Heather has a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups.
   * She wants to make different batches of oatmeals cookies, granola, and snack mix.
   * Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 cup of raisins. 

2. **Determine the total cups of raisins for the oatmeal cookies:**
    *  Multiply the total cups of raisins by the amount required for each batch of cookies. 
    * Total cups of raisins needed = (27 cups) x (3/4 cup/batch)

3. **Simplify and calculate:**
    * Total cups of raisins needed = 27 cups x (3/4 cup/batch) 
    * Total cups of raisins needed = (27 x 3) / 4 cups/batch 
    * Total cups of raisins needed = 20.25 cups / batch. 
 *Rounded to the nearest whole number, Heather can make 20 batches of oatmeals cookies.* 

4. **Final Answer:** {The final answer is 20 batches} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.
Thus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**1. Calculate the new total consumption:**

*  Ada's original consumption: 12 kilowatts/hour
*  New device consumption: 2 kilowatts/hour
*  Total consumption: 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts/hour

**2. Determine the weekly consumption:**

* Ada's daily consumption: 14 kilowatts/hour
* Weekly consumption: 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts/week

**3. Calculate the weekly cost before the new device:**

*  Cost per kilowatt-hour: $1.50
*  Weekly consumption: 98 kilowatts/week
*  Weekly cost before new device: 98 * $1.50 = $147.00

**4. Calculate the weekly cost after the new device:**

* Cost per kilowatt-hour: $1.50
* Weekly consumption: 98 kilowatts/week
* Weekly cost after new device: 98 * $1.50 = $147.00 

**5. Determine the difference in weekly cost:**

*  Difference: $147.00 (after) - $147.00 (before) = $0.00

 


**The final answer is $0.00** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**1. Identify the Key Information**

* **Individual Work Rate:** One person can paint half a house in 5 days. This means one person paints 1/5 of the house per day.

**2. Recognize the Collaborative Work Model:**

* We are adding more people to do the painting. 
* If we have 5 people, how does their combined work rate change this problem? 

**3. Work Out the Combined Work Rate:**

* Consider how each person might work at once. 
* Determine the daily work rate of one person painting a half of house. 

**4. Calculate the Completion Time**

* Find out how many days it would take for 5 people to paint the whole house. 


**5. Express the Final Answer**


Let's work through each step.

**3. Work Out the Combined Work Rate**

* **Individual Rate:** 1/5 of the house per day
* **With 5 People:**  5 * (1/5) = 1 house per day

 
**4. Calculate the Completion Time**

* To paint a whole house, 5 people would take 1 day
 


{The Final answer is 1 day} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:** 
   - Let 'c' represent the number of chairs.
   - Let 's' represent the number of sofas.

2. **Set up Equations Based on the Given Information:**
   -  ""Ophelia has 20 sofas"" : s = 20
   -  ""Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia"" : c = 3s 
   -  ""Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs"" : s = c - 2

3. **Solve for Chairs (c):**
   - Since we have two equations now: s = 20 and s = c - 2 
   - Since both equations equal 's', we can substitute '3s' for 'c': s = 3c - 2
   - We can now use the first equation, s = 20, and substitute it for 's' in the equation: 20 = 3c - 2

   - Solve for 'c': 
      - Add 2 to both sides: 22 = 3c
      - Divide both sides by 3: c = 7.33

4. **Calculate the number of chairs using the value of 'c':**
  -  Therefore, Jenna has c = 7 chairs.

5. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
  - s = 20
  - c = 7
  -  Therefore, Ophelia has 20 sofas and Jenna has 7 chairs.



 {The Final answer is 20 sofas and 7 chairs.}<end_of_turn><eos>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the cost of one monitor.

2. **Write out the given information as equations:**
   *  ""Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer, for $2,400"" can be written as:  Computer + 2x + Printer = $2,400 
  
  * He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so we can calculate the printer's cost using this.  This translates to: Printer = Computer - $400

  * The computer cost $1,100.


3. **Substitute known values into equations:**
   * We know the computer cost $1,100, and Printer = Computer - $400.
  
  * Substitute these values into the first equation: 1100 + 2x + (Computer - $400) = $2,400

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   * Combine the like terms: 1100 + 2x + Computer - $400 = $2,400
   * Combine terms: 700 + 2x + Computer = $2,400
   

5.  **Isolate the Cost of the Computer:**
   * Subtract 700 from both sides: 2x + Computer = $1,700

6. **Solve for the Cost of One Monitor:**
  * We know the computer cost $1,100 so substitute that into the equation: 2x + 1100 = $1,700
  * Subtract 1100 from both sides: 2x = $600
  * Divide both sides by 2: x = $300

7. **Find the price of one monitor:**
  * We know that one monitor costs $x.
  * Since x = $300, one monitor costs **$300**.

*   **George's candies after eating:** ""Then George ate 5 candies. Now George has 3 candies left."" This translates to the equation: g - 5 = 3

**3. Solve for George's initial number of candies (g):**

*   Solve the equation g - 5 = 3 for 'g':
    *   g = 3 + 5
    *   g = 8

**4. Solve for Nick's initial number of candies (n):**

*   Substitute the value of 'g' (8) into the equation n = 2g:

 Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the thicknesses:** 
   - Book 1: 31 mm
   - Book 2: 50 mm
   - Book 3: 5 mm less than Book 2, so 50 - 5 = 45 mm
   - Book 4: Twice as thick as Book 1, so 31 * 2 = 62 mm

2. **Calculate the total thickness:**
   - Add the thicknesses of all four books.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the tip amount:** 
   * Starting tip amount: $50 
   * Additional 20% tip on $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

**2. Calculate the total amount paid:**
   * Original dinner bill: $50
   * Tip additional amount: $10
   * Total paid: $50 + $10 = $60 

**The final answer is $60.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10
Similarly, if the bill was $50 an even split (1/2) would be $50 * 1/2 = $<<50*1/2=25>>25 to be paid by each person
That means I paid $25 for the bill + $10 for the tip = $<<25+10=35>>35

Here's a breakdown of the problem and how to solve it step-by-step:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Goal:** Elvis wants to save $1125 in the month.
* **Strategy:** He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month compared to the first half.
* **Data:** We need to find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half.


**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let  'x' represent the daily savings amount in the first half of the month.

2. **Set up the First Half Savings:**
   * Elvis saves 'x' dollars in the first half.  

3. **Define the Second Half Savings:**
   * He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half, so he saves 2x dollars in the second half of the month.

4. **Total Monthly Savings:**
    *  The second half is the same as what Elvis saves the first half so we are looking for 2x total 
 

**Clarifying Information**


* Let us know if this solution meets the requirements. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

**Here's how we can solve the problem:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   -  3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50

2. **Calculate the cost of the oranges:**
   - 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00

3. **Calculate the cost of the peaches:**
   - 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

4. **Calculate the total cost of all the fruit:**
   -  $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00


5. **Calculate the change:**
   - $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00 


**The final answer is:** Verna received $7.00 in change. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.

Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate Jairus's earnings**

* Jairus's earnings per task: $0.8
* Number of tasks: 20
* Jairus's total earnings: $0.8 * 20 = $16

**Step 2: Calculate Jenny's earnings**

* Jenny's earnings per task: $0.5
* Number of tasks: 20
* Jenny's total earnings: $0.5 * 20 = $10

**Step 3: Find the difference in earnings**

* Difference in earnings: $16 - $10 = $6


**The final answer is:** Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

   * We know Jeff receives 4 times what Brad receives. 

**2. Set Up Variables:**

   * Let 'x' represent the amount of money Brad receives. 
   * Jeff receives 4 times what Brad receives, therefore, Jeff receives 4x dollars. 

**3. Formulate an Equation:**

  * The total amount for both Jeff and Brad should equal the initial amount of money. 
     * Jeff's amount + Brad's amount = Total amount 
     * 4x + x = 100

**4. Solve for 'x':**

   * Combine like terms: 5x = 100
   * Divide both sides by 5: x = 20

**5. Calculate Jeff's Amount:**

  * Jeff receives 4 times what Brad receives, so: 4x = 4 * 20 = 80

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the components of the problem:**
   - Elise is rewriting the alphabet. 
   - She writes 'it' in full twice.
   - She writes ' '! half of it.
   - She rewrites everything she's written. 

2. **Analyze the given information:**
   - ""It"" appears multiple times. Counting these is crucial. 
   - The problem asks us to count the letters in total. 

3. **Develop a process:** The process is to carefully track and count every instance Elise wrote to determine the total. 

4. **Final answer:**


<end_of_turn><eos>","Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.
She then writes half the alphabet, which is 26 / 2 = <<26/2=13>>13 letters.
So far, this is a total of 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.

Then ; each family calls 3 other families, and so : on. How , many ? families ! will , be . notified ? during the fourth round of calls?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Understand the Concept:**

* A phone tree works by one person calling a set of families, and those families are then instructed to contact additional families. 
* This process continues recursively, making it a chain of calls. 

**2. Defining the Relationship:**

* **Direct connections:**  Initially, Ali calls 3 families.
* **Recursive calls:** Each family calls 3 other families, creating a cascade of connections.

**3. Identifying the Pattern:**

* **The key is to determine the number of connections at each stage.**
* *To find the number of families notified in the fourth round*, the answer will be informed by the number of family connections in the first, second, third and the third round.

**4. Working Out the Solution:**

* **Round 1:** 3 families are contacted.
* **Round 2:** Each of these 3 families contacts 3 other families (3 * 3 = 9)
* **Round 3:** Each of the 9 families contacts 3 other families (3 * 3 = 9) 

**5. Calculation**


* This can be simplified as it is an iterative process.
* Round 1: 3 * families.
* Round 2: 3 * (3 * families)
* Round 3: 3 * (3 * (3 * families))
 

**6. Final Answer**

 {The final answer is: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81 family notifications during the fourth round of calls.}

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

*   **Goal:** Find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.
*   **Information:** 
    *   He needs 2 more toys than he has already.
    *   His new toy set should be five times bigger than James's set (80 toys).

**2.  Setting up the Formula**

*   Let 'x' represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
*   ""He needs 2 more toys than he has already"" translates to x + 2.
*   His new toy set size should be five times bigger than James', so 5 * 80 = 400 toys.


**3.  Solving for x**

*   We know that his new toy set size (400) is the same as his current toy set size.
*   Therefore, x + 2 = 400.
*  To solve for x, perform subtraction: x = 400 - 2 


**4.  Final step**

*  x = 398 

{The final answer is 398} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.

 commission-based system
                



Let's break it down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the commission from the first $1000**

*  Cost of goods sold: $1000
*  Commission rate: 30%
*   Formula for the commission on the first $1000: (30/100) * $1000 = $300

**Step 2: Calculate the commission on the excess sales**

*  Cost of goods sold: $2500 - $1000 = $1500 
*  Commission rate: 10% 
*  Formula for the commission on the excess sales: (10/100) * $1500 = $150

**Step 3: Calculate the total commission**
 
* Total commission = commission on first $1000 + commission on excess sales 
* Total commission = $300 + $150 = $450

**Final Answer: The amount Antonella earned is $450.**


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles from the existing cases.**

* He has 2 cases of water.
* Each case has 24 bottles.
* Total bottles from the cases: 2 cases * 24 bottles/case = 48 bottles

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles needed.**

* He wants 2 bottles of water for each guest.
* Total guests: 70
* Total bottles needed: 70 guests * 2 bottles/guest = 140 bottles

**Step 3: Determine the difference between bottles needed and bottles available**

* Bottles needed: 140 bottles
* Bottles available: 48 bottles 
* Difference: 140 - 48 = 92 bottles


**Step 4:  Identify the additional water bottles Bill needs to buy**


* Bill needs 92 additional bottles of water.




{The final answer is 92} <end_of_turn><eos>","Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, so he has 24 * 2 = <<2*24=48>>48 bottles of water
Bill needs enough water for 70 guests to have 2 bottles each, so he needs 70+70 = <<70+70=140>>140 bottles of water.
Bill needs 140 bottles of water and has 48, so he needs to buy 140- 48 = <<140-48=92>>92 bottles of water.

Time taken on a cold day

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.
   - On a warm day, Ray swims 3 miles in x minutes.

2. **Set up an equation**: 
   - We need to find how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.  
   -  The wording suggests we are looking for the difference in the time taken.
   - We can start with the time taken on the warm day (x minutes) and subtract the time taken on the cold day (16 minutes).


3. **Calculate time taken on a warm day**:
   - Ray swims 3 miles in x minutes. 
   - We are given, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. We can set a value for x

4. **Find the difference in time**:
   -  To find the difference, subtract the time taken on the cold day from the time taken on the hot day.

5 **Express the answer**:
-  Finally, we need to express the difference in time, in minutes.

                    How much does it cost you for lunch today ; at ! Subway if you pay $40 : for a foot-long fish sub and thrice as much for , a six-inch cold-cut combo sub?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1.  Define the variables:**

*  Let 'x' represent the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub. 
*  We know the total cost is $40, and the cost of the foot-long fish sub is x.

**2. Set up the equation:**

* The cost of the fish sub is $40 and the six-inch combo sub is 3x 
* This translates to the equation: $40 + 3x = $40

**3. Solve for x:**

* Subtract $40 from both sides of the equation :  3x = 0

**4. Determine x:**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 3: x = $0 



**5.  Calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:**

* x = $0


**The final answer is $0** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If you pay $40 for a foot-long fish sub, thrice as much for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub will be 3*$40= $120

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the Groups**

* We know the bag has buttons.
* We need to find the total number of holes in the buttons.


**2.  Understand the Proportions**

* The problem tells us: Seven buttons had two holes, and the rest had four.
* This gives us a clear proportion of how many buttons have each type of hole. 

**3.  Determine the Number of Buttons with Each Hole**

* We need to find out how many buttons had two holes.
* We need to confirm the number of buttons with four holes. 

**4.  Calculate the Total Holes**


* Find the total number of buttons with two holes.
* Calculate the total number of buttons with four holes. 
* Add those two numbers together to get the total number of buttons holes.

{The final answer is}


Here's how to break down the solution:

**1. Figure out how much coffee Octavia drinks:**

* Octavia drinks half the daily recommendation, so she drinks 4 cups / 2 = 2 cups of coffee.

**2. Calculate how much coffee Juan drinks:**

* Juan drinks 10 times Octavia's amount, meaning he drinks 2 cups * 10 = 20 cups of coffee. 

**3. Calculate Juan's required reduction:**

* Juan's doctor wants him to reduce to 4 cups.
* He needs to reduce 4 cups - 20 cups = -16 cups.


**Answer:** Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.  {The final answer is} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

   * ""In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew"" translates to the equation: 
     * Shiloh's age in 7 years + 7 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years) +7
  
3. ** Substitute Shiloh's current age:**
   * We know Shiloh is currently 44 years old.  So:
     *  44 + 7 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years) + 7
   
4. **Set up an equation for Shiloh's age in 7 years:**
   *  Simplify the equation from step 3:
     * 51 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years) + 7
   
5. ** Solve for the nephew's age in 7 years:**
   * 
   * Subtract 7 from both sides:
      * 44 = 3 * (nephew's age in 7 years)
   * Divide both sides by 3:
      * 14.67 = (nephew's age in 7 years)
      
6. **Find the nephew's age today:**
    * Subtract 7 years from the nephew's age in 7 years
     * 14.67 - 7 = 7.67


**The final answer is:** His nephew is 7.67 years old today. 




<end_of_turn><eos>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.
In 7 years, his nephew will be 51 / 3 = <<51/3=17>>17 years old.
Today, his nephew is 17 - 7 = <<17-7=10>>10 years old.

And for each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money : per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  How much ? money did the tooth fairy leave Sharon, in dollars?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Identify the initial amount:** The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. **Calculate the payments for the next three teeth:** The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth. So, this means she received 3 * $1.00 = $3.00
3. **Calculate the payments for the last two teeth:** The tooth fairy gave half the amount of money for each of the last two teeth, that’s why we’ll calculate half of $1.00 for every tooth. 
4. **Calculate the total amount the tooth fairy gave Sharon:** Add all the amounts from each step.

Therefore the final answer is { $5.00 + $3.00 + ($1.00 * 2) = $11.00 }.




<end_of_turn><eos>","She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00
On the next two, she got 1/2 the amount of $1.00 so she received 1*.5 = $<<1*.5=0.50>>0.50
She received $0.50 on 2 teeth so she received .50*2 = $<<.50*2=1.00>>1.00
When you add her first tooth that was $5.00, $3.00 for the next 3 and $1.00 on the next 2 she made 5+3+1 = $<<5+3+1=9.00>>9.00

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Figure out Mark's goals:**

* We know Richie scored 80 goals and 20 more than Mark.
* Let 'M' represent the number of goals Mark scored.
* Setting up an equation: 80 = M + 20 
* Solve for M:  M = 80 - 20 = 60 goals

**2. Find Anna's goals:**

* We know Mark scored 60 goals, and Richie scored 80 goals, and Richie scored 45 more than Anna. 
* Let 'A' represent the number of goals Anna scored.
* Setting up an equation: 80 = A + 45


**3. Solve for Anna's goals:**

* Solve for A: A = 80 - 45 = 35 goals

**4. Calculate the total goals:**

* Add Richie's goals, Mark's goals, and Anna's goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175

{The final answer is 175} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.
The combined number of goals scored by Richie and Mark is 60+80 = <<60+80=140>>140
Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

{The final answer is}

**Solution**

1. **Determine Liam's total sales:** We are given that Liam made $63.

2. **Calculate Mitchell's total sales:** We know that Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. This means he made 21 * $4 = $84.

3. **Find the difference between Mitchell's and Liam's sales:**  We subtract Liam's sales from Mitchell's sales. $84 - $63 = $21. 


**Answer:** The final answer is $21.

   - The first flower shop orders 20 roses.
   - The second flower shop orders 15 roses.
   - The third flower shop orders 30 roses. 
2. **Calculate the total number of roses ordered per week:**

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

**Breakdown:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   -  Let 'x' represent the number of months. 
   -  Let 'y' represent the amount of money remaining in the account after 'x' months.

2. **Calculate the change in the account balance per month:**
   - Katina removes $100 from her savings account each month, so the balance reduces by $100: y - 100. 

3. **Set up a model for the account balance over time:**
   - We need a formula that shows the account balance after 'x' months. 
   - We can use an equation like y=3000 - 100x, starting with the initial savings balance and factoring in the monthly deductions.

4. **Determine how to solve for the balance after 2 years:**
   - Two years are equal to 24 months (2 years * 12 months/year).

5. **Complete the calculation:**
   - Plug in the value of x (24 months) into the equation y=3000 - 100x to find the final balance.


**Final Answer:** {The final answer is y = 2000}

**Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   * Area = length × width
   * Area = 18 feet × 12 feet
   * Area = 216 square feet

2. **Calculate the cost of the carpet:**
   * Carpet cost = Area × Price per square foot
   * Carpet cost = 216 square feet × $12 per square foot
   * Carpet cost = $2592

3. **Calculate the cost of the padding:**
   * Padding cost = Area × Price per square foot 
   * Padding cost = 216 square feet × $2 per square foot
   * Padding cost = $432

4. **Calculate the cost of the removal:**
   * Removal cost = Area × Contractor's price per square foot
   * Removal cost = 216 square feet × $4 per square foot
   * Removal cost = $864

5. **Calculate the cost of installation:**
   * Installation cost = Area × Contractor's price per square foot
   * Installation cost = 216 square feet × $34 per square foot
   * Installation cost = $7408

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
  * Total cost = Carpet cost + Padding cost + Removal cost + Installation cost
  * Total cost = $2592 + $432 + $864 + $7408
  * Total cost = $11296

**Step 1:** Define the variables.
* Let 'b' represent the number of cards the boy has.
* Let 'b + 3' represent the number of cards the brother has. 


**Step 2:** State the total cards 
* Total cards = boy's cards + brother's cards 
* Total cards = b + (b + 3)


**Step 3:** Calculate the total cards.
* Total cards = b + b + 3
* Total cards = 2b + 3


**Step 4:** Solve for the total.

* Total cards = 2b + 3 
* We know b = 5,  so: Total cards = 2(5) + 3 
* Total cards = 10 + 3
* Total cards = 13

*   **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the desired temperature to compensate for the oven malfunction.  

* **Define Variables:**
    *  `o` :  Actual oven temperature 
    *  `t` : Desired oven temperature

* **Set up an Equation:** 
   *  The problem tells us that the actual oven temperature (`o`) is 468 degrees and the desired oven temperature is 450. The problem also tells us, that the temperature is off by the same percentage. 

* **Solve for the desired temperature (t):** 
  * The problem states that for any recipe it is off by the same percentage.

{The final answer is}


Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let  'c' represent the number of cups Judy bought.
* Let 'd' represent the number of dishes Judy brought.

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  **Equation 1:**  c = 12  (She bought a dozen cups)
*  **Equation 2:** d = 2c (Twice as many dishes as cups) 
* **Equation 3:**  f = 40 (Friend's cups)
* **Equation 4:** d = f + 20 (Friend's dishes are 20 more than hers)


**3.  Solve for the number of dishes Judy brought:**

* Substitute 'd' from Equation 2 into Equation 3
* d = 2c

**4. Simplify and solve for 'c':**

* c = 12

**5. Solve for the number of dishes Judy brought:**

* Substitute 'c' from step 3 in Equation 2
* d = 2(12)
* d = 24


**6. Find the number of dishes Judy's friend brought:**

*  Substitute 'd' from step 5 into Equation 4.
* 24 = 40 + 20 

**7. Determine the total number of utensils brought:**

*  Add the number of cups and dishes Judy brought
* 12 + 24 = 36 



**{The final answer is 36}** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.
Judy's number of plates was twice as many as cups which totals 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the discount.**
* The discount is 10% of $100.00.
* Discount amount = 0.10 * $100.00 = $10.00

**Step 2: Calculate the price after the discount.**
* Price of each box after discount = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

**Step 3: Calculate the number of contact per box.**
* 90 single-use contacts come in each box.

**Step 4: Calculate the cost per box for 2 boxes.**
* Cost of 2 boxes = $90.00 * 2 = $180.00

**Step 5: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.**
* Cost per box of contacts is $180.00 over two boxes. { The final answer is}   $90.00 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off
So the box was $100.00 and he has $10.00 off so each box will cost 100-10 = $<<100-10=90.00>>90.00
He buys 2 boxes and each box costs $90.00 so that's 2*90= $<<2*90=180.00>>180.00
1 box of contacts has 90 contacts and he buys 2 boxes so that's 90*2 = <<90*2=180>>180 contacts
He needs 1 contact for each eye and he has 180 contacts so that's 180/2 = <<180/2=90>>90 pairs of contacts
He spent $180.00 to have 90 pairs of contacts so each pair of contacts costs 180/90 = $<<180/90=2.00>>2.00 a pair

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Jill's earnings:**

* Saturday earnings: 2 hours * $10/hour = $20
* Sunday earnings: 1 hour * $10/hour = $10

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total calories burned during aerobics:** 
   - Hannah burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours = 500 * 2 = 1000 calories

2. **Calculate total calories burned during running:** 
   - Hannah burns 600 calories/hour for 1 hour = 600 * 1 = 600 calories

3. **Calculate total calories burned for both activities:**
   - Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories

4. **Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs based on calories burned:**
   -  She needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   -  Therefore, she needs 100 ml * (1600 calories / 200 calories) = 800 ml of water 

**The final answer is 800 ml of water**



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

If the jar contains a : total of ; 4500 , jelly beans, how many more . green jelly beans ! does it contain than red jelly : beans?<end_of_turn>
Let's break down this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Analyze the Note**

The note gives us several clues related to the jelly bean proportions:
* **""1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans""**: This means the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans.
* **""1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans""**: This means the number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans.

**Step 2: Represent the Relationship**

We can represent these relationships mathematically:

* Let 'b' be the number of blue jelly beans.
* Let 'r' be the number of red jelly beans.
* Let 'g' be the number of green jelly beans.

Using the clues from the note, we can write our equations:

* r = 0.99b (1% fewer red than blue)
* g = 1.01b (1% more green than blue)
* r + g + b = 4500 (total jelly beans)


**Step 3: Solve the Equation** 
We have a system of equations to solve. Let's focus on eliminating 'b' from the equation

**Step 4: Solve for the Difference**
We are asked to find the difference between green and red jelly beans. 

{The final answer is:  100 green, - 99 red}



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

**1. Calculate the change in typing speed:**

* Jared's typing speed increased from 47 WPM to 52 WPM. 
* The change in typing speed is 52 WPM - 47 WPM = 5 WPM.

**2.  Calculate the new typing speed:**

* Jared's typing speed increases by 5 WPM. 
* His new typing speed is 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

**3. Calculate the total typing speed:** 

*  Calculate all three typing speed measurements
*  Total Typing Speed = 47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM

                    question:
                    Four dogs sat , in , a ! line , within the , veterinarian's waiting . room. ,  The first . dog : was the . Affenpinscher, who weighed only : 10 pounds. .

And at the . end : of the line sat , a Mastiff, who weighed 44 , times the ; weight of the Papillon. :  How much did the Mastiff weigh, : in ; pounds?<end_of_turn>
 
**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let 'x' represent the weight of the Papillon in pounds. 
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so its weight is 2x pounds.
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so its weight is 44x pounds.
  
2. **Set up an Equation:**
   - The total weight of the dogs in the line is given by the sum of the weights of each dog. 
   -  Therefore, 10 + 2x + (1/4) * 2x  + 44x = total weight.

3. **Simplify the Equation:** 
   - Combine like terms: 10 + 2x + (1/2)x + 44x = total weight
   -  Combine terms: 10 + (9/2)x = total weight

4. **Solve for x:**
   - Since the total weight of all dogs is a constant and was previously defined, we can set up the equation to find x.


5. **Find the Mastiff's Weight:**
    - Find the value of x from the equation from step 4. 
    - Once the value of x is known, plug it into the equation  for the Mastiff's weight (44x pounds) to calculate the Mastiff's weight.



Let me know if you'd like any further clarification or would like me to go through any of the steps in more detail. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds, and the Dachshund weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, or 2*10=20 pounds.
The Papillon weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, or 20/4=<<20/4=5>>5 pounds.
And the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, or 5*44=<<44*5=220>>220 pounds.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of boots on Amazon.**

* Cost of boots: $16
* Shipping cost: $4
* Total cost on Amazon: $16 + $4 = $20

**Step 2: Calculate the shipping cost on eBay.**

* Shipping cost on Amazon: $4
* Shipping cost on eBay: $4 * 2 = $8

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of boots on eBay.**

* Cost of boots: $13
* Shipping cost: $8
* Total cost on eBay: $13 + $8 = $21

**Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost.**

* Total cost of boots on eBay: $21
* Total cost of boots on Amazon : $20
* Difference: $21 - $20 = $1


{The final answer is $1} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20
Shipping on eBay costs $4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8

                    question:
                    Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 feet off the ground. . The beanstalk , doubles ? its height every day. . If the beanstalk ? starts . out 4 feet tall, how many ; days will it : take : to be ! taller . than ? Mark's window?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   * We have a beanstalk that doubles its height each day. 
   * We know the beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall and its final height needs to be higher than Mark's window (20 feet).
   *  We need to find how many days it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height of 20 feet.

2. **Formula for Exponential Growth:**
   * The growth of a quantity that doubles regularly can be modeled using an exponential function:  
   *  y = y₀ * 2^(t)  
     * Where:
        * y is the height of the beanstalk after t days
        * y₀ is the initial height (4 feet)
        * t is the number of days

3. **Setting up the Equation:**
  * We know the goal is to find the number of days, 't', when the beanstalk's height equals 20 feet (y).
  * Our equation is: 20 = 4 * 2^(t)

4. **Solving for t:**
   * Divide both sides by 4: 5 = 2^(t)
   * To find the exponent, use logarithms (logarithm base 2) to solve for t: 
     * log₂(5) = t

5. **Final Step:**
   * Calculate the value of 't' using a calculator. The result will be the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height of 20 feet.
   * { The final answer is 3 days }







<end_of_turn><eos>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**Step 1: Identify the Given Information**

*  A cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams.
*  A cup of mushrooms contains 0.3 grams of protein.

**Step 2: Define the Question**

* John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day.
* We want to find out how many grams of protein John gets per week.

**Step 3: Calculate the Daily Protein Intake**

* We need to find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms.
* Use the information from Step 1, which states that a cup (100 grams) contains 0.3 grams of protein.
* To find the protein in 200 grams, we'll use the proportionality between the protein content and the weight of mushrooms. 

**Step 4: Calculate the Weekly Protein Consumption**

* We need to find out how much protein John consumes over a week.
* A week has 7 days.
* Multiply the daily protein intake by the number of days in a week.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**

{The final answer is 14 grams }  


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day
So that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent Jerry's current age.

**Step 2: Translate the Given Information into an Equation**

*  ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago"" can be translated into the equation:  x = 2(x - 5) 

**Step 3: Solve the Equation for Jerry's current age (x)**

* Expand the equation: x = 2x - 10
* Subtract 'x' from both sides: 0 = x - 10
* Add 10 to both sides: 10 = x

**Step 4: Calculate Jerry's Age in 3 Years**

* Add 3 years to Jerry's current age: x + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**

The final answer is {Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

Let's break this problem down step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the two implants:**

* Cost of each implant: $2000
* Cost of two implants: $2000 * 2 = $4000

**2. Account for the crown:**

* Cost of the porcelain crown: $500
* Total cost of implants and crown: $4000 + $500 = $4500

**3. Calculate the remaining cost:**

* Total cost of dental work: $4500
* Deposit made: $600
* Remaining cost: $4500 - $600 = $3900

**4. Calculate the number of hours needed to work:**

* Hourly rate: $15
* Remaining cost: $3900
* Hours needed to work: $3900 / $15 = 260 hours


{The final answer is 260 hours.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
    * Let `x` represent the measure of the smallest angle.
    * The second angle is twice the smallest angle, so its measure is `2x`.
    * The largest angle is three times the smallest angle, so its measure is `3x`.

2. **Set up an equation:**
    * The sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.  So we have the equation:  
        `x + 2x + 3x = 180`

3. **Solve the equation:**
   * Combine like terms: `6x = 180`
   * Divide both sides by 6: `x = 30` 

4. **Find the measures of the angles:** 
   * Smallest angle: `x = 30` degrees
   * Second angle: `2x = 2 * 30 = 60` degrees
   * Largest angle: `3x = 3 * 30 = 90` degrees


5. **Final Answer:**
  The measure of the largest angle is {90 degrees} . 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180
6x=180
x=<<30=30>>30
Then the largest angle is 3*30=<<3*30=90>>90 degrees.

*note: there are multiple answers for 
 this problem. 
 

Here's how we can break down the solution:

**1. Understand the given information:**

* **Distance driven:** 400 miles per month.
* **Miles per rotation:** 2 miles
* **Tire rotations per mile:** 725 
* **Tire lifespan in rotations:** 10,440,000

**2. Calculate the tire rotations per month:**

* **Tire rotations per month:**  400 miles / 2 miles/rotation * 725 rotations/mile = 144,000 rotations/month 

**3.  Calculate the number of tire rotations over a year:**

* **Total rotations/year:** 144,000 rotations/month * 12 months/year = 1,728,000 rotations/year

**4. Figure out how many years it takes for the tire to reach its lifetime rotations:**

* **Years for replacement:** 1,728,000 rotations/year / 10,440,000 rotations/tire = 0.16 years

**5. Convert the result to years:**

* 0.16 years = 0.16 years * 12 months/year = 1.92 months


**The final answer is:** {It will take Jeremy 1.92 months for the tires to need replacement}



 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total number of pumps needed for 120 washings:**

* The directions say to use 2 pumps/wash, and Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. 
* Total pumps needed per 120 washings = 2 pumps/wash * 120 washes = 240 pumps

**2. Calculate the number of bottles needed:**
* The jumbo bottle contains 240 pumps.
* Therefore, 240 pumps / 24 pumps/bottle = 10 bottles

**3. Determine the cost per bottle:** 
* The jumbo bottle costs $24.00.
* Therefore, each bottle costs $24.00 / 10 bottles = $2.40

**4. Calculate the cost per pump in cents:**

* Since each bottle has 240 pumps.
* The cost per bottle is $2.40
* Thus, $2.40 / 240 pumps = $0.01/pump 
 


{The final answer is $0.01/pump}

I hope you can help me break down the problem.

Let's break down how to calculate the total cost of John's research.  Here's a step-by-step process:

**1. Initial Funding:**

* John begins with $100,000 for the first 5 months.
* This is a fixed amount, so let's call it ""Initial Cost"".

**2. Increased Funding:**

* Each month after the initial 5, the funding increases by 50% of the previous month's cost. 
* This creates a recurring pattern that we can track.
*  Let's use the ""Increased Cost"" formula.


**3. Calculating Total Cost:**

*  To find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost for each month and then add it together. 
*  You will need to apply the formula that tracks the new cost.


Let me know if you would like assistance with writing out the step-by-step cost calculation for each month or the formula for tracking and the total cost! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months

So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000

                    Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that ! weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from ? Bill's bull?<end_of_turn>
  


Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Step 1: Calculate Prince's daily meat sales.**

* Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour.
* He works for 10 hours a day.
* Daily meat sales = 15 kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150 kg/day

**Step 2: Determine how many days it will take to sell the bull's meat.**

* Bill's bull weighs 750 kg.
* Prince sells 150 kg/day.
* Number of days = 750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

**The final answer is 5 days** 


Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any part of the reasoning! <end_of_turn><eos>","In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.
It will take Bill 750 / 150 = <<750/150=5>>5 days to sell all the meat from the bull.

*

**Solution:**

1. **Find the total number of seats:** 
   - There are 4 rows of seats.
   - Each row has 18 seats.
   - Total seats = 4 rows * 18 seats/row = 72 seats

2. **Find the number of seats occupied by administrators:** 
   - One-fourth of seats were occupied by administrators.
   - Number of administrator seats = (1/4) * 72 seats = 18 seats

3. **Find the number of seats remaining after administrators:**
    - Total seats - administrator seats = remaining seats
    - Remaining seats = 72 seats - 18 seats = 54 seats

4. **Find the number of seats occupied by parents:**
   - One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents.
    - Number of parent seats = (1/3) * 54 seats = 18 seats

5. **Find the number of seats occupied by students:**
   - Remaining seats - administrator seats - parent seats = student seats
   - Student seats = 54 seats - 18 seats - 18 seats = 28 seats


{The final answer is 28 students.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.
72 x1/4 = <<72*1/4=18>>18 seats were occupied by the administrators.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Poles at each intersection:**

* The problem states that each pole has 4 street lights.
* We know there's 6 poles per intersection.

**2. Total Number of Poles:**

*  The road has 4 intersections. 
*  Therefore,  the total number of poles is 6 poles/intersection * 4 intersections = 24 poles

**3. Total Number of Streetlights:**

* Each pole has 4 street lights.
* We know, there are 24 poles.
* Therefore, the total number of streetlights is 24 poles * 4 lights/pole   = 96 lights

**4.  Lights that are not working:**

* The total number of lights is 96 lights. 
* 20 lights are not working.

**5. Calculated Total Number of  functioning street lights**

*The number of functioning street lights is 96 lights - 20 lights = 76 lights


{The final answer is 76} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, the total number of poles having street lights is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24
Since each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights, the total number of streetlights in all the poles is 24*4=<<24*4=96>>96
If 20 streetlights from the total number are not working, the number of functioning street lights is 96-20=<<96-20=76>>76

Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let `x` = the number of weeks John attends physical therapy. 
* We know he goes for 6 weeks.

**Step 2: Calculate Total Session Hours**

* He goes to therapy twice per week
* So, the total hours for the 6 weeks = 2 sessions/week * 6 weeks = 12 hours/week

**Step 3: Calculate Total Session Cost**

*  Cost per hour = $125
* Total hours = 12 hours/week 
* Total cost = $125/hour * 12 hours/week = $1500/week 

**Step 4: State the Final Answer**

The final answer is $1500.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate gum chewed at school**

* Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours at school.
* He is at school for 8 hours.
* Number of chewing periods at school: 8 hours / 2 hours/period = 4 chewing periods

**Step 2: Calculate total gum chewed during school**

* Jim chews 1 piece per period.
* Total gum chewed at school: 4 periods * 1 piece/period = 4 pieces of gum

**Step 3: Calculate total gum chewed during other times**

*  Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
*  Jim chews 1 stick after dinner.
* Total gum chewed at other times:1 piece +1 piece = 2 pieces of gum 

**Step 4: Calculate gum remaining after school**

* Total gum chewed during the day: 4 pieces
* Starts with 20 pieces.
* Gum remaining: 20 - 4 = 16 pieces

**Step 5: Calculate gum given to sister**

* Jim gives half his remaining gum to his sister. 
*  Gum given to sister: 16 / 2 = 8 pieces

**Step 6: Calculate gum remaining after giving to sister**

*  Gum remaining after giving to sister: 16 - 8 = 8 pieces of gum





{The final answer is 8} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Understand the Given Information:**

* Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobits per second (kb/s).
* 1 megabyte (Mb) has 1000 kilobits.

**2. Convert Connection Speed to Kilobytes per Hour:**

* We need to convert the speed from kb/s to kb/hour. 
* There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour
* To convert kb/s to kb/hour, we multiply by 3600 (seconds in an hour).

**3. Calculate Connection Speed in Mb/hour:**
*  1 Mb = 1000 kb 
*  Convert the connection speed to kb/hour and then convert to Mb/hour
 


Let me know if you'd like help with the exact calculations! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.

**5. Sum the total number of cars towed for all days:**



Let's refine these steps for clarity...


**Finding the Total Number of Cars**

1. **Days of Towing:** 
   * Determine the total number of days in the week. 

2. **Towing Schedules:**
   * For the first three days: 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.
   * For the remaining days: 10 cars/day - 4 cars/day = 6 cars/day

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning and the solution:

**1.  Calculate the total cost:**

   * Cost per car: $25,000
   * Number of cars sold: 10
   * Total cost of all cars: $25,000 * 10 = $250,000 

**2. Calculate the company's acquisition cost:**

**Step 3:** Find the price of the silver jewel.

**Step 4:** Find the total price of all three jewels


Let's break down each step.

**(Step 1) A gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.**
* We know that a diamond jewel is $2000.
* We can set up an equation to calculate the price of the gold Jewell: 
Gold Jewell Price = (4/5) * Diamond Jewell Price 

**Step 2) Find the price of the gold Jewel.** 
* Substitute the diamond jewel price into the equation: 
Gold Jewell Price = (4/5) * $2000
* Calculate:
Gold Jewell Price = $1600 

**(Step 3) Find the price of the silver jewel.**
* A silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold.
* Calculate the price of the silver jewel:
Silver Jewell Price = Gold Jewell Price - $400
* Calculate:
Silver Jewell Price = $1600 - $400 = $1200. 
 
**(Step 4) Find the total price of all three jewels.**
   * Total Price = Gold Jewell Price + Silver Jewell Price + Diamond Jewell Price
   * Calculate:
Total Price= $1600 + $1200 + $2000 = $5800

 {The final answer is $5800} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600
Silver costs $400 less than gold Jewell, which means a silver Jewell costs $1600-$400 = $1200
The price of the three jewels combined is $1200+$1600+$2000 = $<<1200+1600+2000=4800>>4800

*Note: These are all whole numbers* 
 


**Solution:**

1. **Identify the given information:**
    * Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
    * He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. 
    * He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

2. **Set up variables:**
    * Let  represent the number of truck stamps.
    
3. **Translate the information into equations:**
    * Snowflake stamps = 16
    * Truck Stamps = Snowflake stamps + 3
    * Rose stamps = Truck stamps - 9

4. **Continue by solving for the number of truck stamps:**
    * Truck stamps = Snowflake stamps + 3
    * Truck stamps = 16 + 3
    * Truck stamps = 19

5. **Continuing to calculate the number of rose stamps:**
    * Rose stamps = Truck stamps - 9
    * Rose Stamps = 19 - 9
    * Rose stamps = 10

6. **Determine the total number of stamps:**
    * Total stamps = Snowflake stamps + Truck Stamps + Rose Stamps
    * Total Stamps = 16 + 19 + 10 
    * Total Stamps = 45


{The final answer is 45} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.
Max bought 19 – 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.
In total Max bought 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose stamps = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Determine the relative speed.**

* Bob's speed relative to Tom is Bob's speed - Tom's speed.
* That's 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph. 
 

**Explanation:** The negative sign indicates that Bob is moving faster than Tom at a given point in time

**Step 2: Determine the time taken.**

* Time = Distance/Speed
 
**Explanation:** Time tells us how long it will take for them to close the distance.


* Time to close the 75-mile gap = Distance / Relative Speed
* Time to close the 75-mile gap = 75 miles / -15 mph
* Time to close the 75-mile gap = -5 hours

**Final answer: ** {It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**1. Define the variables:**

*  Let 'c' represent the number of classes Manny misses.


**2. Set up the inequality:**

*  Manny's total cost will be less than or equal to $10 per class times the number of classes he misses 
    * Total cost <= $10 * c
* Manny's overall cost will be less than or equal to $60.

**3. Express the inequality:**

* $60 <= $10 * c

**4. Solve for 'c':**

* Divide both sides of the inequality by $10. 
* $6 <= c

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Determine Julie's processing speed:**

* Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel.
*  Julie's speed = 2 * Jewel's speed 
*  Julie's speed = 2 * 50 customers/day = 100 customers/day

**2. Calculate the daily production for both:**

* Jewel's daily production = 50 customers/day
* Julie's daily production = 100 customers/day

**3. Find their weekly production:**

* Weekly production of Jewel = 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers/week
* Weekly production of Julie = 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers/week

**4. Total weekly production:**

* Total weekly production = Jewel's production + Julie's production
* Total weekly production = 350 customers/week + 700 customers/week = 1050 customers/week


{The final answer is} 1050 customers/week

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Information**

* **Reggie, Lynn, and Paisley** all ran together.
* **Paisley ran 4 miles.** 
* **Reggie ran 5 times**. This means we don't know the exact number of miles Reggie ran. 
* **Paisley ran farther than Lynn.** This means we should focus on determining how much longer Paisley ran than Lynn. 

**2. Translate the Statements into a Quantification**

Let's consider 'x' as a variable to represent the distance Lynn ran. We need to find the distance Paisley ran. 

**3. Set up an Equation**

We're trying to find how much farther Paisley ran than Lynn. To do this, we can setup an equation comparing their distances to find the difference.


**4. Solve for the Distance of Paisley**

**Important Note:**  We don't have enough information to directly calculate how many miles Reggie ran.

**Here's how we can solve this step by step:**

1. **Find the cost of one apple:** 
   - Since four apples cost $5.20, one apple costs $5.20 / 4 = $1.30.

2. **Find the cost of one orange:**
   -  Since three oranges cost $3.30, one orange costs $3.30 / 3 = $1.10.

3. **Calculate the cost of 5 apples:**
   -  5 apples cost 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

4. **Calculate the cost of 5 oranges:**
   - 5 oranges cost 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

5. **Find the total cost:**
   -  The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is  $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.



**The final answer is:** $12.00 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.
Each orange cost $3.30/3 = $<<3.30/3=1.10>>1.10.
So 5 apples cost $1.30 x 5 = $<<5*1.30=6.50>>6.50.
And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

                    A bag of flour is divided : into ; 8 portions . of ? 2 kilograms each. : How much flour , (in . kilograms) , was in three ; bags in . total, before it : was divided ; into ! portions?<end_of_turn>
*

Here's how to break it down:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* We're given a bag of flour divided into 8 equal portions of 2 kilograms each.  
* We need to find the total flour amount in 3 bags *before* they were divided.

**2.  Setting up Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the total flour amount in kilograms in one bag. 
* To find the total flour in 3 bags, we need to think about the combined amount from each bag.
    

**3. Forming an Equation**
* We know each bag contains 2 kilograms per portion
* The total flour in three bags will be 3 * 2 kilograms. But there is a catch:

**4. Calculating Initial Flour Amount**

*   3 bags multiply by 2 kilograms = 6 kilograms


{The final answer is 6} 



 <end_of_turn><eos>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.
So, there are 16 x 3 = <<16*3=48>>48 kilograms of flour in 3 bags.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate Alisa's total distance.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 12 miles/hour * 4.5 hours
* Distance = 54 miles

**Step 2: Calculate Stanley's total distance.**

* Distance = Speed x Time
* Distance = 10 miles/hour * 2.5 hours
* Distance = 25 miles

**Step 3: Find the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley.**

* Total distance = Alisa's distance + Stanley's distance
* Total distance = 54 miles + 25 miles 
* Total distance = 79 miles


{The final answer is 79 miles} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles
Stanley = 10 * 2.5 = <<10*2.5=25>>25 miles
54 + 25 = <<54+25=79>>79 miles
Together, Alisa and Stanley biked for 79 miles.

Let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the digging rates for each material**
* Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet/hour in soil.
* He digs at half that speed in clay, which is 4/2 = 2 feet/hour.


**Step 2: Calculate the total time in soil**
* Bill needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
* Divide the total distance he needs to dig in soil by his digging rate in soil: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

**Step 3:  Calculate the total time in clay**
* Bill needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
* Divide the total distance he needs to dig in clay by his digging rate in clay : 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.

**Step 4: Calculate the total digging time.**
* Add the time spent digging in soil and clay. 
* 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours


 
**Final answer:** It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour
Then find how long he spends digging through clay in total: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = <<8/2=4>>4 hours
Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

If he gets the same amount of ! 2 cupcakes for each : himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?<end_of_turn>
    

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of his reasoning:

1. **Identify the Key Information:**
   * Howie wants cupcakes for everyone in his class - this includes himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates.
   * He's getting 1 vanilla cupcake and 1 chocolate cupcake for each person.
   * Howie buys the same amount for himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates.


2. **Calculate Total People:**
   * Howie has 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people to buy cupcakes for.

3. **Determine the Total Cupcakes Requirement:**
   * Howie buys 1 vanilla cupcake and 1 chocolate cupcake for each person, so he needs 27 cupcakes. 


**The final answer is 27 cupcakes.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.
He wants to get 2 cupcakes for everyone, so 27 people x 2 cupcakes each = <<27*2=54>>54 cupcakes that Howie should buy.

Let's break down this problem:

**1. Initial Likes:**

* We know Fishio started with 2000 likes. This is our initial starting point.

**2. Three Weeks Later:**

* Three weeks after her original post, the number of likes was 70 times the initial amount. 
*  70 times the initial number of likes means 70 * 2000 = 140000 likes. This is the number of likes after three weeks. 

**3. New Likes:**

* We know she received 20000 more likes recently. This means her total like count now is 140000 + 20000 = 160000 likes.

**Solution:**

1. **Cost on Tuesday:**
   * Price per pomegranate: $20
   * Number of pomegranates: 20
   * Total cost on Tuesday: $20 * 20 = $400

2. **Discount on Tuesday:**
   * Discount amount: $2 
   * Final cost on Tuesday: $400 - $2 = $398

3. **Price on Wednesday:** 
   * Price per pomegranate: $30
   * Number of pomegranates: 20
   * Total cost on Wednesday:  $30 * 20 = $600

4. **10% discount on total Wednesday cost:**
   * Discount amount: $600 * 0.10 = $60
   * Final cost after discount: $600 - $60 = $540

5. **Difference in final cost:**
   * Final cost on Tuesday: $398

Here is the solution:

**Step 1: Define variables.**

* Let 'x' represent the amount Ariadne made from selling green hats. 
 
**Step 2: Set up an equation based on the first month's sales.**

*  We know that Ariadne earned $400 from red hats. 
*  She earned half the amount from green hats, meaning: x = 400 / 2
*  This simplifies to: x = 200

**Step 3: Figure out the total amount from the first month.**

*  Total sales from green hats: x = 200
*  Total sales from red hats: 400

**Step 4: Determine total months' sales.**

* Total sales in the second month: 3/4 * total sales of the first month
* The final step is to find the total amount in both months.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understanding the Problem**

* **Details:** James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. He has 1 hour of free time. The first hour is $15, and each hour after the first hour costs twice the price of the first hour.
* **Goal:** We need to find out how much James paid for the carriage ride.

**2.  Setting up the Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the number of hours James uses the carriage.
* Notice that the problem says the carriage ride is for 4 hours, meaning that  he uses the carriage for 4 hours


**3.  Formulating the Equation**

* The cost of the carriage ride is based on the number of hours used.  
* We can write this as a mathematical equation:

  **Cost = $15 + (2 * $15) for hours 2, 3, and 4** 

 
**4. Calculating the Cost**


*We have a specific number of hours, so we can plug it in* 
Cost = $15 + (2 * $15)
Cost = $15 + $30
Cost = $45

 


**The final answer is $45**<end_of_turn><eos>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours
He pays for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours
The first hour cost 1*15=$<<1*15=15>>15
The other 3-1=2 hours are more expensive
They cost 15*2=$<<15*2=30>>30 per hour
So those 2 hours cost 2*30=$<<2*30=60>>60
So he pays 60+15=$<<60+15=75>>75 per hours

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the known information:**

*   Sally's starting bank balance: $200
*   Final bank balance: $420
*   Expected weekly wage: $300

**2. Determine the difference between the final and starting balances:** 

*  $420 (Final) - $200 (Starting) = $220

**3.  Identify the unexpected increase in her bank account:**

  * The bank balance increased by $220, and we know no other money entered the account, so the increase must be from her salary being paid correctly.

**4.  Calculate the amount withheld from her wage:** 

* $220 (increase in balance) = $300 (expected wage) - $220 (the unexpected increase)


 
{The final answer is $300}

 **Solution:**
 1. **Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves Lori needs:** 
    * Lori expects each guest to eat 3 deviled egg halves. 
    * She is having 16 guests. 
    *  Total deviled egg halves: 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves/guest = 48 deviled egg halves. 
 
 2. **Calculate the number of whole eggs needed:** 
    * Lori needs 1 whole egg for 2 deviled egg halves.
    * She needs 48 deviled egg halves. 
   * Egg needed: 48 deviled egg halves / 2 egg halves/deviled egg half = 24 whole eggs
 
 3. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs needed:** 
    *  She needs 24 whole eggs.
    *  Each dozen contains 12 eggs. 
    *  Number of dozens needed: 24 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 2 dozens


 {The final answer is 2 dozens of eggs} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves
1 whole egg is needed to make 2 halves so 48 halves is 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 whole eggs
1 dozen is equal to 12 and she needs 24 eggs so she needs 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 dozen eggs

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate fuel costs:**

* James spends twice as much on fuel as rent: $5000 * 2 = $10,000 per month
 
**2. Determine annual fuel cost:**

*  Annual fuel costs: $10,000/month * 12 months = $120,000

**3. Calculate total monthly costs:**

* Total monthly costs: $5000 (rent) + $10,000 (fuel) = $15,000

**4. Determine total annual costs:**

* Total annual costs: $15,000/month * 12 months = $180,000

**5. Calculate the total cost of the plane:**

* Total cost = Plane price + Annual costs
* Total cost =$150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000



 {The final answer is $330,000} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

So he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year
That means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1.  Cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts**
   * **Calculate the cost of 1/2 pound of almonds:** $10/pound * (1/2) pound = $5  
   * **Calculate the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts:** $15/pound * (1/3) pound = $5 
   * **Calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:** $5 + $5 = $10

**2. Cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts**
   * **Calculate the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds:** $10/pound * (1/5) pound = $2
   * **Calculate the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts:** $15/pound * (1/3) pound = $5 
   * **Calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:** $2 + $5 = $7

**3. Calculate the difference in cost**
   * **Subtract the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts from the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:** $10 - $7 = $3

 




**The final answer is: $3** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

**Solution Approach**
   1. **Define Variables:**
      * Let  'x' represent the number of sheep.
      * Let 'y' represent the number of geese.

   2. **Set Up Equations from Given Information:**
      * Equation 1 (Leg Count): 4x + 2y = 70  (Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2)
      * Equation 2 (Head Count): x + y = 20   (Each sheep and goose has 1 head) 

   3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
      *  You can use substitution or elimination methods to solve for x and y. We will use substitution. 
      * Solve Equation 2 for x: x = 20 - y
      * Substitute this value of x into Equation 1: 4(20 - y) + 2y = 70 
      * Simplify and solve for y: 80 - 4y + 2y = 70  => -2y = -10 => y = 5
      * Substitute the value of y back into the equation for x: x = 20 - 5 => x = 15

  
**Answer:**
{The final answer is 15 sheep} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Find the price of the more expensive brand:**

* The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
* Calculate 20% of $5:  0.20 * $5 = $1
* The more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6

**2. Calculate the total weekly cost of coffee:**

* He buys 1 pound of coffee per day, and he wants to buy a week's worth. 
* Total coffee cost: 1 pound/day * 7 days/week = 7 pounds
* Total coffee cost: 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42

**3. Calculate the final cost of the donut:**

* The donut costs $2.

**4. Calculate the total cost of everything:**

* Total cost: $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44

**The final answer is: $44** 




<end_of_turn><eos>","The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the cost of the chips:**

* Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each.
* Cost of chips = 2 bags * $2.00/bag = $4.00

**2. Calculate the total cost of the items:**

* Cost of chips: $4.00
* Cost of fried chicken: $8.00
* Cost of soda: $1.00
* Total cost: $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

**3.  Determine the cost of the apple pie:**

* Gus spent a total of $20.00. 
* Cost of chips + Fried chicken + Soda = $13.00
* Cost of apple pie = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

 {The final answer is $7.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00
He spent $4.00 on chips, $8.00 on fried chicken and $1.00 on soda so he spent 4+8+1 = $<<4+8+1=13.00>>13.00
He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understand the problem:**

*   We know James delivers 600 newspapers daily.
*   He delivers 198 to District A. 
*    We need to find out how many he delivers to District B.
*    He delivers 209 to District C.

**2.  Use the total deliveries:** 

*   We know James delivers a total of 600 newspapers per day. 
*   This total consists of deliveries for District A, District B, and District C.



**3.  Set up the equation:**

* Let 'x' be the number of newspapers James delivers to District B.


**4.  Solve for x:**

* 600 = 198 + x + 209
 
* 600 = 198 + x + 209 
* 600 = 307 + x
* x = 600 - 307
* x = 293



**5. Final Answer**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of type A candies:**

* Cost per candy of type A: $0.50
* Number of type A candies: 7
* Cost of type A candies: $0.50 × 7 = $3.50

**2. Calculate the cost of type B candies:**

* Cost per candy of type B: $0.75
* Number of type B candies: 10
* Cost of type B candies: $0.75 × 10 = $7.50

**3. Calculate the total cost of all the candies:**

* Total cost: $3.50 + $7.50 = $11.00 


**4. Determine the change paid:**

* Amount paid: $15.00
* Total cost: $11.00
* Change: $15.00 - $11.00 = $4.00

**{The Final Answer is $4.00}** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

Here's the breakdown of my thought process:

1. **Define the unknown:**
   * Let 'x' represent the number of books Sally has. 

2. **Formulate an equation:**
   * ""Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has"" can be written as an equation:  2 * x + 3 = 21
  
3. **Solve for the unknown:**
   * Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 2 * x = 18
   * Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 9

4. **Answer the question:**
   * Sally has 9 books. {The final answer is 9}

"Mrs. Jameson's bamboo : in the backyard grows ! up ? to 30 inches . a , day. Today, its ; height is , 20 . feet. In ! how . many days will : its height be ! 600 inches?","<bos><start_of_turn>user
Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Mrs. Jameson's bamboo : in the backyard grows ! up ? to 30 inches . a , day. Today, its ; height is , 20 . feet. In ! how . many days will : its height be ! 600 inches?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We need to calculate the number of days it takes for a bamboo plant to grow to 600 inches.
* We know the plant's daily growth rate: 30 inches. 
* We know its initial height: 20 feet, which is equal to 240 inches.

**2.  Formula and Calculation:**

* To find the number of days, we can use a direct formula relationship. Since it grows at a consistent rate of 30 inches daily, we can find the number of days based on the target height (600 inches).
* We'll utilize the following formula:
    * Number of days = (target height - initial height) / daily growth rate
    * Number of days = (600 inches - 240 inches) / 30 inches/day
    * Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches/day
    * Number of days = 12 days

**3. Conclusion:**

* According to the formula and the given data, it will take **12 days** for the bamboo plant to grow to 600 inches.



{The final answer is 12 days.}<end_of_turn><eos>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

*Hint: Draw a simple diagram to help visualize the problem.*

**Solution:**
1. **Start with the initial number of dogs:**  We know James started with 4 toys for 4 dogs.  
2. **Calculate the new number of dogs:**  8 more dogs showed up at the shelter, increasing the dog population by 8.
3. **Calculate the total number of dogs:**  
   The new total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.  
4. **Determine the number of toys needed:**
    Each dog needs one toy. so, to care for 12 dogs, James needs 12 * 1 = 12 toys.  
5. **Account for the dogs that left:**
   3 dogs left, so James no longer needs the toys 
6. **Final calculation:**

*  Dylan's investment is 2/5 of $1200.
*  (2/5) * $1200 = $480

**2. Calculate the amount remaining after Dylan's investment:**

*  Total initial investment - Dylan's investment = Remaining amount
*  $1200 - $480 = $720

**3. Calculate Frances's investment:**

* Frances's investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount.
* (2/3) * $720 = $480

**4. Calculate Skyler's investment:**

*  Skyler's investment is the remaining amount minus Dylan's and Frances's investment.
*  $720 - $480 - $480 = $0

*Please show step by step reasoning.*

**Here's how we can solve this problem:**

1. **Calculate total signatures needed:** 
   -  The sisters want to reach 100 signatures. 
2. **Calculate how many signatures they've already collected:**
   - Carol has 20 signatures.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Find out how much Lorie earns in one day.**

* Lorie earns $10 per hour.
* Lorie works 3 hours per day.
* Lorie's daily earnings = $10/hour * 3 hours/day = $30/day

**Step 2: Find out how much Karen earns in one day.**

* Karen earns twice Lorie's earnings.
* Karen's daily earnings = $10/hour * 2 * 3 hours/day = $60/day 

**Step 3: Find out how much Karen earns in two days.**

* Karen earns $60/day * 2 days = $120

**The final answer is $120** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Karen earns $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 per hour.
So she earns $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 per day.
Thus, she earns $60 x 2 = $<<60*2=120>>120 in two days.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Find out how many cookies Max has:**
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - So, Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

2. **Find out how many cookies Max has more than the Cookie Monster:**
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
   - We need to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. 
   - We know Max has 73 cookies, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

3. **Find out how many cookies Summer has:**
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, and Max has 73 cookies.
   - So, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

4. **Calculate the total cookies:**
   - Katarina has 68 cookies

                    There ? is one set of twins and , one set ! of . triplets. One twin is 7 , years ? older . than ! one triplet. : If ! their combined ages , are 44, how ! old is one of the twins?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we break down the problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 't' represent the age of the twin.
* Let '3t' represent the age of the triplet.

**2. Formulate Equations:**

* We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet: t = 3t - 7 
* The combined ages of the twin and triplet are 44: t + 3t = 44

**3. Solve for 't' using the equations:**

*  Substitute the first equation into the second equation: (3t - 7) + 3t = 44
* Simplify and solve for 't': 6t - 7 = 44
* Add 7 to both sides: 6t = 51
* Divide both sides by 6: t = 8.5

**4.  Final Answer:** 
 {The final answer is 8.5} 



Let me know if you would like to go through another problem or have questions. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let T = age of triplet
Twin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7
Twin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)
Triplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T
2 * (T + 7) + 3T = 44
2T + 14 + 3T = 44
5T + 14 = 44
5T = 30
T = <<6=6>>6
Twin = 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13
The twins are each <<13=13>>13 years old.

**Here's the breakdown of the solution:**

1. **Break down the problem:** We need to figure out how much time John has *available* for sleep after finishing his homework. 
2. **Calculate total homework time:**  
    * Math: 20 minutes
    * Reading: 40 minutes
    * History: 20 minutes
    * Total homework time: 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. 
3. **Convert homework time to minutes:**  Remember homework takes up 80 minutes.
4. **Calculate available time for nap:**
    * Total time until dinner (before eating) is: 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.
    * Total time for homework: 80 minutes.
    * Subtract available time from total homework time.
    * Time available for nap = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes
5. **Consider the time for napping:** 

**Final answer:** {John has 100 minutes to nap}. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.
John has 3 hours*60 minutes= <<3*60=180>>180 minutes before dinner.
Thus, John has 180-80=<<180-80=100>>100 minutes for his nap.

<eos>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate Neil's monthly saving:** 
    * 2/5 times Rong's saving is (2/5) * 20 coins = 8 coins.
    * Neil saves 8 coins more than Rong, so he saves 8 + 20 coins = 28 coins per month.

2. **Determine their savings over 10 years:**
    * Rong saves 20 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 2400 coins.
    * Neil saves 28 coins/month * 12 months/year * 10 years = 3360 coins.

3. **Calculate the total savings:**
    * Their total savings after 10 years is 2400 coins + 3360 coins = 5760 coins.


**{The final answer is 5760 coins.}**   


<end_of_turn><eos>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.
The total number of coins they both have in their piggy banks after ten years of saving is 3360+2400 = <<3360+2400=5760>>5760

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines.**

* Cost of one vaccine: $20
* Cost of two vaccines: $20 * 2 = $40

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.**

* The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. 
* Let's represent the total bill as ""x"".
* Cost of the heartworm check: 0.60x

**Step 3: Set up an equation for the total bill.**

* Total cost = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
* $125 = $40 + 0.60x


**Step 4: Solve the equation for x (the total bill).**

* $125 - $40 = 0.60x
* $85 = 0.60x
*  x = $85 / 0.60
* x = $141.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Step 5: Calculate the amount John leaves with.**

*  Money brought: $125
*  Total bill: $141.67 
*  Amount John leaves with: $125 - $141.67 = -$16.67




{The final answer is -$16.67} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The vaccines are 40% of his total bill because 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40
The total bill is $100 because 40 / .4 = <<40/.4=100>>100
He leaves with $25 because 125 - 100 = <<125-100=25>>25

Here's how we'll break down the problem:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'x' be the cost of one banana. 
* Let 'y' be the cost of one apple. 

**2.  Set Up Equations**

* **Equation 1 (Cost of Bananas):**  x * 5 (since each crate has 5 bananas) =  the price of a crate
* **Equation 2 (Cost of Apples):** y * 12 (since each crate has 12 apples) = the price of a crate
* **Equation 3 (Cost of Oranges):** 3 * x (since the price of an orange is three times the price of a banana)

**3. Express the Price of a Crate in terms of the cost of individual fruits**

 To calculate the overall price of a crate, we need to include the cost of all the fruits inside.

**4. Solve for the cost of a crate**

We can do this using a combination of the equations we set up.

* **Equation 1 (Cost of bananas) & Equation 2 (Cost of Apples):** These equations help us find the combined cost of the bananas and apples in a crate.


* **Equation 3 (Cost of Oranges):** We use this to determine the final price of a crate of fruit


 
**5. Final Answer**

 {The final answer is }



Let me know if you need any further details or clarification on the steps. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   * Let 'r' represent the number of blue squares.
   * Let 'g' represent the number of green squares.
   * Let 'w' represent the number of white squares.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  We know there are 14 red squares:  r + g + w + 14 = total number of squares
   *  We know there are 4 more blue squares than red: r = r + 4 
   *  We know there are 6 more green squares than blue: g = r + 6
   *  We know there are 12 fewer white squares than green: w = g - 12

3. **Solve the equations:**
   * Combine all equations to get an expression for 'r'.

4. **Calculate the total area of the squares:**
   * Calculate the area of each individual square, by multiplying its length and width: 
   * Calculate the total area of all the squares.

5. **Find the size of the comforter:** 
   *  Multiply the number of squares by their area to find the total area.




Let me know if you would like to work through specific steps or a final summary. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Find the number of regular chairs:**

* The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
* Regular chairs: 8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs.

**2. Find the total number of chairs:**

*  Total chairs: 40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 chairs.

**3. Determine the number of additional chairs needed:**

* Additional chairs needed: 48 chairs  - 42 adult chairs = 6 chairs.


{The final answer is 6} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

How many points . is ! the class missing to go on the trip if the minimum threshold ? is . 400 points?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate Betty's points:**

   * Betty collected 30% more than Adam, who collected 50 points.
   * 30% of 50 = (30/100) * 50 = 15 points
   * Betty's points = Adam's points + 15 points = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

**2. Calculate Marta's points:**

   * Marta collected 3 times more than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty.
   *  Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * (Betty's points - 30)

**3. Calculate Tom's points:**

   * Tom has 30 points less than Betty's points.
   * Tom's points = Betty's points - 30 points = 65 - 30 = 35 points.

**4. Calculate Marta's points:**
   * Marta's points = 3 * Tom's points = 3 * 35 = 105 points.

**5. Calculate the total points collected by the students:**

*  Adam: 50
*  Betty: 65
*  Marta: 105
*  Tom: 35 

* Total points = Adam's points + Betty's points + Marta's points + Tom's points= 50+65+105+35= 255 points.

**6. Determine the points remaining:**

* Points required for the trip: 400 
* Points already collected: 255
* Points remaining = 400 - 255 = 145 points.


{The final answer is 145} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

*Explain your reasoning in detail.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the amount deposited into the retirement account:**
   *  50% of $2400.00 = (50/100) * $2400.00 = $1200.00
2. **Calculate the amount spent on the car payment:**
   * 20% of $2400.00 = (20/100) * $2400.00 = $480.00
3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   * $1200.00 (retirement) + $480.00 (car) = $1680.00
4. **Calculate the amount remaining:**
   * $2400.00 (paycheck) - $1680.00 (spent) = $720.00

**The final answer is**: $720.00 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts 50% into her retirement so that’s 2400*.50 = $<<2400*.50=1200.00>>1200.00
Her paycheck is $2400.00 and she puts $1200 into retirement so that leaves 2400-1200 = $<<2400-1200=1200.00>>1200.00
Her car payment is 20% of 2400 so her car payment is .20*2400 = $<<20*.01*2400=480.00>>480.00
She had $1200 left and she uses $480.00 to make her car payment which leaves her with 1200-480 = $<<1200-480=720.00>>720.00 remaining for spending

Hannah's house ! is at , the right , angle to see 40% : of the , city's fireworks. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks ? each in her backyard. How many fireworks will ! Hannah see in total?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Fireworks from the main display:**

* **Boxes of fireworks:** 15 boxes.
* **Fireworks per box:** 20.
* **Total fireworks from main display:** 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

**2. Fireworks Hannah sees from her house:**

* **Percentage of city's fireworks she sees:** 40%
* **Total fireworks from main display:** 300 fireworks
* **Fireworks Hannah sees:** 300 fireworks * 0.40 = 120 fireworks


**3. Fireworks in her backyard:**

* **Boxes of fireworks:** 3 boxes
* **Fireworks per box:** 5
* **Total fireworks in backyard:** 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

**4. Total Fireworks**

* **Fireworks from main display** : 300
* **Fireworks from backyard**: 15
* **Total fireworks:** 300 + 15 = 315


{The final answer is 315} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks

*Note: Please review and make sure it follows instructions and ask for clarification if unsure!*

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Find how many friends are attending the film.**

* Aiden has 1/12 of his friends going to the movie. 
* This means the total number of friends attending is 12/1 of his friends
* *Note: This seems ambiguous, we can further clarify the problem*

 
**Step 2: Find how many seats are filled.**

* There are 12/12 friends plus 7 more friends
* The total number of friends going to the movie 12/12 + 7
* *Note: We are missing a factor, clarification is needed*
 


**Step 3: Determine the number of drinks and snacks per person**
* The seats each hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks.
* *Note: We need total number of seats*


**Step 4: Calculate the cost of drinks and snacks** 
* Drinks cost $2 each.
* Snacks cost $2 each.
* Calculate total cost based on the number of drinks and snacks per person.
  {The final answer is }


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

{The final answer is}

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**
*  Let 'G' represent the number of pounds that Gissela's truck can haul.
* Let 'O' represent the number of pounds that Gordy's truck can haul.
* Let 'G_' represent the number of pounds that Gary's truck can haul.

**2. Set Up Equations**
* We know that Gissela's truck can haul 4000 pounds. This is represented as:  G = 4000
* Gordy's truck can haul 800 more than Gissela's truck. This can be represented as: O = G + 800 
* The three trucks combined can haul 11600 pounds. We can combine the amounts from Gissela and Gordy to get: G + O + G = 11600 
 

**3. Solve for G**

*  Substitute the values of G and O from step 2 into the equation from step 2.
*  Substitute the value of G from step 1 into the combined haul equation from step 2.
{The final answer is}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.
Thus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Determine the number of dumplings each female ate:**

* Each female ate 3 dumplings.

**2. Determine the number of dumplings each male ate:**

* Each male ate 1 + 3 = 4 dumplings.

**3. Determine the total number of dumplings eaten by females:**

*  6 women * 3 dumplings/woman = 18 dumplings


**4. Determine the total number of dumplings eaten by males:**

* 8 males * 4 dumplings/male = 32 dumplings

**5. Determine the total number of dumplings eaten:**

 * 18 dumplings + 32 dumplings = 50 dumplings

**6. Determine how many dumplings Larry cooked:**

* The total number of dumplings to be baked
* Larry cooked 50 dumplings


 {The final answer is 50 dumplings } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio:** The ratio 3:2 means that for every $3 Gerald receives, Julia receives $2.

2. **Calculate the Value of One Share:**  To find out the value of one share in the ratio, divide the total money by the ratio parts.  
     * ($100 / 5) = $20 per share
    
3. **Find Gerald's Portion:** To find how much money Gerald received, multiply his share value by the proportion representing his share of the ratio.
     * $20 x 3 = $60

4. **Calculate Gerald's Remaining Money:** Subtract what Gerald spent from his total share.
     * $60 - $10 = $50


{The final answer is $50} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

* The problem states that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. This means the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed.

**2.  Determine the Turtle's Speed:**

*  Let 'x' represent the turtle's speed.
*  We know the cat's speed is 5 times the turtle's speed, therefore, the cat's speed is 5x.
*  We are given the cat's speed is 15 feet per second.

**3. Set up an Equation:**

* We can set up an equation based on the given information and the relationship between the speeds. 
* 15 = 5x 

**4. Solve for the Turtle's Speed:** 

* To find the turtle's speed, we need to solve the equation for x
* x = 15/5
* x = 3 feet/second

**5. Calculate the Turtle's Distance:**

* We know the turtle’s speed is 3 feet/second.
* We are given the time as 40 seconds.
* Distance = speed * time
* Distance = 3 feet/second * 40 seconds
* Distance = 120 feet


{The final answer is 120 feet} 
   
<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second
Then multiply the turtle's speed by the number of seconds it spends crawling to find how far it crawls: 40 seconds * 3 feet/second = <<40*3=120>>120 feet

Here's how we can break down the problem and find the answer:

**1.  Determine the amount of water the city uses for industrial purposes:**

*   We know Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
*   To find out how much is used for industrial purposes, we multiply the city's water use by the proportion for industrial use: 40% * 80% = 32% 

**2. Find the amount of water the city uses for non-industrial purposes:**

*  Subtracting the industrial water use from the total water use gives us the amount for non-industrial purposes: 100% - 32% = 68%

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost of picking at the farm:**
    *  He spent $20 for going to the farm.
    *  He paid $1.50 per pound * 30 pounds = $45 for blueberries.
    *  Total cost at the farm is $20 + $45 = $65.

2. **Calculate the cost of buying blueberries at the store:**
    * $2.50 per pound * 30 pounds = $75 

3. **Find the difference between the farm price and store price:**
    * $75  - $65 = $10

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Determine the original cost of each computer:**

* The company had $700 for each computer.

**2. Calculate the increase in the price of each computer:**

* The price increase is 10% of the original price. 
*  This can be represented as 0.10 * $700 = $70.

**3. Calculate the new price of each computer:**

* New price = Original price + Increase 
*  New price =  $700 + $70 =  $770

**4. Calculate the total cost of the new computers:**

* Total cost = Number of computers * New Price per Computer 
* Total cost = 500 * $770 = $385,000 


{The final answer is $385,000} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70

   * Total calories from cheese: 2 * 120 calories/ounce = 240 calories

**3. Calculate the calories from the ham:**

   * Amount of ham: 2 oz
   * Calories per ounce: 40 calories/ounce
   * Total calories from ham: 2 * 40 calories/ounce = 80 calories

**4. Calculate the total calories:**

Here's a breakdown of the problem and solution, step-by-step:
 
 **1. Define Variables:**
    * Let `x` represent the cost of one eraser.

**2. Set Up Equations:**
    * Cost of 6 pencils: 6 * $0.50 = $3.00 
    * Cost of 8 erasers: 8 * x = 8x
    * Total cost: $3.00 + 8x = $10.00

 **3. Solve for x:**
    * Subtract $3.00 from both sides of the equation: 8x = $7.00
    * Divide both sides by 8: x = $0.875 


**4. Calculate the cost of the erasers:**
   * 8x = 8 * $0.875 = $7.00

**5. Calculate the change:**
   *  $10.00 - $7.00 = $3.00


**The final answer is: $3.00** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.
8 erasers cost 8 x $0.25 = $<<8*0.25=2>>2.
Thus, you spent $3 + $2 = $<<3+2=5>>5.
Therefore, you would get $10 - $5 = $<<10-5=5>>5 change.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1.  Calculate the tap rate without arms raised:**

* Helga taps her right foot at 300 taps/minute.
* Helga taps her left foot at 250 taps/minute.
* Her total tap rate without arms raised is 300 + 250= 550 taps/minute. 

**2. Calculate the total taps during the 5-minute dance performance:**

* Her tap rate without arms raised is 550 taps/minute.
* She dances for 5 minutes.
* Her total taps would be 550 taps/minute * 5 minutes = 2750 taps. 


**3. Calculate the taps during the 2 minutes with arms raised:**

* She dances with arms raised for 2 minutes.
* Her total taps is 200 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 400 taps

**4. Calculate the total taps during the full dance performance:**


* Total taps when arms are down: 2750 taps
* Total taps when arms are up: 400 taps
* Total taps for the full performance: 2750 taps + 400 taps = 3150 taps

{The final answer is 3150}

**Solution:**

1. **Define the costs and amounts:**
   * Ron's potential damage: $450
   * City council fine: $120
   * Cost of asphalt per bucket: $25
   * Number of buckets: 3

2. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   * Total cost of asphalt: 3 * $25 = $75
   * Total cost of fixing: $75 + $120 = $195
   
3. **Calculate the potential savings:**

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the number of normal chairs sent:**

*  20% of 170 normal chairs = (20/100) * 170 = 34 normal chairs

**2. Calculate the number of baby chairs sent:**

* 13% of 23 baby chairs = (13/100) * 23 = 2.99 baby chairs (We cannot have a partial chair, so we round down to 2 baby chairs)

**3. Calculate the number of normal chairs remaining:**

*  170 normal chairs - 34 normal chairs = 136 normal chairs

**4. Calculate the number of baby chairs remaining:**

* 23 baby chairs - 2 baby chairs = 21 baby chairs


**5. Calculate the total number of chairs remaining:**

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the total slices eaten by Bryce and his friends:**

* Each pizza had 12 slices.
* Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of the pizza = (2/3) * 12 slices
* Simplifies to: 8 slices

**2.  Calculate the total slices eaten by the two remaining friends:**

* Two friends ate ¾ of their pizza
* The two friends ate ( ¾ ) * 12 slices 
* Simplifies to: 9.6 slices

**3. Determine the total number of slices eaten** 

* Total slices eaten: 8 slices (Bryce and friends) + 9.6 slices (remaining friends)

**4. Calculate the total number of slices**

* Remember the original number of pizzas
 
 **5.  Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**

  




{The final answer is 120} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the time the dog takes.**

* The dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat, so let's say 'x' is the number of sausages the dog eats per time. 
* The question says the dog eats the same number of sausages `in 2/3 the amount` of time the cat takes.
* Therefore, the time the dog takes is 30 minutes * (2/3)

**Step 2: Simplify the time the dog takes.**

* (30 minutes * (2/3)) = 20 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the average time**

* The average time the cat takes is 30 minutes.
* The average time the dog takes is 20 minutes.
* To find the average time, we add the times together and divide the sum by 2.

{The average time the two take is 25 minutes} 

 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.
The total amount of time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

If the length of one of Topher’s shoes : is ! 8-feet and 4-inches, how ! long, in inches, . is one , of : Bobby’s shoes?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Topher's shoes are significantly larger than Bobby's shoes.
   - We need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, given the length of one of Topher's shoes.
   
2. **Conversion:** 
   - Convert everything to inches: 
     - 8 feet = 8 * 12 inches = 96 inches
     - 4 inches 

3. **Set up an Equation:**
   - The problem tells us the length of a Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 
   We can express this as: 
   - 96 inches (Topher's shoe length) = 10 inches (longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe length)

4. **Solve for the Length of Bobby's Shoe:** 
   - We'll use the information about the relationship between Topher's shoe length and Bobby's shoe length.


**{The final answer is: 96 inches}** 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

This question seems like it might be a bit tricky, so let's break it down step-by-step:

**1. Students' Cars:**

* **Number of student cars:** 64 
* **Number of windows per car:** 4
* **Total windows smashed from student cars:**  64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows

**2. Teacher's Cars:**

* **Number of teacher cars:** 32
* **Number of windows per car:** 2
* **Total windows smashed from teacher cars:** 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows


**3.  Total Windows Smashed**

* **Total windows smashed from student cars:** 256 windows
* **Total windows smashed from teacher cars:** 64 windows
* **Total windows smashed:** 256 windows + 64 windows = 320 windows


**4. Final Answer** 
{The final answer is 320}

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the number of people who had not voted by 16:00. 

**Step 2: Set up Equations**

* **Midday voting:**  2/5 of the initial people voted by midday. 
   * (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people voted. 
* **Remaining people:** The number of people remaining isn't initial number of people, so it is calculated.
  * 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people remained.
* **Voting by 16:00:** 2/3 of the remaining people voted by 16:00.
   * (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people voted.

**Step 3: Solve for the Initial Number of People**

We can solve the equation for x, given by:

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**Step 1: Determine how many pieces of gum Parker needs in 30 days.**

* He chews 4 pieces/day.
* He wants to chew gum for 30 days.
*  Therefore, he needs 4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum. 

**Step 2: Calculate how many packs of gum he needs.**

* Each pack has 15 pieces.
* He needs 120 pieces of gum.
* Therefore, he needs 120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs of gum.

**The final answer is 8 packs of gum.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum

Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let 'd' represent Dora's current age.
* Let 'f' represent Dora's father's current age.
* Let 'm' represent Dora's mother's current age.

**2. Set up Equations Based on the Given Information**

*  ""Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age"":  f = 2d + 8
*  ""Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father"": m = f - 4
*  ""Dora is 15 years old"": d = 15

**3. Solve for the Age of the Father:**

* Substitute the value of 'd' into the equation for 'f': f = 2(15) + 8
* Calculate: f = 30 + 8 
* Solution: f = 38 

**4. Solve for the Age of the Mother:**

* Substitute the value of 'f' into the equation for 'm': m = 38 - 4
* Calculate: m = 34

**5. Calculate the Total Combined Age**

*  Add Dora's age, her father's age, and her mother's age: d + f + m = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87


 
{The final answer is 87}<end_of_turn><eos>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate candidate B's votes:**
    * Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.
    *  This means candidate B got 20% + (20% * 0.50) = 20% + 10% = 30% of the votes. 

2. **Calculate the part of votes allocated to candidate C:**
    * The remaining votes after A and B's votes were are 100% - 20% - 30% = 50%

3. **Calculate the votes received by candidate C:**
    * Candidate C received 50% of the votes, which is 50% of 100 = 50 votes


{ The final answer is 50 votes}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.
Candidate B got 20 x 50/100 = <<20*50/100=10>>10 more votes than candidate A.
Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find how many apples Beck has:**

* Boris has 100 apples.
* Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

**2. Find the amount of apples Boris gives Beck:**

* Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

**3. Find how many apples Beck has after receiving from Boris:**

* Beck had 77 apples.
* She gets 10 more apples.
* Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

**4. Find the difference between Beck's apples and Boris's apples:**

* Boris has 100 apples.
* Beck has 87 apples.
* The difference is 100 - 87 = 13 apples.

**5. Final Answer** 
{The final answer is 13 } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

* The question requires problem solving, so you need to break it down step-by-step to ensure a clear understanding.



**Step 1: Calculate the total ounces of water used for giant cubes.**

*  Giant cubes: 32 ounces 
*  Giant cubes per ounce: 4 ounces

*  Total ounces of water for giant cubes: (32 ounces) * (4 ounces/giant cube) = 128 ounces



**Step 2: Calculate the total ounces of water used for medium cubes.**

* Medium cubes: 7 cubes
* Medium cubes per ounce: 2 ounces

* Total ounces of water for medium cubes: (7 cubes) * (2 ounces/medium cube) = 14 ounces 


**Step 3: Calculate the total ounces of water used for small cubes.**

* Small cubes: 8 cubes
* Small cubes per ounce: 1/2 ounce

* Total ounces of water for small cubes: (8 cubes) * (1/2 ounce/small cube) = 4 ounces


**Step 4: Calculate the total ounces of water used** 

* Total ounces used: 128 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 146 ounces


**Step 5: Calculate the ounces of water remaining**
 
* Total water: 32 ounces

*  Ounces remaining: 32 ounces - 146 ounces = -114 ounces 
 


{The final answer is -114 ounces} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Finding the cost of a half-gallon jar:**

* We know a gallon jar costs $5 and costs more than a half-gallon jar.
* Let x represent the cost of a half-gallon jar.
* Since a gallon jar costs $5, and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can conclude: 
    * $5 = $2 + x.
* Solve for x: 
   * $5 - $2 = x 
   * $3 = x
 

**2. calculating the total cost of 10-gallon jars:**

* We know 10-gallon jars cost $5 each.
* Total cost of 10-gallon jars = $5/jar * 10 jars = $50


**3. Calculating the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**

* We know half-gallon jars cost $3 each.
* Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = $3/jar * 16 jars = $48




**4.Total cost calculation**
* Total cost =  Cost of 10-gallon jars + Cost of 16 half-gallon jars 
* Total cost = $50 + $48 = $98




**The final answer is $98.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3
If he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50
For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48
The total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Identify the given information:**

* Number of students: 50
* Hobbies:
    * Baking: 10 students
    * Basketball: 5 students
    * Music:   x students (unknown)
    * Video games: y students (unknown)



**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

* We can use the given information to formulate relationships between the different types of hobbies. 
* **Total students who like baking + basketball:** 10 + 5 = 15 


**3. Solve the remaining unknowns:**

* **Use the given information to establish a relationship**
* **Students who like video games:**  y = 2 * ( Students who like Basketball)
 
**4. Finalize the answer**



{The final answer is 10} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

*I need help determining how to calculate the answer.*

**Step 1:** Calculate the number of birds scared away. 
   * Multiply the original number of birds by the fraction of birds scared away: 12 birds * (1/3) = 4 birds
 
**Step 2:**  Calculate the number of birds remaining after the initial scare.
   * Subtract the number of birds scared away from the original number of birds: 12 birds - 4 birds = 8 birds.

**Step 3:**  Calculate the total number of birds after the new birds joined.
   * Add the new birds to the remaining birds: 8 birds + 20 birds = 28 birds

**The final answer is 28 birds.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.

**Breakdown:**

1. **Define variables:**
   - Let `x` be the number of students in each class. 

2. **Set up an equation:**
   - The total number of students in both classes is 80, so:  2x = 80

3. **Solve for x:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2: x = 40

4. **Calculate the number of girls in each class:**
   - 40% of  the students in each class are girls, so: 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls. 

5. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:** 
   -  Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys: 40 - 16 = 24 boys


{The final answer is 24 } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the packs:**

* Mark buys 3 packs at $1800/pack.
* Total cost = 3 * $1800 = $5400

**2. Calculate the value of the two valuable cards:**

* Value of the first card: $4000
* Value of the second card: $1000
* Total value of the valuable cards: $4000 + $1000 = $5000

**3. Calculate the value of the additional cards:**

* Number of additional cards: 30
* Value of each additional card: $50
* Total value of additional cards: 30 * $50 = $1500

**4. Calculate the total value of all his cards:**

* Total value: $5000 + $1500 = $6500


**5. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit = Total value of cards sold - Total cost of packs
* Profit = $6500 - $5400 = $1100




{The final answer is $1100}<end_of_turn><eos>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500
So all the cards together are worth 1500+4000+1000=$<<1500+4000+1000=6500>>6500
The cost for the cards was 1800*3=$<<1800*3=5400>>5400
So he made a profit of 6500-5400=$<<6500-5400=1100>>1100

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost at the first park:**

*   Adult Cost: 2 adults * $26/adult = $52
*   Child Cost: 2 children * $12/child = $24
*   Total Cost at First Park: $52 + $24 = $76

**2. Calculate the cost at the second park:**

*   Adult Cost: 2 adults * $14/adult = $28
*   Child Cost: 2 children * $10/child = $20
*   Total Cost at Second Park: $28 + $20 = $48

**3. Determine the savings:**

*   Savings: $76 - $48 = $28


{The final answer is $28} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

old cost per tomato: $0.50
new cost per tomato: $0.40
Therefore, the new cost per tomato is less.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Identify the variables:**
   * Current cost per tomato: $0.50
   * New cost per tomato: $0.40 
   * Current daily tomato sales: 500 tomatoes

2. **Calculate the weekly cost:**
   * Weekly cost = (Daily cost per tomato) * (Number of days in a week)
   * This means we know the cost for 7 days

3. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   * Weekly savings = (Old cost per tomato) - (New cost per tomato)

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Identify the given information:**

* **Initial groups:** 6 groups
* **Required groups:** 12 groups
* **Students:** 54 students 

**2. Determine the size of each group:**

* We know 54 students need to be divided into 6 groups.
* Each group should contain the same number of students. 
*  To find the size of each group, we divide the total students by the number of required groups.
*  54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

**3. Calculate the difference in required groups:**

*  We need to find the number of extra groups needed.
*  Difference =  Required groups - Initial groups
*  Difference = 12 groups - 6 groups 
*  Difference = 6 groups

*
**Step 1: Convert dozen into individual items.**
 
*A dozen is equal to 12 items.* 

*So, 8 dozen glasses = 8 * 12 = 96 glasses*.

*Similarly, 4 dozen plates = 4 * 12 = 48 plates*

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of glasses and plates initially.**

 *Jeff initially has 96 glasses and 48 plates.*


**Step 3: Calculate the total number of broken items.**

*10 glasses broken + 6 plates broken = 16 broken items.*


**Step 4: Determine the remaining number of each item.**


* Jeff has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses remaining*.
 
* Jeff has 48 - 6 = 42 plates remaining*.

*The final answer is*:{86 glasses and 42 plates}

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Understand the relationship:**

* The regulation passed with twice as many votes in favor as against it.

**2. Set up variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the number of votes against the regulation. 
*  The number of votes in favor is then '2x'.

**3.  Work with the total votes:**

* The total number of votes cast must equal the number of people on the council.
* Therefore,  x + 2x = 33 

**4. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3x = 33
* Divide both sides by 3: x = 11 

**5. Find the number of votes in favor**

*  The number of votes in favor is 2x.
* Substitute the value of x:  2 * 11 = 22

 


**6. The final answer:** 
The final answer is 22.<end_of_turn><eos>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.
Thus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.
Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

Here's how we can break down the problem to find the solution:

**1. Figure out the number of students needing each size:**

* **Extra-small:** 11 students
* **Size Small:** Twice the number of extra-small: 11 * 2 = 22 students
* **Size Medium:** 4 less than the number of size small students:  22 - 4 = 18 students
* **Size Small:** 22 students 
* **Size Medium:** 18 students
* **Size Large:** Half the size of medium students: 18 / 2 = 9 students
*  **Size Extra-large:** 6 more than size large students: 9 + 6 = 15 students

**2.  Calculate the total number of students:**

* Total students: 11 + 22 + 18 + 22 + 9 + 15 = 99 students

**3.  Determine the total number of shirts ordered:**

*  **Extra-small:** 11 students * 1 shirt per student = 11 shirts

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:**

1. **Calculate Ava's allowance:**
    *  Ava's allowance is $90.
    *  Jayden received half of Ava's allowance.
    *  Jayden received $90 / 2 = $45.

2. **Calculate how much Jayden has:**
    *  Jayden starts with $70.
    *  Jayden received $45 from Ava.
    *  Jayden's total is $70 + $45 = $115.

3. **Calculate how much more is needed:**
    *  The camera costs $200.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1.  Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of cases needed for the second house. 
* The third house will need double the first house's amount, so it will need 2x cases.



**2. Set Up the Equation:** 

* The total number of cases needed is the sum of the cases needed for the first, second, and third houses. 
* Total cases = cases for the first + cases for the second + cases for the third.
* This gives us the equation: x + (1/2)x + 2x = 250

**3. Solve for x:**

* Combine like terms: 3.5x = 250
* Divide both sides by 3.5 to isolate x: x = 71.43

**4. Determine the number of cases for the third house:**

* Substitute the value of x back into the equation for the third house: 2 * 71.43 = 142.86


**5.  Answer the Question:**

* The third house will need 142.86 cases of shingles {The final answer is 142.86 }.



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house
The first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles

                    To ? make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. How much money would Sam have to spend to make 4 liters of juice?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**Step 1: Determine the cost per liter of juice.**

*  Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice. 
*  We know each kilogram costs $3. 
*  Therefore, 1 kilogram of oranges costs $3
*  To find the cost for 1 liter of juice, we multiply the cost per kilogram by the number of kilograms.  
 
*Cost per liter = $3/kg * 1 kg = $3*

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 4 liters of juice**

*  We need to multiply the cost per liter by the number of liters that needed.  
*  Total cost for 4 liters = $3/liter * 4 liters = $12

{The final answer is $12} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.
If one kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.

{The final answer is}

**Solution:**
1. **Find the number of books Ahmed read:**
    - Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed.
    - Therefore, Ahmed read  books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Ezra read:**
   - Ezra read 300 books in one hour. 
   - He decided to read 150 more. 
   - Ezra's total reading: 300 + 150 = 450 books. 

3. **Find the total number of books Ahmed read**
   - Ahmed read x books. 

4. **Combine Ezra's and Ahmed’s total number of books read:**
   - Total books read by Ezra: 450 books
   - Total books read by Ahmed: x books
   - Together, they read 450 + x books.


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450
Since Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed has read 450/2=<<450/2=225>>225 books.
Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books

**Here's a step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate earnings for Monday:**
   - Hours taught on Monday: 5 hours
   - Normal earnings per hour: $15
   - Earnings for Monday: 5 hours * $15/hour = $75

2. **Calculate earnings for Wednesday:**
   - Hours taught on Wednesday: 2 hours
   - Normal earnings per hour: $15
   - Earnings on Wednesday: 2 hours * $15/hour = $30

3. **Calculate earnings for additional classes on Monday:**
   - Number of classes on Monday: 4 classes 
   - Additional earnings: $5/class 
   - Earnings from additional classes on Monday: 4 classes * $5/class = $20

4. **Calculate earnings for additional classes on Wednesday:**
   - Number of classes on Wednesday: 2 classes 
   - Additional earnings: $5/class
   - Earnings from additional classes on Wednesday: 2 classes * $5/class = $10

5. **Calculate the total earnings for both days:**
   - Total earnings: $75 + $30 + $20 + $10 = $135

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**1. Calculate Bennet's earnings from eggplants:**

* He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each: 20 * $3 = $60

**2. Determine the amount needed from corn sales:**

*  He wants to make a total of $135: $135 - $60 = $75

**3. Calculate the price per ear of corn needed:**

* He needs to earn $75 from corn sales. 
* He has 25 ears of corn


{The final answer is} 
 <end_of_turn><eos>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $<<75/25=3>>3

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

**1. Calculate how many pencils Anthony gave to Brandon:**

* (1/2) * 50 pencils = 25 pencils

**2. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving to Brandon:**

* 50 pencils - 25 pencils = 25 pencils

**3. Calculate how many pencils Anthony gave to Charlie:**

* (3/5) * 25 pencils = 15 pencils

**4. Calculate the number of pencils Anthony had left after giving to Charlie:**

* 25 pencils - 15 pencils = 10 pencils

**5. Identify how many pencils Anthony kept:**

* 10 pencils 


{The final answer is 10 pencils} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils
So, there were 50 -25 = <<50-25=25>>25 pencils left.
Charlie got 25 x 3/5 = <<25*3/5=15>>15 pencils.
Thus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the number of series movies:**

*  A third of 600 movies = (1/3) * 600 = 200 movies

**2. Calculate the number of remaining movies:**

*  Total movies - series movies = remaining movies
*  600 - 200 = 400 movies

**3. Calculate the number of older movies:**

*  40% of 400 movies = 0.40 * 400 = 160 movies


**4. Calculate the cost of series movies:**

* Cost of series movies = $6/movie * 200 movies = $1200

**5. Calculate the cost of older movies:**

* Cost of older movies = $5/movie * 160 movies = $800

**6. Calculate the total cost of all movies:**

* Total cost = cost of series movies + cost of older movies
*  Total cost = $1200 + $800 = $2000

* Let 'A' represent Ava's score.
* Let 'E' represent Emma's score.
 

**2. Break Down Ava's Score Components**

* Enemies jumped on: 8 more than Emma, so A = 8E 
* Berries collected: 3 more than Emma, so A = 3 + 3E 

**3. Break Down Emma's Score Components**

* Enemies jumped on:  We don't need to calculate this differently 
* Berries collected: 3 more than Ava, so E = 3 + 3A 


 
**4. Calculate Completion Time** 

* Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so her finish time = 4 seconds delay.
* 
*


**5. Determine the Difference**

* Final Steps to Calculate the Difference
   *  Set up an equation to show that Ava's time = 4 seconds + Emma's time


**6.  Explain the Difference**



{The final answer is} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Identify the known information.**

* We know the total cost of the pizzas is $64.
* We know two pizzas cost $30.

**Step 2:   Represent the known information with an equation.**

Let  'x' be the cost of each of the other two pizzas.  

This sets up the equation: 2x + 30 = 64

**Step 3: Solve the equation for x.**

* Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation: 
   2x = 34

*Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   x = 17 


**Step 4: State your answer.**

The cost of each of the other two pizzas is $17.  {The final answer is $17.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The other two pizzas cost 64-30 = <<64-30=34>>34 dollars.
Each of the other two pizzas cost 34/2 = <<34/2=17>>17 dollars each.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We need to find how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week.
* They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days in a row.
* But some other days, they ride twice as much as usual.
  
**2. Break Down the Information:**

* **Usual Cycling:**  They ride their bikes three times a day for five days, that's 3 * 5 = 15 rides.
* **Twice Usual**:  They ride twice as much as usual which implies 15 * 2 = 30 rides for two other days.

**3. Calculate Total Rides:**

* **Total Rides in a week:** 15 rides + 30 rides = 45 rides


**The final answer is: 45** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each person rides his bike 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 times for 5 days.
Together, they ride 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 times for five days.
Each person rides his bike 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 times for every day of the other two days.
This means each person rides 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 times on each day of the other two days.
The total for the other two days is 12+12 = <<12+12=24>>24
For the whole week the together ride 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 times

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Initial Fish Count:** 

* Start with Bob's initial fish population: 7 fish.
* Orange fish: 3 fish
* White fish: 4 fish. 

**2. Fish Bought from the Pet Store**
* Salesman gave Bob 17 new fish.

**3. Calculated Total After Acquiring New Fish**
* The total number of new fish is 17.
* New fish includes both orange and white.

**4. Determining the Number of Orange Fish:**
* We know that Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
* 17 new fish includes a mix of orange and white. 

**5. Finding the Number of Orange Fish:**
* We have a new relationship between orange and white fish. 


{The final answer is 4}<end_of_turn><eos>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Given Information**

* **Fuel efficiency:** 10 MPG (this means how many miles a car can cover with 1 gallon of gas)
* **Gas price:** $3 per gallon
* **Distance:** 5 miles one way for the commute

**2. Calculate fuel consumption per week**

* **Daily fuel consumption:**  (10 MPG) * (Distance /  Week)
* **Note:** We need to find the daily fuel consumption.

**3. Determine the weekly fuel consumption**

* **Multiply daily fuel consumption by the number of days the car is used for work**
 


Let me know if you'd like more detail on any of the steps! 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

Here's how we can solve this step by step:

**1. Calculate the value of the quarters:**

* There are 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. 
* The total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35

**2. Calculate the value of the twenties:**

* She spent 3/5 of her twenties, so she spent (3/5) * 10 twenties = 6 twenties.
* The value of each twenty is $2.
* The total value of her spent twenties is 6 * $2 = $12


**3. Calculate the total amount spent:**

*  The total amount spent on lunch is $35 (from the quarters) + $12 (from the twenties) = $47


{The final answer is $47} 
 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35
She also used 3/5*10 = <<3/5*10=6>>6 of the twenties to pay for the lunch.
The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the known information:**

* John has $50. 
* The school will cover half the cost, which means they will contribute $50 / 2 = $25. 
* The total trip cost is $300.

**2. Determine the cost John is responsible for:**

* The contribution from the school is $25.
* To find out how much he needs, subtract the school's contribution from the total trip cost. 
   
   Total cost - School's contribution = John's cost

**3. Calculate John's needed amount:**

* $300 - $25 = $275

 
**4.  Answer the question:**

John is missing $275 {The final answer is $275}  
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

**1. Understand the problem:**

* Carson's house will freeze if the temperature drops below 32 degrees. 
* Wood burning warms the house by 5 degrees.
* The temperature drops 33 degrees from day to night.

**2. Calculate the temperature at night:**

* Day temperature: 45 degrees 
* Night temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

**3. Determine the temperature difference:**

* The temperature difference between day and night is 12 degrees.


**4.  Determine the heat needed:**

* The house needs to be warmed by 5 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. 


**5. Find the number of logs needed:**

* Using 5 degrees of heat for every log
* So, we need to know how many logs will warm the house to 32 degrees. This means we need a number of logs that would bring it up to 32 degrees.

                    Let's solve this step by step!

**Step 1: Calculate the discount**

* The discount is 25% of the original price
*  Discount = 0.25 * $40 = $10

**Step 2:  Calculate the sale price**

* Sale price = Original price - Discount
* Sale price = $40 - $10 = $30

**Step 3: Calculate the amount left over**

* Amount left over = Sale price - Payment
* Amount left over = $30 - $50 = -$20

**Step 4: Answer the question** 
 {The final answer is - $20}




<end_of_turn><eos>","The jeans cost $40 and are sale for 25% off so 40 * .25 = $<<40*.25=10.00>>10.00 discount
Take the original cost of the jeans and subtract the discount so 40-10 = $<<40-10=30.00>>30.00
Mike pays with a $50 bill and the final cost of the jeans is $30 so 50-30 = $<<50-30=20.00>>20.00 left

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of employees added each month:**
    * The company adds 20 new employees each month.

2. **Calculate the total number of employees after three months:**
    *  Total employees = Initial employees + (employees added per month * Number of months)
    * Total employees = 200 + (20 * 3) 
    * Total employees = 200 + 60
    * Total employees = 260

3. **Calculate the total amount paid to each employee per month:**
    * Each employee is paid $4,000 per month.

4. **Calculate the total amount paid to all employees per month:**
    * Total salary payment = Total employees * Salary per employee
    * Total salary payment = 260 * 4000
    * Total salary payment = 1,040,000


{The final answer is $1,040,000}     

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
    * Let 'P' represent the number of points Pierson scored.
    * Let 'N' represent the number of points Nikita scored.

2. **Write an Equation:**
    * Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. 
    * This translates into the equation: N = (P/2) + 11 

3. **Use Given Information:**
    * We know P = 278.

4. **Solve for N:**
    * Substitute P = 278 into the equation N = (P/2) + 11:
       * N = (278/2) + 11
       * N = 139 + 11
       * N = 150

5. **Calculate Total Points:**
    * Find the total points by adding Pierson's points and Nikita's points:  
       * Total Points = P + N
       * Total Points = 278 + 150
       * Total Points = 428 {The final answer is 428.}

*Please explain each step*

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Identify the key information**

* **Students:** Each child plants a tree, so there are 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students planting trees.
* **Teachers:** Each teacher plants 2 trees.
* **Total Teachers:**  3 teachers/class * 40 classes = 120 teachers.
 

**2. Calculate Total Trees Planted by Students** 
 * 1000 students * 1 tree/student = 1000 trees

**3. Calculate Total Trees Planted by Teachers** 
* 120 teachers * 2 trees/teacher = 240 trees


**4. Add the Trees Planted by Students and Teachers**
* 1000 trees + 240 trees = 1240 trees

**5. Final answer** {The final answer is 1240 trees.}


<end_of_turn><eos>","40 classes participate in the campaign, representing a total of 40 * 25 = <<40*25=1000>>1000 students.
With 3 teachers per class, 40 * 3 = <<40*3=120>>120 teachers participate.
With one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.
With 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.
Adding the trees planted by teachers and students, 1000 + 240 = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees will have been planted at the end of the campaign.

If she wants to buy , enough stuffed goats, such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all of her stuffed animals, how many stuffed goats should she buy?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the total number of stuffed animals:**

*   Start with the number of each type of stuffed animal: 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs.
*   Add these numbers together: 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

**2. Determine the number of stuffed goats needed**

*   Calculate 30% of the total number of stuffed animals.
*   30% = 0.30 (This can be converted from decimal form to percentage form in the step)
*   Multiply the total number of animals by the percentage of stuffed goats: 14 * 0.30 = 4.2 

 **3. Round up to the nearest whole number:**

*   Since we need to buy at least one more stuffed goat.


**Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.** 



{The final answer is 5} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate hours played in two weeks**
* Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks.
* One week has 7 days. 
* Total days for two weeks is 2 weeks * 7 days/week = 14 days
* Hours played in two weeks: 14 days * 0.5 hours/day = 7 hours

**Step 2: Calculate hours played in a week**
* Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week.
* Total hours played in a week: 7 hours/week * 7 days/week = 49 hours 

**Step 3: Determine remaining hours**
* Total hours needed for the achievement: 30 hours
* Hours already played: 7 hours + 49 hours = 56 hours
* Remaining hours: 30 hours - 56 hours = -26 hours 


**Step 4: Provide clarification:**
* We get a negative number for remaining hours.
* Kris has already played more hours than needed to reach the achievement. 



{The final answer is: Kris has already reached the achievement }

<end_of_turn><eos>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define Variables:**

*  Let  *x* represent the distance (in miles) between the two cars after 2 hours.
   
**2.  Set Up the Equation:**

*  The first car travels for 2 hours at 60 mph. This means it travels a distance of 2 * 60 = 120 miles.
*  The second car also travels 2 hours, and its speed is 70 mph. So, it will cover a distance of 2 * 70 = 140 miles.
*  The difference in distance traveled is key to finding the solution.


**3. Combine Known Information:**

*  The difference in distance is the sum of the distances each car has traveled. 
   
{The final answer is} 140 - 120 = 20 miles. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.
Thus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.

Here's how we can solve this problem:
 
 **1. Calculate the pass rate for each grade level:**

* **Third Grade:** (340 / 500) * 100% = 68%
* **Fourth Grade:** (40 / 100) * 100% = 40%
 
 **2. Determine the fifth grade's pass rate:**

*  The fifth grade pass rate was twice the fourth grade's, so let's calculate this:  2 * 40% = 80%

**3. Calculate the overall pass rate of the school:**

*  To find the overall pass rate, we add the pass rates of each grade level .
*  Overall pass rate = 68% + 40% + 80% = 188%

 
{The final answer is 188% } 




<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4
Then double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8
Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students
Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%

**2. Calculate the total number of chips needed:**

*The mosaic is three inches tall, so the tiles are three inches high. 
* Each inch of the mosaic requires twelve chips so the area of a single square inch is 12 glass chips. 

**3. Calculate the total number of chips needed for the whole mosaic.**


The area of the mosaic we calculated earlier is the total area.

**4. Find the total number of chips.**
* We know that each bag has 72 chips and Milo has two bags.
* The total number of chips is 72 chips/bag * 2 bags = 144 chips.

**5. Calculate the length of the mosaic.**

* Now that we have the total number of chips, we can calculate the area. 


**6. Convert the area of the mosaic into inches.**



* This conversion uses the chip data to determine the final answer.



{The final answer is 36 inches. } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' be the number of gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.

**2.  Set up a System of Equations:**

*  We know the total tea remaining is 10 quarts. 
*  4 students * 1.5 quarts = 6 quarts of tea drunk 
*  16 students * 2 quarts = 32 quarts of tea drunk
*  Therefore: `x - 6 - 32 = 10`

**3. Solve for x:**

*  Combine constants: `x - 38 = 10`
*  Add 38 to both sides: `x = 48`


**4. Answer:**

{The final answer is 48 gallons} 



Let me know if you need clarification on any of the steps. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts

Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons

{The final answer is}

 


**Solution:**
*   **Step 1:** Dale starts with 100 candies.
*   **Step 2:** He sells 150 candies, leaving him with 100 - 150 = -50 candies.
*   **Step 3:** He orders 100 more candies, bringing his total to 100 + 100 = 200.
*   **Step 4:** So, Dale still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies to finally sell all.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine the growth pattern:**

* The number of students doubles at the end of every month. This means the growth is exponential.

**2. Calculate the number of students after each month:**

* **Beginning of January:** 10 students 
* **End of January:** 10 * 2 = 20 students
* **Beginning of February:** 20 students
* **End of February:** 20 * 2 = 40 students
* **Beginning of March:** 40 students
* **End of March:** 40 * 2 = 80 students
* **Beginning of April:** 80 students
* **End of April:** 80 * 2 = 160 students
* **Beginning of May:** 160 students

**3. Find the total number of students after May:**

* The number of students after May is 160.


To answer the question, we need to:

* **Start with:** 10 students at the beginning of the year. 
* **Calculate:** The number of students after each month
* **Calculate:** The number of students after May. 




{The final answer is 160}<end_of_turn><eos>","At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20
At the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40
By the end of March, the number of students doubles to 2*40=<<2*40=80>>80
By the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160
At the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320
If there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understanding the Information**

* Felix charges kids based on the height of the branches he needs to climb.
* Each branch up costs $0.25.
* Felix made $105 during the week.  
 
**Step 2: Finding the Earnings Per Branch**

* We know Felix earned $105 over a week. 
* We need to find the earnings per branch (we don't know the number of sessions, just the number of branches).

**Step 3: Calculating the Average Cost**

* Average earnings per branch would equal total earnings divided by the number of branches.

Here's how we can break down this problem:

**1. Calculate total marshmallows used:**

* John's marshmallows used: 9 s'mores * 1 marshmallow/s'more = 9 marshmallows
* DeSean's marshmallows used: 9 s'mores * 1 marshmallow/s'more = 9 marshmallows 
* Total marshmallows used: 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows

**2. Calculate the number of marshmallows left:**

* Initial marshmallows: 35
* Marshmallows used: 18
*  Marshmallows remaining: 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows

**3.  Calculate marshmallows per S'more:**

* Each s'more uses 1 marshmallow.

**4.  Find out how many S'mores each kid can make:**

* Each kid has 17 marshmallows
* So, each kid can make 17/1 = 17 S'mores.




{The final answer is 17}<end_of_turn><eos>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

*
Solution:
1. **Define variables:** Let:
   *  `x` = amount of citrus zest
   *  `y` = amount of fragrance
   *  `z` = amount of salt
   *  `w` = amount of sugar
   *  `o` = amount of oil
2. **Set up equations based on given information:**
   * ""She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance"":   x = y
   * ""She uses twice as much oil as salt"":   o = 2z
   * ""She uses the same amount of salt as sugar"":  z = w
   * ""She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar"":    x + y + z + w + o = 10
3. **Solve the system of equations:**
     * We only need one equation for the amount of oil.

{The final answer is 4 ounces}


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

* Provide a step by step explanation. 

## Step-by-Step Solution 

**1. Find the number of cars Joe has:**
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20. 
   - Joe has 2 * 20 = 40 cars. 

**2. Calculate the number of cars sold:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - (20/100) * 40 = 8 cars.

**3. Calculate the number of cars given to Robert's mother:**
   - Joe gives twice as many cars as he sells to his mother.
   - 8 cars * 2 = 16 cars.

**4. Determine the number of cars Joe has left after selling and giving to his mother:**
   - Start with Joe's initial number of cars: 40 car.
   - Subtract the cars sold: 40 - 8 = 32 cars
   - Subtract the cars given to Robert's mother: 32 - 16 = 16 cars


**5. Final answer:**
 {The final answer is 16} 

 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.
He then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.
After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.
Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.
The number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16

She also walked ! half as many hours on the second ? day : as she walked : on the ! first day, to ; Hollock valley shores. Calculate the total ? time Sandy took to walk . in the two days in . minutes.<end_of_turn>


Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Identify the given information:**

* Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.
* On the second day, Sandy walked half as long as on the first day. 

**2. Find the time Sandy spent on the second day:**

*  Half as many hours as on the first day is equal to 8 hours / 2 = 4 hours. 

**3. Calculate the total time spent walking:**

* Total time = Time on day 1 + Time on Day 2 
* Total time = 8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

**4. Convert hours to minutes:**

* 1 hour = 60 minutes
* Total time in minutes = 12 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes.


{The final answer is 720 minutes} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.
The total time Sandy walked in the two days is 8+4 =<<8+4=12>>12 hours.
Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, Sandy walked for 12*60 = <<12*60=720>>720 minutes in the two days.

*Note* 
*The question could be worded more clearly*


**Solution:**

1. **Start with the initial count:**  Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered the school parking lot. 
2. **Add the cars during the first break:** During the first break, 20 more cars were in the parking lot, bringing the total to 50 + 20 = 70 cars.
3. **Calculate the number of cars that left during lunch:** 1/2 the number of cars are gone, so we need to find that half. (70 cars / 2 = 35 cars).
4. **Determine the total number of cars after the lunch break:** 35 cars left the parking lot.


**The final answer is : 35.**    
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1.  Calculate total tasks per day:**

*   He does 30 cycles/day * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks/day

**2. Calculate total earnings per day:**

*   He earns 150 tasks/day * $1.20/task = $180/day

**3. Calculate total earnings for a full week:**

*   He earns $180/day * 7 days/week = $1260/week

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total number of cat food tins:**

* Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food

**2. Calculate the total number of dog food tins:**

* Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food

**3. Find the difference between the number of cat food tins and dog food tins:**

* 88 tins (cat food) - 36 tins (dog food) = 52 tins


**The final answer is:** 52 tins of cat food 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

 variables: 
 * p = number of cards PJ has
 * s = number of cards Smendrick has 
 * b = number of cards Becca has
 

**Step 1: Set up equations based on the given information**

 We will use variables  to represent the number of cards each person has:
 *  b = p + 12  (Becca has 12 more than Smendrick)
 * s = 3p  (Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has)
 * b + s + p = 341 ( The total number of cards is 341)

 **Step 2: Solve for PJ's cards**

 We know that s = 3p, therefore we can substitute this into our equation.

* b + 3p + p = 341

We can simplify:
* b + 4p = 341

**Step 3: Solve for Becca's cards**

 We can use our equations from Step 1 to substitute and solve for Becca's cards.

* b = p + 12 
* b + 4p = 341 

 * b + 4p = 341
 * b = p + 12
 
 * Plug b from Step 2 in Step 3
* (p + 12) + 4p = 341


**Step 4: Continue Solving for PJ's Cards**

 * Simplify by combining terms. 
 * Solve for p


**Step 5: Solving for Becca's cards**

   * Substitute the value for p from Step 4 into the equation for b.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Identify the types of eggs Cindy has:**

* **Green:** 5
* **Blue:**  Twice the number of green eggs, so 5 * 2 = 10 
* **Pink:** One less than blue, so 10 - 1 = 9
* **Yellow:** One-third the number of pink eggs, so 9 / 3 = 3

**2. Calculate the total number of each egg type:**

* **Green:** 5
* **Blue:** 10
* **Pink:** 9
* **Yellow:** 3

 


**3. Calculate the total number of eggs:**

* 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27


{The final answer is 27} 
 




<end_of_turn><eos>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.
She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.
And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.

Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total shipping costs.** 

*   **Pound charges:** 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40
*   **Mile charges:** 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60
*   **Total shipping cost:** $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

**Step 2: Calculate the amount Amazon will refund.**

*   **Refund percentage:** 75%
*   **Total cost:** $32
*   **Refund amount:** $32 * 0.75 = $24

**Step 3: Calculate the book's final price for Milly.**

*   **Final price:** $32 - $24 = $8

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost Milly will pay.**

*   **Final cost:**  $3.00 (shipping) + $8 = $11.00


**Step 5: Determine Milly's total loss.**


*   **Total cost:** $11.00
*   **Refund amount:** $24 (from Amazon)
*   **Final cost Milly will pay:** $11.00


**The final answer is:** Milly will lose $13.00

* The problem can be broken down step by step. 
* Show the calculations for each step.


Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1:  Calculate initial amount.**

* Mulan starts with $40.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount from her father.**

* Her father gave her $100.
* Initial amount + gift = total amount

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the jeans.**

* Two pairs of jeans cost $30 each, therefore $30 x 2 = $60

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**

* The jeans cost $60 and the bag cost $20.
* Total cost = $60 + $20 = $80.

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining money.** 

* Total amount - total cost = remaining amount. 

 The final answer is 


{The final answer is $40 - $80 = -$40} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.
Two pairs of jeans cost 2 x $30 = $<<2*30=60>>60.

The second week, , Boris only produces ; half as much as the first ? week. ; But, the third week, Boris produces three times as much as , the first week. ? How much ? does he produce the fourth week?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Determine the production of the second week:**
   - Boris produces half as much in the second week as the first week, so he produces 8,000 bars / 2 = 4,000 bars.

2. **Determine the production of the third week:**
   - Boris produces three times as much in the third week as the first week. So he produces 8,000 bars * 3 = 24,000 bars.

3. **Determine the total production for the first three weeks:**
   - He produces 8,000 bars + 4,000 bars + 24,000 bars = 36,000 bars.

4. **Determine the production of the fourth week:**
   - To find the fourth week production, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production (50,000 bars). 
   - 50,000 bars - 36,000 bars = 14,000 bars


{The final answer is 14,000 bars}

**Solution:**

1. **Convert time units:**  
   * Convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.
   * Convert 15 minutes to a fraction: 15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 1/4 hour

2. **Calculate the total time spent on non-TikTok activities:**
   * Time for song writing: 120 minutes
   * Time for makeup: 1/4 hour = 15 minutes
   * Total time for non-TikTok activities: 120 minutes + 15 minutes = 135 minutes

3. **Calculate the total time spent on TikTok activities in a week:**
    * Total weekly time on TikTok: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes

4. **Calculate the total time spent on TikTok activities in a month:**
   * Total time spent on TikTok: 72 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 288 minutes

5. **Subtract the total time spent on non-TikTok activities from TikTok time to get the time spent on TikTok:** 
    * Total TikTok time: 288 minutes
    * Time for non-TikTok activities: 135 minutes
   * Time spent on TikTok: 288 minutes - 135 minutes = 153 minutes

 
**The final answer is:** 153 minutes 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week

**Step 2: Setup Ratios**

* Roy's savings is 40% more than Anthony, so we can set up a ratio:  x = 1.40A (where 1.40 represents the 40% increase)
* Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so we can set up another ratio: A = E + $10
* Eva has saved $20.00, so:  E = $20

**Step 3: Solve for A**
 
  * Substitute the value of E in the ratio *A = E + $10*:

   * A = $20 + $10
   * A = $30


 **Step 4: Solve for x** 

* Substitute the values of A ($30) into the ratio *x = 1.40A*:
 
   * x = 1.40($30) 
   * x = $42

 **Final Answer is** :  x = $42


 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00
Roy has saved 40% more than his brother who has $30.00 so Roy has saved .40*30 = $12.00
All total, Roy has 12.00 more than his brother, so he has 12+30 = $<<12+30=42.00>>42.00

And Saskay can lift , a : mountain 12 times higher than ? Pompei . can.  If Pompei can ? lift a : mountain 1 inch, how high ? can Naruto lift . a . mountain, in . feet?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}


Here's a stepwise breakdown:

**1. Analyze the relationships:**

* **Naruto vs. Kagiyami:**  Naruto lifts 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
* **Kagiyami vs. Saskay:** Kagiyami lifts 4 times higher than Saskay.
* **Saskay vs. Pompei:** Saskay lifts 12 times higher than Pompei.

**2. Set up the foundation:**

We need to establish a common base to work with.  We know Pompei can lift 1 inch, which is 1/12 feet.

**3. Relate the heights in a simple equation:**

Let's represent the height of an unknown mountain as 'x'.  

-  **Naruto's lift:**  Naruto lifts 10 times the height of Pompei's mountain, so Naruto lifts 10 * (1/12) = 5/6 feet of the high mountain.

-  **The mountain's height relative to Naruto:**  The mountain height relative to Kagiyami's lift would be the proportion of the height that Naruto lifts over the amount of height Kagiyami can lift, or 5/6 of a mountain.

---



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the distance covered in the first part of the journey**

*  Speed = 8 miles per hour
*  Time = 4 hours
*  Distance = Speed * Time = 8 miles/hour * 4 hours = 32 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered in the second part of the journey**

*  Speed = 8 miles per hour
*  Time = 6 hours
*  Distance = Speed * Time = 8 miles/hour * 6 hours = 48 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance travelled**

*  Total Distance = Distance in part 1 + Distance in part 2
*  Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles


**The final answer is 80 miles** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.
After his rest, Mason traveled for another 6 hours, and since he was traveling at 8 miles per hour, he had traveled for 6*8 = <<6*8=48>>48 miles after the six hours.
For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the relationship between speed and time.**  The time taken to travel a distance is directly proportional to the speed at which the object is travelling. This means if we change the speed, the time changes accordingly.

2. **Determine the speed of a kangaroo.** We know it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cover a distance.  This information suggests that the speed of a kangaroo is the same as the distance covered in 18 hours.

3. **Calculate the speed of a turtle.** The turtles are traveling half the speed of a kangaroo.


4. **Determine the time taken by the turtles**
 We know that the number of turtles is four, and the speed of each turtle is half of a kangaroo.

 {The final answer is 36 hours.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of dishes Jada makes:** 
   - Jada makes twice as many dishes as Rory, and Rory makes 20 more than Kora.
   - Jada makes 2 * Rory's dishes.
   - We know Kora made 20 dishes.
   - Rory made 20 + Kora's dishes.
2. **Calculate the number of dishes Rory makes:**
   - Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora, so he made 20 + Kora's dishes 
   - Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes 
3. **Calculate the total number of dishes Jada, Rory, and Kora make.** 
   - We know Jada’s dishes are twice Rory’s dishes, so, Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 dishes 
    
{The final answer is 80} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Kora made 20 clay dishes, Rory made 20 clay dishes + 20 clay dishes = <<20+20=40>>40 clay dishes.
Jada made twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which totals 2 * 40 clay dishes = <<2*40=80>>80 clay dishes.
The total number of clay dishes made by the three is 80 from Jada + 40 from Rory + 20 from Kora = <<80+40+20=140>>140 clay dishes

* Show your steps of reasoning

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total discount Erika receives:** The new laptop cost $600, and the discount is $200, so the final price is $600 - $200 = $400. 

2. **Calculate Erika's total savings:** Erika has already saved money, we know this is a good deal. She has $150 from her part-time job, and $80 from her mom, so she has $150 + $80 = $230 saved.

3. **Calculate the final amount remaining** After the discount, she needs an extra $50 and has $230 saved, so $230 + $50 = $280.

4. **Determine the final amount Erika has in her purse:** Final answer is {Erika has $280 in her purse.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.

*Please provide a step-by-step solution.*



## Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Information:**
   * Adam wants to slice apples.
   * Large apples: can be sliced into 5 pieces.
   * Small apples: can be sliced into 3 pieces.
   * Number of large apples: 3
   * Number of small apples: 5
   * Number of slices Adam eats: 15.

2. **Calculate the total pieces from large apples:**
   * 3 large apples * 5 pieces/large apple = 15 pieces

3. **Calculate the total pieces from small apples:**
   * 5 small apples * 3 pieces/small apple = 15 pieces 

4. **Calculate the total pieces from all apples:**
   * 15 pieces (large) + 15 pieces (small) = 30 pieces

5. **Determine the number of slices after Adam eats them:**
   * Adam eats 15 slices, and there are 30 total slices. 
   * Therefore, there are 30 – 15 = 15 slices left. 

** {The final answer is 15}**

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the components of the problem:**  
   - We need to find the total length of unused glue sticks.
   - We are given the remaining lengths of three glue sticks.

2. **Determine the lengths of the unused glue sticks:**
   - We can represent the lengths of the unused glue sticks as 'x'.

3. **Convert the given lengths of the partially used glue sticks into fractions of the original length:**
   - First glue stick: 1/6 of 12mm = 2mm
   - Second glue stick: 2/3 of 12mm = 8mm
   - Third glue stick: 1/2 of 12mm = 6mm

4. **Calculate the total length of the partially used glue sticks:**
   - 2mm + 8mm + 6mm = 16mm

5. **Subtract the total length of partially used glue sticks from the original length of each stick.**
   - First stick: 12 mm - 2 mm = 10mm
   - Second stick: 12mm - 8mm = 4mm
   - Third stick: 12mm - 6mm = 6mm



6.  **Combine the measurements together:**

*Please show all workings.*





Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Understanding the Relationships**

* **Socks:** Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and this is represented as:  Peter's Socks = 2 * Jack's Socks.
* **Dishes:** Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.  This is represented as: Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * Jack's Dishes.


**2.  Working with the Given Information**

* Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. 
* Jack collected 60 dishes.

**3.  Expressing the Known Relationships in Terms of a Variable**

 Let 'x' represent the number of socks Peter has.

We can express the information from each step as:

* Peter's Socks = 2 *  Jack's Socks
* Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * Jack's Dishes
* Jack's Socks = x


 **4.  Finding the Value of x (Number of Socks)**

* Jack's Dishes = 60 
* We know Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
* So,  Jack's Socks must be represented with 60 dishes/ 2.
* Therefore, Jack's Socks = 30.


**5.  Calculating the number of Socks**

* Peter's Socks = 2 * Jack's Socks
* Peter's Socks = 2 * 30 = 60



**6.   Calculating the total number of dishes** 

* Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * Jack's Dishes
* Peter's Dishes = 0.5 * 60 = 30
*


**7.  Final Answer**



{The final answer is 60 socks and 30 dishes}
<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.
In total, he has 30+60 = <<30+60=90>>90 socks and dishes.
Peter has twice as many socks as jack which totals 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 socks.
He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.
The total number of socks and dishes they both have is 90+90 = <<90+90=180>>180

She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the ; stage. If ! she allows a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the , concert?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate total time for each group:**

* Stage setup: 2 minutes
* Performance: 6 minutes
* Stage exit: 2 minutes 
* **Total time for each group:** 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

**2. Calculate the total concert time:**

* Concert time: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

**3. Calculate the available time for groups:**

* Concert time (in minutes): 120 minutes
* Intermission : 10 minutes
* **Total available time for groups:** 120 - 10 = 110 minutes

**4. Calculate the number of groups that can perform:**

* Each group takes 10 minutes.
* **Number of groups:** 110 minutes / 10 minutes/group = 11 groups


{The final answer is 11} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* Brenda invests $300 in an interest-bearing scheme.
* The interest earned each year is 3/4 of the initial investment. 
* We need to find how much money Brenda will have after 3 full years.


**Step 2: Formula for Simple Interest**

The formula for simple interest is:

* **Interest = Principal x Rate x Time**
*  Where:
    *  Principal = the starting investment amount
    *  Rate = the interest rate (as a decimal)
    * Time = the number of years

**Step 3:  Calculate the Interest Earned in the First Year**

* **Principal:** $300
* **Rate** = 3/4 = 0.75 (converting to decimal)
* **Time:** 1 year

* **Interest in the first year:** $300 * 0.75 * 1 = $225

**Step 4:  Calculate the Balance After the First Year**

* **Balance after year 1:** $300 + $225 = $525

**Step 5: Calculate the Interest Earned in the Second Year**

* **Principal:** $525
* **Rate** = 0.75
* **Time:** 1 year

* **Interest in the second year:** $525 * 0.75 * 1 = $393.75
 
**Step 6: Calculate the Balance After the Second Year**  

* **Balance after year 2:** $525 + $393.75 = $918.75


**Step 7: Calculate the Interest Earned in the Third Year**

* **Principal:** $918.75
* **Rate** = 0.75
* **Time:** 1 year 

* **Interest in the third year:** $918.75 * 0.75 * 1 = $684.6875

**Step 8: Calculate the Total Balance After 3 Years**


 * **Balance after year 3:** $918.75 + $684.6875 = $1603.4375

**Final answer:** The final answer is { $1603.44 }



<end_of_turn><eos>","Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225
After 3 years, interest of $225*3 = $<<225*3=675>>675 has been accumulated
She now has a total of $300+$675 = $<<300+675=975>>975

Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the number of white shirts with collars.**

* Half of the white shirts have collars, meaning (1/2) * 40 = 20 white shirts have collars.

**Step 2: Find the number of white shirts without collars.**
 
*  Subtract the number of white shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts.
    *   40 - 20 = 20 white shirts without collars

**Step 3: Find the number of floral shirts with buttons.** 

* We're given that 20 floral shirts have buttons.

**Step 4: Find the number of floral shirts without buttons.**

* Subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts.
   *  50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts without buttons.

**Step 5: Determine the difference.**

*  Compare the number of floral shirts without buttons to the number of white shirts without collars.
   *30 - 20 = 10

**The final answer is: 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 white shirts have no collars.

2. **Calculate the number of trays:**
   * Number of trays = Total eggs / Capacity per tray
   * Number of trays = 900 / 30 = 30 trays

3. **Determine the earnings:**
   * Earnings per tray = Price per tray
   * Earnings per tray = $2.5/tray

4. **Calculate total earnings:**
   * Total earnings = Earnings per tray * Number of trays
   * Total earnings = $2.5/tray * 30 trays = $75

 Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Find the number of goats sold from Farm Y**

* Twice the number of goats from Farm Y is 10 goats * 2 = 20 goats. 

**Step 2: Calculate the total goats sold**

* The total goats sold from both farms is 10 goats + 20 goats = 30 goats


**Step 3: Find the number of goats remaining in Farm X**

* After selling 10 goats, there are 55 goats - 10 goats = 45 goats left in Farm X. 

**Step 4: Find the number of goats remaining in Farm Y**

*  We started with 45 goats in Farm Y and sold 20 goats, leaving 45 goats - 20 goats = 25 goats in Farm Y.

**Step 5:Calculate the total goats remaining**

* The total goats remaining are 45 goats + 25 goats = 70 goats


**The final answer is:**  70 goats 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.
Mr. Smith sold 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.
Thus, 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats are left in Farm Y.
Therefore, there are a total of 45 + 25 = <<45+25=70>>70 goats left in the two farms altogether.

This question requires breaking down the problem with some specific calculations. Let's start:


**Step 1: Identify Costs**

* **Green Food:** $25
* **Red Food:**  $18

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of red food after discount**

* **Discount per Red Basket:** $2
* **Cost of Red Basket after Discount:** $18 - $2 = $16

**Step 3:  Calculate the cost of buying 3 Green Food Baskets**
 

* **Cost of 3 Green food:** $25 x 3 = $75 


**Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying 3 baskets of red food**

* **Cost of 3 red baskets:** $16 x 3 = $48

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let 'b' represent the age of your brother.
*  Let 's' represent the age of your sister.
*  Let 'm' represent the age of your mom.
*  Let 'y' represent the age of you.

**2. Set Up Equations based on the given information:**

*  ""I am three years younger than my brother""  => b = y + 3
*  ""I am 2 years older than my sister""  => y = b - 2 
*  ""Mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age""  => m = 3b - 1

   -  Doubled flow rate after heavy rain
   -  Increased flow rate on the third day by 6000 gallons.


2. **Determine the volume of water flow in the second day after heavy rain:**
   - Doubled flow rate means new water flow rate is 2 * initial flow rate = 2 * 4000 gallons = 8000 gallons.
   - We have the flow rate for the second day.

3. **Calculate the water flow rate for the third day:**
   - Final flow rate after the third day is increased by 6000 gallons. 
   - New flow rate = initial flow rate + increase = 4000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 10000 gallons.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Define variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the amount of money Rafaela received in tips.
   * Let 'y' represent the amount of money Julieta received in tips.

**2.  Set up equations based on the given information:**
   *  ""Each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip.""  
     This translates to: x = 40 * $20 
   * ""Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela."" 
     This translates to: y = x - (0.10 * x)

**3. Solve for x:**
   *  x = 40 * $20 
   *  x = $800 

**4. Solve for y:**
   * y = x - (0.10 * x)
   * y = $800 - (0.10 * $800)
   * y =  $800 - $80
   * y = $720

**5. Calculate the total amount of tips:**
   * Total tips = x + y
   * Total tips = $800 + $720  
   * Total tips = $1520

{The final answer is $1520}



<end_of_turn><eos>","The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800
Julieta got 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, a total of 10/100*$800 = $<<10/100*800=80>>80
The total amount of money that Julieta received as tips is $800-$80 = $<<800-80=720>>720
Altogether, Julieta, and Rafaela received $720+$800 = $<<720+800=1520>>1520

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total number of loaves baked:** 
* Paige bakes loaves every hour.
* Time baked: 6:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 8 hours
* Total loaves baked: 8 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 16 loaves

**2. Calculate the total number of slices:**
* Each loaf has 8 slices. 
* Total slices: 16 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 128 slices

**3. Calculate the total earnings:**
* Each slice sells for $0.50
* Total earnings: 128 slices * $0.50/slice = $64.00

*To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the types of coins.* 

Let's break it down:

**1. Understanding the Given Information:**

* Gretchen has some coins.
* There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
* She had 70 gold coins.

**2. Setting up the Variables**

* Let 's represent the number of silver coins she has.
* Let 'g' represent the number of gold coins she has.

**3. Forming Equations:**

* We can use the information about the difference between gold and silver coins to make an equation. 
   *  g = s + 30   (This represents the relationship between the number of silver and gold coins) 

**4. Using the Given Information to Solve the Equations:**

* We know that g = 70.

* Substitute this value into the equation to find 's'
    * 70 = s + 30
    * 70 - 30 = s 
    * 40 = s

**5. Calculating the Total Number of Coins**

* Now we can calculate the total number of coins using the information we now have.
  * Total coins = silver coins + gold coins 
  * Total coins = 40 + 70
  * Total coins = 110


* {The final answer is 110}

Let's break down the answer step-by-step:

1. **Students receiving burritos:**
   - 50 students are at the picnic.
   - Each student gets 10 burritos.
   - Total burritos for students:  50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

2. **Burritos after students:**
   - Total burritos ordered: 600 burritos
   - Burritos given to students: 500 burritos
   - Leftover burritos: 600 burritos - 500 burritos = 100 burritos

3. **Burritos remaining for Mr. George:**
    - Mr. George eats 20 burritos. 
    - Leftover burritos: 100 burritos - 20 burritos = 80 burritos

{The final answer is 80}

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of green cars:**
    *  They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so they have  12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

2. **Determine the number of blue cars:**
    * They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars,  so they have 10 * 3 = 30 blue cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of green, red, and blue cars:**
    * They have 10 green cars + 12 red cars + 30 blue cars = 52 cars.

4. **Find the number of yellow cars:**

{The final answer is}

## Step-by-Step Solution 

1. **Define variables:** 
   - Let 'A' represent the number of books Anne has.
   - Let 'S' represent the number of books Sofie has.
   - Let 'F' represent the number of books Fawn has.

2. **Establish relationships using given information:**
  -  ""Sofie has 25 more books than Anne"" :  S = A + 25
  -  ""Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn"" : A = F - 12

3. **Combine equations to find Fawn's books:**
   - Substitute the second equation (A = F - 12) into the first equation (S = A + 25): 
     S = (F - 12) + 25
   - Simplify: 
     S = F + 13

   -  Use the total number of books combined as the starting point (85):
     S + A + F = 85
   - Substitute equations we have:
     (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85

   -  Combine like terms:
     3F + 1 = 85 

   -  Solve for F :
     3F = 84
     F = 28

 {The final answer is} 28  



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 48 / 3 = <<48/3=16>>16 books
Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1.  Calculate the portion of the cost that Madeline pays.**

* Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
* This means she pays 0.60 * $400 = $240 per month

**2. Calculate the portion of the cost that Keenan pays.**

* The total cost is shared equally, therefore, Keenan pays the remaining amount.
* The remaining portion is $400 - $240 = $160 per month.

**3. Calculate the weekly cost Keenan spends.**

* Keenan spends $160 / 4 weeks = $40 per week.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Relationships:**

* We know the cost of 7 soda bottles is $21.00.
* We know the cost of 4 water bottles is $8.00.
* We want to find the cost of 3 soda bottles and 2 water bottles.

**2. Set up a Proportion**

We can use proportions to calculate the cost of soda and water:

* **Proportion for Soda:**  (Price per bottle of soda) / (Number of bottles of soda)
* **Proportion for Water:** (Price per bottle of water) / (Number of bottles of water)


**3. Calculate the Price of a Single Bottle:**

*   **Soda:** $21.00 / 7 bottles = $3.00 per bottle.
*   **Water:** $8.00 / 4 bottles = $2.00 per bottle.

**4. Calculate the Total Cost:**

*  **Soda:** 3 bottles * $3.00/bottle = $9.00
*  **Water:** 2 bottles * $2.00/bottle = $4.00



**5.  Calculate final answer:** 


{The final answer is $13.00} 
 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.
Three bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.
One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.
Therefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bolts.**

*   Cost per bolt: $0.03
*   Number of bolts: 16
*   Total cost: $0.03 * 16 = $0.48

**Step 2: Determine the amount of money left.**

*   Initial amount: $12.48
*   Total cost of bolts: $0.48 
*   Money left: $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

**The final answer is:** $12.00 


<end_of_turn><eos>","David paid 16 * 0.03 = $<<16*0.03=0.48>>0.48 for the bolts.
David has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12 left.

Here's how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Find Ella's rate of earning.**

* She earns $33 for 3 hours. 
* This means she earns $33 / 3 hours = $11 per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate her earnings for 12 hours.**

*  She earns $11 per hour.
*  She will earn $11/hour * 12 hours = $132


**The final answer is: $132** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.
So for 12 hours of dog walking, Ella would earn $11 x 12 = $<<12*11=132>>132.

*You can use models and drawings if helpful*

**Solution**

1. **Start with the initial number of marbles:** Paul begins with 52 marbles. 

2. **Add the new marbles:** His friend gives him 28 more, so he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.

3. **Calculate how many marbles he lost:** He losses 1/4 of his total marbles, which is (1/4) * 80 = 20 marbles.

4. **Find the number of marbles remaining:**  His original amount minus his lost marbles equals the number he has left. So, 80 - 20 = 60 marbles.




**The final answer is 60 marbles.**<end_of_turn><eos>","Paul has a total of 52 + 28 = <<52+28=80>>80 marbles.
He lost 1/4 x 80 = <<80/4=20>>20 marbles.
Therefore, he has 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60 marbles left.

Here's how we can break down the solution:

**1. Calculate points from multiple-choice and true/false questions**

* **Multiple-choice:** 10 questions * 0.80 (80%) = 8 questions 
* **True/false:** 20 questions * 0.90 (90%) = 18 questions

**2. Calculate total points from multiple-choice and true/false questions**
*  8 questions * 1 point/question = 8 points
* 18 questions * 1 point/question = 18 points
*  Total: 8 + 18 = 26 points

 **3. Calculate points from long-answer questions**
* 5 questions * 5 points/question = 25 points

 

**4. Calculate total points**

* 26 points (multiple-choice & true/false) + 25 points (long-answer) = 51 points {The final answer is 51} 



Let me know if you'd like further clarification on any step! <end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points
Now add the points from the 1-point and 5-point questions: 26 points + 15 points = <<26+15=41>>41 points

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias is selling:**

*  3/5 of 300 chickens = (3/5) * 300 = 180 chickens

**2. Calculate the total earnings from selling the chickens:**

*  Price per chicken * Number of chickens = Earnings
* $50/chicken * 180 chickens = $9000

**3. Determine the cost of the chickens for Isaias**

* Profit = Total earnings - Cost of chickens.
* $2000 = $9000 - Cost of chickens

**4. Solve for the cost of the chickens:**

* Cost of chickens = Total earnings - Profit.
* Cost of chickens = $9000 - $2000 = $7000


**The final answer is: $7000**

Here's step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the known information:**
   * Total glasses sold: 32
   * Julie's sales: 14 glasses

2. **Determine the amount Micah and Mitchell sold:**
   *  If Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys sold an equal number, they shared the rest.
   *  Combined sales of Micah and Mitchell: 32 - 14 = 18 glasses

3. **Calculate how many glasses Micah and Mitchell sold:**
  * Since they sold an equal number: Mika and Mitchell sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses each.  

4. **Find the difference between Julie's and Micah's sales:**
  *  Julie's sales - Micah's sales = difference
  * 14 - 9 = 5


 {The final answer is 5}

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define the Costs:**

* **Hair:** $400 
* **Manicure:** We need to figure out how much that costs.
* **Pedicure:** We need to figure out how much that costs. 

**2. Manicure Cost:**

* Iris spent 1/4 of the hair cost on her manicure.
* This means  (1/4) * $400 = $100 for the manicure.

**3. Pedicure Cost:**

* Iris spent 3/4 of the manicure cost on the pedicure 
* This means (3/4) * $100 = $75 for the pedicure. 


**4. Total Spending**

* Add up the costs of the manicure, pedicure, and hair: $100 + $75 + $400 = $675{The final answer is $675}

This question requires a step-by-step solution, and here's how we can break it down:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  'x' be Melanie's current age.

**2. Set Up Equations**

* **Statement 1:** ""In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old."" This translates to:
    * x + 10 = 18

* **Statement 2:** ""In how many years will her age be thrice her present age?""  Let's translate this into an equation. We need to find how many years it takes for Melanie's age to be three times her current age.


**3. Solve for x**
* **Statement 1:**  x + 10 = 18
* **Solve for x:** 
    * x = 18 - 10 
    * x = 8  

**4. Determine the Time for Age to be Three Times Her Present Age**

* **Step 3** establishes that Melanie is currently 8 years old
* **We need to find the number of years until her age is three times her present age**
 

**Conclusion**



{The final answer is}

Here's the breakdown of the problem:

**1. Calculate the cost of the chicken:**

* Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so it costs 2 * $10 = $20.

**2. Calculate the cost of the strawberries:**

* A pack of strawberries costs $4, so 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 * $4 = $12.

**3. Calculate the cost of the apples:**

* A pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2 per pack.
* 7 packs of apples cost 7 * $2 = $14. 


**4. Calculate the total cost of all the items.**

*  Total cost = Cost of bacon + Cost of chicken + Cost of strawberries + Cost of apples.
*  Total cost = $10 + $20 + $12 + $14 = $56.

**5. Calculate how much money Kelly has left.**

*Kelly started with $65 and the items cost $56 so she has $65 - $56 = $9 left.


**The final answer is $9** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the variables:**
   * Let  'x' represent the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   * The final concert is twice as long as her usual concert, so it's 2 * x minutes long. 
   * The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes. 
   
   Therefore: 2x + 15 = 65

3. **Solve for 'x':**
   * Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:  2x = 50
   * Divide both sides by 2: x = 25

4. **Answer:** 


The final answer is {Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes} . 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.

                    question:
                    ! A singer has : 50 microphones that he wants ! to arrange ? in pairs ! on a , stage. : While ! making ; the ! arrangement, he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't find any ! space to fit in after , arranging the ? rest in ! pairs. ! How many pairs of microphones , was he ? able ? to . arrange ? on the stage?<end_of_turn>
{This problem could be solved using a few different approaches but we'll use a simple straightforward solution. }

**Step 1: Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit in pairs.**

* 20% of 50 microphones = (20/100) * 50 = 10 microphones

**Step 2: Calculate the number of microphones that will fit in pairs.**

* 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

**Step 3: Determine the number of pairs that can be formed.**

* 40 microphones / 2 microphones/pair = 20 pairs 



**The final answer is: 20 pairs of microphones. ** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10
This means the singer could set 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 microphones into pairs on the stage.
Since a pair has 2 microphones, the singer set up 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and the solution:

**Step 1: Figure out the number of birds flying overhead.**

*  Jerry counts 6 birds nesting.
*  2/3 of 6 birds is (2/3) * 6 = 4 birds.

**Step 2: Figure out the number of feeding groups.**

* Jerry has 3 feeding groups. 
* Each group has 8 birds.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds in flight.**

* There are 4 birds flying overhead.
 

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of birds feeding.** 
* There are 3 groups of 8 birds in total. 
    



**Step 5: Calculate the total number of birds**

Total birds = 6  + 4 + 3 * 8 = 6 + 4 + 24 
   Total birds = 34 




**Final Answer is: 34**<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many birds are flying overhead: 6 birds * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 birds

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Identify the key information:**
   * Joelle has 5 orchids.
   * Each orchid has 5 petals.
   * Joelle has 4 African daisies.
   * Each daisy has 10 petals.

2. **Formulate the comparison:**
   * We need to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.

3. **Calculate the difference in petals:**
   *  Daisies petals: 10

Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve this problem:

**1. Find the number of indoor plants:**

*  One-fourth of 100 plants is (1/4) * 100 = 25 indoor plants.

**2. Find the number of plants remaining after removing indoor plants:**

*  The number of plants remaining is 100 - 25 = 75 plants.

**3. Find the number of outdoor plants:**

* Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants, so 75 * (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants.

**4. Find the number of flowering plants:**

*  The remaining plants are flowering plants, so we subtract the number of indoor and outdoor plants to find the number of flowering plants.  
 *There are 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.

**5.  Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**

* To find the percentage, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and multiply by 100.
* (25 / 100) * 100 = 25%.



{The final answer is 25% } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Key Relationships:** 
   -  The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob.
   - The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob.
   - The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

2. **Translate Relationships into Equations:**
   - Let 'x' represent the speed of the thingamabob.
   - The whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob. So, its speed = 11x meters per second.
   - We know the whatchamacallit's speed = 121 meters per second.


3. **Solve for the Speed of the Thingamabob (x):**
   - We know the whatchamacallit's speed = 121 meters per second. 
   - We know the whatchamacallit's speed = 11 times the thingamabobs speed.
   - So, 11x = 121
   - Divide both sides by 11: x = 11

4. **Determine the Speed of the Whirligig:**
   - The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob.  
   - Therefore, the whirligig's speed = 5 * x = 5 * 11 = 55 meters per second.



 {The final answer is 55 meters per second.}

                    question:
                    Ellen , is on a diet. She eats two carrots, ? a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs her $6, while the yogurt is half the price. How much does Ellen pay for one carrot every day when in total she pays $11 ? for her . goods?<end_of_turn>


Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Determine the cost of the yogurt.** 
   - The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

**2.  Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt.** 
   -  Ellen pays a total of $11 for her food, including the salad and yogurt.
   -  So, the total cost is $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9.

**3. Determine the cost of the carrots.**
   - We know Ellen pays a total of $11 for her food.
   -  She pays $9 for the salad and yogurt. 
   -  Therefore, the cost of the carrots alone is $11 – $9  = $2.


**The final answer is $2. 



**Explanation:**

The problem involves a series of deductions to find the cost of the carrots. Each step relies on knowing the prices of the salad and yogurt, and from that, we can determine the cost of the carrots.  




<end_of_turn><eos>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate Mark's original weekly earnings:** 
   - He works 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week
   - His original hourly rate is $10/hour.
   - Original weekly earnings = 40 hours/week * $10/hour = $400/week

2. **Calculate his new hourly rate:**
   - His pay was increased by $2/hour
   - His new hourly rate = $10/hour + $2/hour = $12/hour

3. **Calculate his new weekly earnings:**
   -  He works 40 hours/week at the new rate of $12/hour
   - New weekly earnings = 40 hours/week * $12/hour = $480/week

4. **Answer:** {The final answer is } $480/week

*Note: This should be about calculating lemonade sales*


Here's the breakdown:
 
 **Understanding the Problem:**

*  We need to figure out Tasha's lemonade earnings.
* The problem gives information about lawn work and lemonade sales.
* We know the number of times Tasha mowed each person's lawn and the amount earned from each lawn.




**Step 1: Identify Tasha's Earnings from Lawn Work**

* Joe's lawn:  We know Tasha made $6 for mowing Joe's lawn
* Kamala's lawn: We need more information, like how many times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn. 
* Alba's lawn: We need more information.

**Step 2: Track how Many Times Tasha Mowed Kamala's and Alba's Lawn**

* We know Tasha mowed Joe's lawn thrice as many times as Joe did. 
* We need to know that number.
* We find out how many times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
* We will figure out how many times Tasha mowed Alba's lawn. 



**Step 3: Calculate Lemonade Earnings**


* We will use this information to calculate her final earnings.

**1. Understand the Relationship:**

* **Dijana's Distance:** Dijana rowed 50 miles for the whole day.
* **Anis's Distance:** Anis rowed 1/5 of Dijana's distance, meaning he rowed 50 miles * (1/5) 

**2. Calculate Anis's Distance:**

* Distance Anis rowed = (1/5) * 50 miles 
* Distance Anis rowed = 10 miles


**3. Find the Total Distance:**

* Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance.
* Total distance = 50 miles + 10 miles
* Total distance = 60 miles.



**The final answer is 60 miles.** <end_of_turn><eos>","Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**Step 1: Identify the starting amount**

* Susan begins with 100 cookies.

**Step 2: Determine the intended distribution**

* Susan wants to divide the cookies equally among her 6 nephews. This means she planned to give each nephew 100 cookies / 6 nephews = 16.67 cookies per nephew. 

**Step 3: Account for the husband's snacking**

* Her husband takes 4 cookies, leaving Susan with 100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies. 

**Step 4: Calculate the final amount per nephew**
* Since Susan reduces her cookies by 4, each nephew will receive 96 cookies / 6 nephews = 16 cookies.

   - Daniel didn't read any pages today.

2. **Formulate an equation:**  We need to find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel today.  This will help us answer our question.

   * Let 'x' represent the number of pages Daniel read yesterday.
   * Denise read 'x + 5' pages today.
   * Daniel read 0 pages today.
 
3. **Set up the equation based on the information:** 

   *  Denise's total for the two days = Denise's pages yesterday + Denise's pages today 
   *   = (10 + 5) pages
   *   = 15 pages

**4. Solve the equation:** 

* We know Denise's total pages for both days is 15.

{The final answer is 15}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Denise read 13 + 5 = <<13+5=18>>18 pages today.
She was able to read 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 pages in all.
So, Denise read 28 - 13 = <<28-13=15>>15 more pages than Daniel.

*Please show all your work.


**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of bowls and the capacity of the pot.** 
   * The pot can hold enough soup for four adult bowls or eight child's bowls.
   * This information directly informs us that there are different capacities. This is crucial to understanding the problem. 

2. **Set up the total capacity of the soup:**
    *  The question is unclear about the soup capacity.


3. **Calculate the number of bowls needed**:
   * We need to understand how many children are there. 


4. **Determine the number of meals**:
  *  We need to figure out how long the leftovers will last.


{ The final answer is } 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

let's break down the problem:

**Step 1:** Find the cost of the notebooks. 
   * Multiply the price per notebook by the number of notebooks.
   * Cost of notebooks = $1.50 x 5 = $7.50

**Step 2:** Find the cost of the ballpen.
   * Multiply the price per ballpen by the number of ballpens. 
   * Cost of ballpen = $0.50 x ?

**Step 3:**  Add the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen.
  *Total cost = Cost of notebooks + Cost of ballpen

**Step 4:** Fill in the missing value for the ballpen 
   * To get the final answer, we need to put in the cost of one ballpen.


**Final Answer:** {The final answer is $7.50 + $0.50 x ? } 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the six notebooks was 5 x $1.50 = $7.5.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the information:**
   * We need to find out how much material Jo needs for small masks and large masks. 
   * She uses 2 yards for small masks.
   * She uses 2.25 yards for large masks.
   * She wants to create 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

2. **Set up a plan:**
   * We need to figure out the total material needed for small masks and large masks separately.
   * We'll write equations based on the given information to solve for the overall amount of material needed.


3. **Calculate the material needed for small masks:**
   * We know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   * Divide the number of small masks by the number of yards needed per mask: 20 small masks / 4 masks/yard = 5 yards

4. **Calculate the material needed for large masks:**
   * We know that Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   * Divide the number of large masks by the number of yards needed per mask: 8 large masks / 3 masks/yard = 2.67 yards

 5. **Add the material needed for both types of masks:**
   * Add the amount of material needed for small masks and large masks: 5 yards + 2.67 yards = 7.67 yards.


6. **State the conclusion:**
   *  Jo would need 7.67 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class. {The final answer is 7.67 yards} .



<end_of_turn><eos>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.
It takes 2.25 yards of material / 3 large masks = <<2.25/3=0.75>>0.75 yards of material per mask.
For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.
In all, it will take 10 yards + 6 yards = <<10+6=16>>16 yards of material.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let Duncan's age eight years ago be represented by ""D"" 
* Let Adam's age four years ago be represented by ""A""

**2. Set up Equations based on Given Information:**

*  ""Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.""
   *  D = 2 * A - 4  (Equation 1)
*  ""Duncan's age is 60 now.""
   * D = 60 (Equation 2)

**3. Solve for Duncan's age eight years ago (D) using Equation 2:**
* Since D = 60 from Equation 2, we can substitute it into Equation 1.

**4. Solve for Adam's age four years ago (A) using Equation 1:**
*  60 = 2 * A - 4 
* Add 4 to both sides: 64 = 2 * A
* Divide both sides by 2:  A = 32


**5. Calculate Adam's age in 8 years:** 
* Adam's current age is A = 32, so in 8 years, he will be: 32 + 8 = 40 years old.



**6. Final Answer** 
 {The final answer is 40} <end_of_turn><eos>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

* **Thursday:** Bruce works 2 hours less than Wednesday's time.

**2. Calculate Wednesday's Work Time**

* Twice the time Bruce worked on Tuesday is: 5 hours * 2 = 10 hours

**3. Calculate Thursday's Work Time**

* Bruce works 2 hours less than Wednesday's time: 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

**4. Calculate Bruce's Total Work Hours**

* Total hours worked on Tuesday: 5 hours

Julia and Nadine's , mother give each one of them?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the cost of the balloons:**
   * Cost per balloon: $0.50 / 2 balloons = $0.25 per balloon
   * Cost of a dozen balloons: $0.25/balloon * 12 balloons = $3.00

2. **Calculate the total cost of the cake and balloons:**
   * Total cost: $11.00 (cake) + $3.00 (balloons) = $14.00

3. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream:**
   * Cost of one tub: $7.00
   * Cost of two tubs: $7.00 * 2 = $14.00

4. **Calculate the combined budget:**
   * Total cost: $14.00 (cake and balloons) + $14.00 (ice cream) = $28.00

5. **Calculate the amount of allowance each girl received:**
   * Since they combined their allowance to buy the items. The allowance was the amount to spent. 
   * Amount of allowance needed: $28.00 
   * Amount of allowance per girl: $28.00 / 2 = $14.00

 
{The final answer is $14.00}   




<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

*Explain each step clearly*


Here's the breakdown:

**1. Find the number of volleyball players.**

*  Start with the number of tennis players: 6 students
*  Multiply that number by 2 (because there are twice as many volleyball players as tennis players): 6 * 2 = 12 students

**2. Find the total number of students in soccer.**

*  Start with the number of boys: 16 boys
*  Add the number of girls: 22 girls
*  Total: 16 + 22 = 38 students

**3. Find the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball.**

*  Add the number of tennis players and volleyball players: 12 + 6 = 18 students

**4. Add all the students playing.**

*  Combine the soccer players, tennis players, and volleyball players: 38 + 18 = 56 students

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**

* Each student sold 10 lollipops.
* There are 30 students.
* Total lollipops sold = 10 lollipops/student * 30 students = 300 lollipops

**2. Calculate the total revenue earned:**

* Each lollipop cost $0.80.
* They sold 300 lollipops.
* Total revenue = $0.80/lollypop * 300 lollipops = $240

**3. Calculate the total cost of the lollipops:**

* Each lollipop cost $0.50.
* They bought 300 lollipops.
* Total cost = $0.50/lollypop * 300 lollipops = $150

**4. Calculate the profit:**

* Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
* Profit = $240 - $150 = $90

{The final answer is $90} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.
So each student raised $0.3 x 10 = $<<0.3*10=3>>3 from selling 10 lollipops.
Therefore, they were able to raise a total of $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.

{The final answer is}



**Solution:**

1. **Find Josh's slices per day**: Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats 2 slices/day * 2 = 4 slices/day.
2. **Calculate how many days the loaf lasts for Abby**: Abby eats 2 slices/day, so the loaf will last 24 slices / 2 slices/day = 12 days.
3. **Calculate how many days the loaf lasts for Josh**: Josh eats 4 slices/day, so the loaf will last 24 slices / 4 slices/day = 6 days.
4. **Compare the amount of time each manages to eat the bread for:**

    * Abby: 12 days

Here is the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cups per row.**

* Lana starts with 27 cups of tea.
* She divides these into 3 rows.
* So, each row has 27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups of tea.

**Step 2: Figure out how many cups of chamomile are in each row.**

* This is a trick question. 
*The number of cups of chamomile tea in each row is the same as the number of cups of mint tea in each row.


**Step 3: Determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row.**

* We determined that each row contains 9 cups of tea.
* Since she divides the tea evenly into chamomile and mint, she uses 9 cups / 2 = 4.5 cups of tea for chamomile and mint.

**Step 4: Final Answer**



 {The final answer is 4.5 cups} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

**1.  Calories of a Mini Cinnamon Roll**
   * We know a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
   * The mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd the calories of a normal one, so it has (1/3) * 600 calories = 200 calories.

**2. Calories of a Mini Blueberry Muffin**
   * A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
   * The mini muffin has 1/3rd the calories of a normal one, so it has (1/3) * 450 calories = 150 calories.

**3. Total Calories for Miniature Mini Pastries** 
   * To find the total calories for *all* the mini cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins, combine the calories of each.
   *  Total calories = (calories of mini cinnamon rolls) + (calories of mini blueberry muffins) 
   *  Total calories = 200 calories + 150 calories = 350 calories


 {The final answer is 350} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = <<200*200=40000>>40000 calories
Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

1. **Identify the given information:** 
   * Monday: 39 Junebugs
   * Tuesday and Wednesday: Twice the amount from Monday, so 39 * 2 = 78 Junebugs
   * Thursday: 48 Junebugs
   * Friday: 57 Junebugs

2. **Calculate the total Junebugs removed for all days:**
   * Total Junebugs = 39 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 232 Junebugs

3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:** 
   * Average Junebugs/day = Total Junebugs / Number of days
   * Average Junebugs/day = 232 / 5 = 46.4 


**The final answer is 46.4** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs
All total she has removed 39+78+78+48+57 = <<39+78+78+48+57=300>>300 Junebugs
She has removed 300 Junebugs over 5 days so she has removed, on average 300/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 Junebugs per day

                    question:
                    A bus travels 60 miles per hour , for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. How much farther did the bus go than the car, in miles?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the distance traveled by the bus:**
    *  Distance = Speed x Time
    *  Distance = 60 miles/hour * 5 hours
    *  Distance = 300 miles

**2. Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**
    *  Distance = Speed x Time
    *  Distance = 30 miles/hour * 8 hours
    *  Distance = 240 miles 

**3. Find the difference in distance:**
    *  Difference =  Bus distance - Car distance 
    *  Difference = 300 miles - 240 miles
    *  Difference = 60 miles 


 **The final answer is:** 60 miles.<end_of_turn><eos>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed ; animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls : came in the tube?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Identify known quantities:** 
    * Total number of toys: 62
    * Number of blocks: 31
    * Number of stuffed animals: 8
    * Number of stacking rings: 9

2. **Determine the goal:** 
    * We need to find out the number of bouncy balls in the tube to reach the total of 62 toys.

3. **Work backward:** 
   * We know that Sophie has 62 toys total, and this includes the blocks, stuffed animals, rings, and bouncy balls. 
   * Therefore, we need to calculate the remaining toys that should be bouncy balls. 
 
4. **Calculate remaining toys:**
   *  Total toys - (blocks + stuffed animals + rings) = bouncy balls
   * This gives us 62 - (31 + 8 + 9) 
   *  62 - 48 = 14


5. **Answer:**
   * The number of bouncy balls in the tube is 14.
 {The final answer is 14}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

{The final answer is}

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Define Variables:**

*  Let Peter's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let Paul's age be represented by 'P'
*  Let John's age be represented by 'J'

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  Equation 1: P + P + J = 100 (The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old).
*  Equation 2: Paul is 10 years older than John, so P = J + 10 
 

**3. Solve for Peter's age (P):**

*  Substitute the value of 'P' from Equation 2 into Equation 1:  (J + 10) + J + J = 100
*  Combine like terms: 3J + 10 = 100
*  Subtract 10 from both sides: 3J = 90
*  Divide both sides by 3: J = 30
 
*  Substitute the value of 'J' back into Equation 2 to find 'P': P = 30 + 10 
*  Therefore, P = 40

 

**The final answer is 40** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Calculate the initial number of balloons:**

* Maria gave each friend 2 balloons.
* She had 1 balloon for herself. 
* Total balloons in the beginning: 4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons.

**2. Calculate the additional balloons:**

* Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons.
* Total balloons from Mom: 4 friends * 3 balloons/friend = 12 balloons.

**3.  Calculate the total number of balloons:**

**Problem:**

Craig and his brother take turns spelling out the longest letter words they know and counting the number of letters in those words. After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20 words with 15 letters, each. If Craig's brother has spelled out words with a total count of 50 more than Craig, calculate the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds. 

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the information**: We know: 
   - Craig spells out 20 words with 15 letters each
   - His brother spells out more than Craig, with 50 more letters.

2. **Find the number of letters for the brother's words**:
   - We need to find out the number of letters for his words. 
   -  We consider Craig's word count as inspiration as a base. 
   - We can find the number of letters for the brother's words by:
      - Adding 50 to Craig's letter count.
         - 15 letters per word * 20 words = 300 letters.
         - 300 + 50 = 350 .


3. **Determine the total letter count for Craig's and his brother** 
   - Calculate the total letters for Craig's words and his brother's words.
   - Craig: 300 letters
   - Brother: 350 letters.


4. **Calculate the total number of letters**

   - To calculate the total letter count for both brothers, we add their individual counts:
      - 300 + 350 = {650}

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the given information:** 
   *  Number of students: 29 
   *  Coupons the teacher has: 9
   *  Coupons per student: 2 bottles of juice per student
   *  Juice per coupon: 100 bottles

2. **Determine the number of juice bottles given away:**
   * The teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice.
   * Therefore, the total bottles given away is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.

3. **Calculate coupons left after dispensing juice:**
   *  Initial Coupons: 9
   *  Bottles redeemed: 58 
   *  Coupons remaining: 9 - 58 = -49

4. **Find the final answer:** 
  The teacher has a negative number of coupons left.


{The final answer is -49}

* Visit fee: $40
* Labor rate per hour: $35
* Parts cost: $60

**2. Determine the unknown:**

* Total charge: We need to calculate this.


**3. Set up the formula:**

The total charge is the sum of the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost. 

Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost

**4. Calculate the labor cost:**

* Labor cost = Labor rate x Time in hours
* Labor cost = $35/hour x 2.25 hours 
* Labor cost = $78.75

**5. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total charge = Visit fee + Labor cost + Parts cost

Solution:  
Here's how to solve the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the original cost of all the CDs.**

* Cost per CD: $15
* Number of CDs: 10
* Total cost: $15/CD * 10 CD = $150

**2. Calculate the discount amount.**

* Discount percentage: 40%
* Original cost: $150
* Discount amount: $150 * (40/100) = $60 

**3. Calculate the price of the CDs after the discount.**

* Original cost: $150
* Discount: $60
* Discounted price: $150 - $60 = $90

**4. Determine the number of CDs James keeps.**

* CDs he keeps: 10 - 5 = 5 CDs


**5. Calculate the revenue from the CDs he sells.**

* Price per CD he sells: $40
* Number of CDs sold: 5 
* Revenue: $40/CD * 5 CDs = $200

**6. Calculate the net cost.**

* Total Cost: $150
* Revenue from Sold CDs: $200
* Net Cost:   $200 - $150 = $50


**7. Total money James was out.**

He , then ; finishes the remaining distance ! while going half : the . speed. ,  How long , did it : take him to ; get : across ! the lake?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the distance James swims:**

* James swims 60% of the lake's length.
* This means he covers 0.60 * 20 miles = 12 miles. 

**2. Determine the time James spends swimming:**

* He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
* Time = Distance / Pace 
* Time = 12 miles / 2 miles/hour = 6 hours. 

**3. Calculate rest time:**

* He rests for half as long as he swims.
* Rest Time = 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

**4. Calculate the time James spends on rest:**

* Time for rest = 3 hours. 


**5. Calculate the distance remaining:**

* Remaining distance =  20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles. 

**6. Determine the speed for the remaining distance:**

* He goes half the speed and has to travel 8 miles.
* Speed = 2 miles/hour / 2 = 1 mile/hour 

**7. Calculate the time James spends on the remaining distance:** 
   * Time = Distance / Speed
   * Time = 8 miles / 1 mile/hour = 8 hours.


**8. Calculate the total time:**

* Total time = Swimming Time + Rest Time + Remaining Distance time
* Total time = 6 hours + 3 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours.



{The final answer is 17 hours} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

{The final answer is}


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Marcus's age:**

* Deanna is 26 years old.
* Marcus is half of Leo's age and five years younger. 
* Let Leo's age be represented by ""L"".
* Therefore, Marcus's age is L/2 - 5.

**2. Set up an equation:**

* We know that Marcus's age is half of Leo's age as well as five years younger. This means: L/2 - 5 = Marcus's age
*

**3. Solve for Leo's age (L):** 

* We know Marcus's age is equal to 26.
* Therefore: L/2 - 5 = 26
* Add 5 to both sides: L/2 = 31
* Multiply both sides by 2: L = 62
{The final answer is} 62

Here's how we can break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understanding the Ratio**

* The problem states Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. This means the ratio is 2/3.  

**2.  Finding the Number of Measuring Spoons**

*  We need to find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has.
*  Use the given information to find the number of cups. 
*  To find the number of measuring spoons, use the information of the ratio, for example, if he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups.

                    question:
                    A hospital has a capacity of 1000 ; beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of occupied beds:**

*   (1/5) * 1000 beds = 200 occupied beds.

**2. Calculate the total number of beds used in a week:** 
*  50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients per week.
*  They use 350 patients/week 

**3. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after a week:**

*  1000 beds - 200 occupied beds = 800 unoccupied beds. 

**4. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:**
*  800 unoccupied beds (week 1) - 800 unoccupied beds (week 2)
*


**5. Final answer** 

The final answer is 800 {unoccupied beds}. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of non-work emails**

* Start with the total emails: 16 emails
* Subtract the work emails: 16 - 7 = 9 emails

**Step 2: Calculate the number of family emails**

* Multiply the non-work emails by two-thirds: 9 * (2/3) = 6 emails

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails to family and boyfriend**

* This is the total number of family and boyfriend emails: 6 + emails 


**Step 4: Calculate the number of emails to the boyfriend**

*  One-third of the remaining emails are for her boyfriend: (1/3) * (9 - 6)  = 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 emails

 This answer is a bit of a trick, since a third is not a whole number .

**Therefore, Robyn sends 4.5 emails to her boyfriend. 


Let me know if you have any other questions or need additional clarification! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Figure out Shawna's current age:**

*   Aliya is 3 years old.
*   Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. 
*   Therefore, Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.

**2. Determine Shawna's father's current age:**

*   Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
*   Shawna's father's age = 5 * 9 = 45 years. 




**The Final Answer is:** Shawna's father is 45 years old.<end_of_turn><eos>","Shawna is three times older than Aliya so Shawn is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 years old.

*

**Here's how to break down the problem:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:** 
   - Courtney reported 48 people at the concert.
   - Kelly thinks Courtney is wrong (overstated the number).
   - Kelly believes Courtney made a 20% mistake.
   - We need to find the actual number of people who attended the concert.

2. **Setting up the Relationship:** 
   - We need to determine the actual number of people that attended the concert.
   - Kelly believes Courtney's number is 20% too high.
   - We need to calculate the actual attendance.

3. **Calculating the Overstated Number:**
   - Calculate the amount by which Courtney overstated the number of people. Use the following formula:
      - Overstated Number = Original Number * Percentage Error 
   - Overstated Number = 48 * 0.20 
   - Overstated Number = 9.6

4. **Finding the Actual Number:** 
   - Subtract the overstated number from the original reported number to isolate the real number.
   - Actual Number = Original Number - Overstated Number


5. **Calculating the Actual Number:** 
   - Actual Number = 48 - 9.6
   - Actual Number = 38.4


**The final answer is:** 38.4 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

Here's how we can break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total holes dug after the first three days:**

* Total holes = 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes

**2. Account for the filled-in holes:**

*  Holes filled = 2
* Total holes left after filling = 31 - 2 = 29 holes

**3. Determine the number of holes on the island after four days:**

* Four times the number of holes on the first day.
* Holes after four days = 10 * 4 = 40 holes
 

**4. Find the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**

* The number of holes dug on the fourth day =  40 - 29 = 11 holes




{The final answer is 11} . 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

**2. Set Up the Equation:**

* Lainey and Amora received 70 chips each.
* The other two people get x chips.
* The third person gets 15 more than the number of other people, so x + 15.

* The total number of corn chips:  70 + 70 + (x + 15)

* **Equation:** 70 + 70 + (x + 15) = Total corn chips

**3. Solve the Equation for 'x'**

* Combine like terms: 140 + x + 15 = Total corn chips
* Combine like terms: 155 + x = Total corn chips

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the cost of the tickets. 

**2. Set up an equation:**

* The total cost of the trip is the sum of the supplies and the tickets.
*  Equation:  x + $400 = total cost 
*  We know the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, so:  x = 1.50x 
 
**3. Solve for x:**

*  We know x + $400 = total cost
*  We need to isolate x 
*  Subtract $400 from both sides of the equation:   x = $400* 
*  So,  x = 1.50x


**4.  State the answer:**

*The final answer is $400.



<end_of_turn><eos>","He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let  'x' = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
 
**2. Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

* Alex's catch:  'x + 5'  
* Stan's catch: 4x - 13 
* Total catch: x + (x + 5) + (4x - 13) = 339

**3. Solve for 'x':**

* Combine like terms in the total catch equation: 6x - 8 = 339
* Add 8 to both sides of the equation: 6x = 347
* Divide both sides by 6: x = 57.83

**4. Find Stan's Catch:**

* Substitute the value of 'x' into the equation for Stan's catches: Stan's catches = 4(57.83) - 13 
* Calculate: 231.32 - 13 = 218.32

 


**5. Answer the Question:**

* Stan caught approximately **218.32** Pokemon.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   *  Let 'E' represent the total number of episodes. 
   * Let 'M' represent the total duration of the show in minutes.

2. **Relate Episodes and Duration:** 
   *  We know there are 'E' episodes.
   *  Each episode lasts 20 minutes. 
   *  Therefore, M = 20E.


3. **Find the Number of Episodes:**
    *  We know there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode.
   * Therefore, E = M/20

4. **Solve for Total Duration:**
   * Substitute the value of E from step 3 into the equation for M in step 2. 
   * We have: M = 20 * (M/20),  
   * Simplify
    * Multiply both sides by 20
    
5. **Find the answer:** 

 {The final answer is:  M = 20M}
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.

*
Let's break down the problem.


**Step 1: Define variables**

*  Let  *x* represent the time in minutes it takes Andy for synthetic gut strings.
*  Let  *y* represent the time in minutes it takes Andy for polyester strings. 
*  Let  *z* represent the time in minutes it takes Andy for hybrid sets. 

**Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information.**
*  **Synthetic gut:** 3 racquets * *x* minutes/racket
*  **Polyester:** 5 racquets * *y* minutes/racket 
*  **Hybrid:** 4 racquets * *z* minutes/racket



**Step 3: Calculate total time**

*  Add up the time for each type of stringing: 
 * Total time =  3*x + 5*y + 4*z


**Step 4:  Find the average time**

*  Divide the total time by the number of racquets: 
     *  Average time = (3*x + 5*y + 4*z) / 12 


**Step 5:  Solve for each variable**
*    Use the information about Andy’s time for synthetic gut, polyester, and hybrid stringing to get an equation for *x*, *y*, and *z*. 
 



Let me know if you need elaboration or have more tennis pro shop questions! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.
He is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.
He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.

                    John decides to ? buy new phones for him, his 2 kids, and his wife.  Each phone after the first 2 is half price.  If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out the cost of the first two phones:**

* We know the price of each phone is $600.
* This means the first 2 phones cost $600 * 2 = $1200. 

**2. Determine the cost of the remaining phones:**

* Each phone after the first two is half price, which means they cost $600 / 2 = $300.
*  So, the remaining 3 phones cost $300 * 3 = $900.

 **3. Calculate the total cost:**

* The total cost is the cost of the first two phones plus the cost of the remaining phones.
* The total cost is $1200 + $900 = $2100.


**The final answer is $2100.** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones
2 of the phones cost 600 so their cost is 2*600=$<<2*600=1200>>1200
The other two phones cost 600/2=$<<600/2=300>>300
So they cost 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600
So the total cost is 1200+600=$<<1200+600=1800>>1800

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define the variables:**

* Let  'x' represent the number of players on Carlton's team.
* Since Zeke's team has 0.7x more players, we can represent this as: x + 0.7x

**2. Set up the equation:**

* We know Carlton's team has 13 players:  x = 13
* Substitute this value into the equation from step 1: x + 0.7x = 13 + 0.7x 

**3. Solve for the combined number of players:**

* Since we want the total number of players in both teams, we can add the number of players for both teams: x + 0.7x

**4. Final answer:**


{The final answer is 13 + 0.7x } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","If Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 7 players + 13 players = 20 players.

Here's how we can solve the problem:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* Robert is building a rectangular fence around his garden.
* The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. 
* He needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing.

**2. Calculate the Perimeter:**

* The perimeter of the fence is the total length of all the sides.
* Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (15+10) feet 
* Perimeter = 2 * 25 feet = 50 feet

**3. Calculate the Number of Slats Needed:**

*  He needs 2 slats for each foot of fencing he builds.
* Number of slats = Perimeter / slats per foot 
* Number of slats = 50 feet / 2 slats/foot
* Number of slats = 25 slats


**4. The Final Answer**

{The final answer is 25 wooden slats.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long

Then ! she kept . 1/4 , of , the ! oranges and sold the ? rest. How many ! oranges ; did Mrs. ! Harrington ? sell if each box contains 20 oranges?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Understanding the Problem**

* **Start with the Basics:** Mrs. Harrington began with many oranges. We need to calculate how much she has left.
* **Divide and Conquer:**  We will work backwards, finding out who got oranges, how many boxes and then how many oranges were kept and sold.  

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Calculate oranges given to family:** 
   * 2 boxes / box = 4 boxes
   * 4 boxes * 2 oranges / box = 8 oranges received


2. **Calculate orange kept:** 
   * 1/4 * 12 boxes * 20 oranges / box = 6 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 120 oranges

3. **Calculate oranges remaining after giving to family:**
   * 12 boxes - 4 boxes = 8 boxes


4. **Determine total oranges now:** 
   * 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges


5. **Calculate oranges sold:**
   * 8 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 160 oranges
    * 160 oranges * (1/4) = 40 oranges 

 
**Final Answer:** {Mrs. Harrington sold 40 oranges. }   
<end_of_turn><eos>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.
She kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.
So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.

Here's how we solve this:

**Step 1: Determine the number of states in the USA.**

* The USA has 50 states.

**Step 2: Calculate half the number of states in the USA.**

* Half the number of states in the USA is 50 / 2 = 25 states.

**Step 3: Find the number of states in India.**

* India has 4 states more than half the number in the USA.
* This means India has 25 + 4 = 29 states. 

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of states in both countries.**

* Total states in India and USA = 29 (India) + 50 (USA) = 79 states.


 {The final answer is 79} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find out how many cherries Jerry has.** 
   -  Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 10 fewer than Robert, so Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

**2. Find the total cherries Richard has.**
   - Richard has 20 cherries.

**3. Find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.**
  *  Robert has 30 cherries, and Richard has 20 cherries. 
  *  The difference between 30 and 20 is 10.

 **The final answer is 10** 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* We know the blue car costs $100.
* We need to find the price of the red car and the total cost of both cars.
* The problem uses percentages, which means we will need to convert the percentage into a decimal.

**2. Determine the Discount**

* The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. 
* We need to find out how much cheaper the red car is.
* To do this, we can calculate the percentage of the discount from the blue car price.
* 40% = 0.40 (convert to decimal)

**3. Calculate the Price of the Red Car**

* The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so its price will be less by 40% of $100.
* Price of the red car = $100 - ($100 * 0.40) = $100 - $40 = $60.
 

**4. Find the Total Cost**

* Total cost of both cars = price of the blue car + price of the red car
* Total cost = $100 +  $60 = $160 


**Final answer: The total cost of both cars is $160.



<end_of_turn><eos>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.
That means, that the red car costs 100 - 40 = $<<100-40=60>>60.
So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

*The problem is poorly worded, so I have tried to understand the question and make sure the answer fully reflects all the factors involved.*


**Step 1: Gather the information about the beads from each family member.**

* Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
* Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more than Adrianne's mother, so her sister gave her 20 + 10 = 30 beads. 
* Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as Adrianne's mother, so her friend gave her 20 * 2 = 40 beads. 
 


**Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads from all the gifts.**

* Total beads from mother: 20 beads.
* Total beads from sister: 30 beads.
* Total beads from friend: 40 beads.
* Total beads: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Friday's Catch:** Joe caught 4 times the amount on Friday as on Thursday, so he caught 3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds on Friday.
 
2. **Saturday's Catch:**  He caught half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday, meaning he caught 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds on Saturday.

3. **Total Catch:**  Over the three days, Joe caught a total of 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds of crawfish.

4. **Servings:**  Since each serving is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 pounds / 3 pounds/serving = 7 servings.


{The final answer is 7} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1.  Define the Initial Information:**

* We have a class of 30 students.
* 20% of the students are football players.  
    - This means 0.20 * 30 = 6 football players 

**2.  Calculate the Remaining Students:**

* Students who are NOT football players = 30 - 6 = 24 students.

**3.  Determine the Number of Cheerleaders/Band Members:**

* 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band. 
* 0.25 * 24 = 6  cheerleaders or band members.

**4.  Identify the Number of Students Leaving Early:**

* Students leaving early = 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students {The final answer is}

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Understand the Given Information**

* Charlie's boots are 5 times the size of Sophie's boots.
* Sophie wears size 1 boot.

**2.  Find Charlie's boot size**

*  5 times the size of Sophie's boots means Charlie's boots are (5 * 1) = 5 times the size of Sophie's
 
**3. Express the Size in Simpler Terms** 

* We need to express the size of Charlie's boots in a standard way.
* Charlie's boots are 5 times the size of Sophie's boots, so we know Charlie's boots are 5 times the size of Sophie's.
* Since Sophie wears size 1 boots, we know Charlie wears 5 * 1 = 5 size boots 

**4. Calculate the average size**

*  To find the average size, we sum the sizes of both people's shoes and divide by 2.
*  The average size is (5 + 1) / 2 = 3

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the petunias:**

* Cost per petunia = $3.00
* Number of petunias per basket = 3
* Total cost of petunias per basket = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

**2. Calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:**

* Cost per vine = $2.50
* Number of vines per basket = 2
* Total cost of vines per basket = $2.50 * 2 = $5.00

**3. Calculate the total cost for all the baskets:**

* Total cost of petunias for all baskets = $9.00 * 5 = $45.00
* Total cost of vines for all baskets = $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Determine the peeling time.**

*  Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute. 
* We want to peel 90 shrimp.

To find the time to peel 90 shrimp, we need to divide the total number of shrimp by the number Emily peels per minute:

 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes

**Step 2: Determine the cooking time.**

* Emily cooks 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. 
* We want to cook 90 shrimp.
* We already got the time to peel shrimp.

To find the cooking time, we need to divide the number of shrimp by the number Emily cooks per minute:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/minute = 3 minutes

**Step 3: Find the total cooking and peeling time**

* Combining the peeling and cooking time.
* 15 minutes (peeling) + 3 minutes (cooking) = 18 minutes

 **Final Answer:** {The final answer is 18 minutes.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes
Then find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches
Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

**Solution:**
Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem, breaking down the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   *  We know the temperatures of the room when the AC runs on low and high settings.
   *  The rate of temperature change with the AC off.
   *  The duration for which the AC operates on low and high settings.
   *  We need to find the final temperature, and how much lower than the original starting temperature it is. 

2. **Finding the Net Temperature Change:** 
   * **Without AC:** The room temperature will rise 2 degrees per hour on its own. 
   * **On Low:** The rate at which the AC cools on low is 2 degrees per hour.
   * **On High:** The rate at which the AC cools on high is 3 degrees per hour.


3. **Calculating Temperature Changes in the AC Cycle:**
   * **Low Setting (3 hours):** The AC will cool the room 6 degrees (2°C/hour * 3 hours).
   * **High Setting (4 hours):** The AC cools by 12 degrees (°C/hour * 4 hours).
   
4. **Understanding Final Temperature:**

   * **Final temperature:**  It is the temperature the room will reach after all the AC cycles.


**Final Answer:** {The final answer is } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Here's how we can solve the problem: 

**1.  Set up variables:**

* Let 'x' represent Bill's current age.
* Let 'y' represent his father's age when he saw the comet.

**2. Work out the father's age when Bill saw it for the first time:** 

* Bill saw the comet when he was three times his father's age when he saw it. 
   *  Bill's age when he saw it for the first time was y 
    
**3. Use the given information to formulate a linear equation:**

* We know  Bill's father saw the comet when he was y years old. 


**4. Formulate the equation and solve:**

* **We know:**
     * Bill saw the comet when he was 30 years old, so we have the equation:  x - 30 = 3*(y - 30) 
* **Solve for x**

    * Electric bill: Once per month
    * Gas bill: Every month 
    * Church: Twice per month
    * Pest service: Quarterly (This means 4 times per year)

2. **Calculate total checks for individual payments:**

    * Gas Bills: 12 checks/year (monthly)
    * Church Checks: 12 checks/year (twice a month)
    * Pest Service Checks: 4 checks/year (quarterly)

3. **Add the checks for all payments:**
    * Total checks = 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 12 (church) + 4 (pest service) {Total checks = 38}


**Final answer: 38 checks**

 

 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.

     - G = (3/4) * Total Flights
   - Equation 2 (Remaining Flights):  The remaining flights are split equally. So: 
     - F + D = (1/2) * G   

4. **Solve for Number of Flights:**
   - We will simplify the equations from step 3 by plugging in the value for ""G"" in Equation 2 using equation 1.

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Based upon each equation, we can determine the actual number of flights to France.


Final Answer: {{ The final answer is }}
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

What is the combined ; length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Define the durations:**

*   **Tobias:** 20 seconds per howl.
*   **Chikote:** Twice the duration of Tobias, so 20 seconds * 2 = 40 seconds per howl.
*   **Igneous:**  The same length as Tobias and Chikote combined, so 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds per howl.

**2. Calculate the total time for each wolf's howl:**

*   **Tobias:** 20 seconds/howl *  (Number of howls)
*   **Chikote:** 40 seconds/howl * (Number of howls)
*   **Igneous:** 60 seconds/howl * (Number of howls)

**3. Find the combined time for all wolves:**

*   Add the total time for each wolf's howl together. This will be the combined time.

 

**4.  Convert the time to minutes**
 
 * Divide the combined howl time by 60 to find the time in minutes.



Let me know if you'd like me to illustrate the calculations for each wolf's duration and the combined time, in detail! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Helene is ; twice as ; old as the average age of the : group, and the total . age of the children is 20. If ? Akbar is 3 years old ; and Alessandro is 4 years old, ? calculate the age of Wilfred.<end_of_turn>


**Here's a breakdown of the solution:**

1. **Define the variables:**
   * Let 'x' represent the average age of the group. 
   * Let 'h' represent the age of Helene. 
   * Let 'w' represent the age of Wilfred. 

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   * We know Helene is two times the average age. This translates to: h = 2x
   * We know the total age of the group is 20. This can be expressed as: 3 + 4 + x + h = 20 
   * Simplifying the last equation: 7 + x + h = 20 

3. **Substitute the expression for h:** 
   * Substitute '2x' for 'h' in the equation to make it: 7 + x + 2x = 20

4. **Solve for x:**
   * Combine the 'x' terms: 7 + 3x = 20
   * Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 13
   * Divide both sides by 3: x = 4.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

5. **Find the age of Helene:**
   * Substitute the value of 'x' into the equation h = 2x
   * Therefore, h = 2 * 4.33 = 8.66 (rounded to two decimal places).

6. **Find the age of Wilfred:**
   * Since Helene is twice the average age. Therefore, h = 2x
   * We know h = 8.66
   * Use the equation (h = 2x), thus 8.66 = 2 (4.33).
   *  Therefore, we have 8.66 = 8.66



**The final answer is:** 8.66<end_of_turn><eos>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

*Step 1: Identify the information given.*

We are given these pieces of information:
* Walter collects $500 from neighbors
* Walter collects $1500 from an online fund 
* His lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else.
* Walter is going to tell his friend about the neighbors and the online fund 
* His friend gives Walter $200

*Step 2:  Set up variables.*

Let:
*  `X` = the amount Walter's friends donate


*Step 3:  Define relationships.*

We can use the given information to help us define relationships between the variables.

*  Walter's total money from friends:  `X`
  
*  The lawyer's donation will be three times the amount from his friends.




*Step 4:  Write an equation.*

* Walter's friend's donation is the starting point.

* The total amount from friends: Walter's friends donation ($X) plus his friend's donation.




*Step 5:  Solve for the lawyer's contribution.*

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**  
   * 100 guests * 15 cookies/guest = 1500 cookies

2. **Calculate the number of cookies donated to the church:** 
   * 1500 cookies * (1/2) = 750 cookies

3. **Calculate the number of people in the church next door:** 
   * 750 cookies / 15 cookies/person = 50 people

   


{The final answer is 50} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.

**Here's a step-by-step breakdown to solve the problem:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.
   -  There are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family.
   - The problem describes the watermelon's slice size being twice the size of a kid's
2. **Setting up Variables:**
   - Let 'x' represent the size of a kid's slice. 
   -  The adult slice size is twice the kid's so it would be 2 * x. 
3. **Using Proportionality:**  
   -  We want to determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.  
4. **Formulating an Equation:** 
   - **Define Proportion:** The ratio of adult slices to kid slices should be 2:1, we need to create an equation that represents this.
   - **Express Proportion with Variables:** Let’s represent the proportion of watermelon a kid gets, with the adult slice is twice the kid's.
5. **Finding the Solution:**
   - **Solve for x:** We know that the kid's slice is represented by the variable x.
6. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   - **Calculate the slices adults:** We calculate the total slices for the adults and divide that figure by the total watermelon size and calculate the percentage. 

 

Let me know if you would like additional clarity on any of these steps. 
{The final answer is} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Inpatient Rounds:**

* **Time per round:** 20 minutes
* **Number of inpatients:** 9
* **Total time for rounds:** 20 minutes/round * 9 inpatients = 180 minutes 
* **Convert minutes to hours:** 180 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 3 hours

**2. Appointments:**

* **Number of appointments:** 10
* **Time per appointment:** 30 minutes

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total time needed:**

* Batter preparation: 20 minutes
* Baking: 30 minutes
* Cooling: 2 hours = 120 minutes 
* Frosting: 10 minutes
* **Total time needed: 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes**

**2. Determine the earliest start time:**

* Jordan needs to finish the cake by 5:00 pm.
* She has 180 minutes needed to complete the cake. 
* Let's use a simple timer and allow for flexibility.

**3. Work backward: **

To figure out the earliest start time, we need to figure out how far into the day Jordan can begin. 


{The final answer is 1:00 PM} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

*


##  Solution
Here's a step-by-step approach to the problem:

**1. Calculate the Volume of the Pool**

*  **Volume = width × length × depth**
*  Volume = 14 feet × 25 feet × 4 feet
*  Volume = 1400 cubic feet

**2. Convert Cubic Feet to Gallons**

* **1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons** 
* Volume in gallons = 1400 cubic feet × 7.48 gallons/cubic foot
* Volume in gallons = 10,392 gallons

**3. Calculate the Total Cost**

*  **Cost = Volume × Price per gallon**
*  Cost = 10,392 gallons × $0.10/gallon
*  Cost = $1,039.20

 


{The final answer is $1,039.20}<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet
He followed the pool company instructions and found his pool required 1,400 x 5.9 = <<1400*5.9=8260>>8,260 gallons of water.
The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 x 8,260 gallons = $<<0.10*8260=826>>826.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let 'R' represent the number of red sticks.
   - Let 'B' represent the number of blue sticks.
   - Let 'Y' represent the number of yellow sticks.

2. **Set up Equations from the given Information:**
   - We know there are 9 red sticks, so:  R = 9 
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, so: B = R + 5
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so: Y = B - 3

3. **Solve for the Total Number of Sticks:** 
   -  We can find the total number of sticks by adding the values of the different types of sticks.
   
   - Total Sticks = R + B + Y
   - Total Sticks = R + (R + 5) + (B - 3) 

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - Total Sticks = R + R + 5 + B - 3
   - Total Sticks = 2R + B + 2

5. **Evaluate the Variables:**
   -  * Substitute R = 9 and B = R + 5 to get: Total Sticks = 2(9) + (R + 5) + 2


6. **Final Answer:**
    * Total Sticks = 18 + (9 + 5) + 2
    * Total Sticks = 18 + 14 + 2
    * Total Sticks = 34
   {The final answer is 34}




<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 9 + 5 = <<9+5=14>>14 blue sticks.
There are 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11 yellow sticks.
There are a total of 9 + 14 + 11 = <<9+14+11=34>>34 sticks.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Matteo's distance:**

*  Distance = Speed × Time
*  Distance (Matteo) = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours
*  Distance (Matteo) = 220 miles

**2. Calculate Shandy's distance:**

*  Distance (Shandy) = Speed × Time
*  Distance (Shandy) = 45 miles/hour × 10 hours
*  Distance (Shandy) = 450 miles

**3. Find the difference in distance:**

*  Difference = Distance (Shandy) - Distance (Matteo) 
*  Difference = 450 miles - 220 miles
*  Difference = 230 miles


{The final answer is 230 miles.}

* Bethany runs 10 laps in 1 hour.
* Trey runs 4 more laps than Bethany, so he runs 10 + 4 = 14 laps in 1 hour.

**2. Find out how many laps Shaelyn runs.**

* Trey runs 14 laps in 1 hour.
* Shaelyn runs half as many laps as Trey, so she runs 14/2 = 7 laps in 1 hour.

**3. Find out how many laps Quinn runs.**

* Shaelyn runs 7 laps in 1 hour.
* Quinn runs 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so he runs 7 - 2 = 5 laps in 1 hour.

*Be sure! to show all the intermediate calculations.

Solution:
1. **Calculate the water pumped on the first day:**
    * Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity in the first day.
    * This is equal to (1/4) * 18000 gallons = 4500 gallons. 

2. **Calculate the water pumped by Ms. B on the first day:**
    * Ms. B pumped 3/4 of the water Wanda pumped on the first day.
    * This is equal to (3/4) * 4500 gallons = 3375 gallons.

3. **Calculate the water pumped on the second day:**
    * Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day. 
    * This is equal to (2/3) * 4500 gallons = 3000 gallons.

4. **Calculate the water pumped by Ms. B on the second day:** 
    * Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
    * This is equal to (1/3) * 3375 gallons = 1125 gallons. 

5. **Calculate the total amount of water pumped on both days:** 
    * Total water pumped: 4500 gallons + 3375 gallons + 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = 12000 gallons.

6. **Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank** 
    * Water remaining: 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

{The final answer is 6000 gallons}
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

Capacity loss decreases over time
 
**Step 1: Outline the problem**

* We know the initial charge of the power bank. 
* We know how the battery capacity lost per hour in the beginning.
* We know how capacity loss changes at a different rate after 5 hours.
* We know the final charge percentage of the power bank. 
* We need to find the initial charge of the power bank.


**Step 2: Set up equations**

To work through this problem, we can define how much the power bank capacity decreases per hour. We will call this “Loss”. 
   * In the first part of the problem, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, so:  Loss = 0.09 * Initial Charge

**Step 3: Define variables**

* Let “C” represent the initial charge of the power bank.
* Let “t” represent the number of hours.

**Step 4: Account for time**

* Time 1: Maria is charging the power bank to full capacity. This is the starting point. 
* Time 2: The battery starts to lose charge at a different rate (7% capacity loss per hour). 

**Step 5: Formulate a solution**


* We need to account for how the power bank capacity loss changes after it gets to a reduced capacity. 
* We need to work backward through the calculation, starting from the final state of the power bank.


{The final answer is 82.2% . } 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

Here's how we can break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate her total weekly earnings:**

* Hourly wages: $10/hour 
* Weekly earnings (wages): $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400/week

* Hourly tips: $15/hour
* Weekly tips: $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week

* Total weekly earnings: $400/week + $600/week = $1000/week

**2. Determine her weekly savings:**

* Savings goal: 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000

* Weekly savings: $1000/week 


**3. Calculate how many weeks it will take to reach the savings goal:**

* Weeks to save: $2,000 / $1,000/week = 2 weeks



**Answer:** {The final answer is 2 weeks }

* Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.50/peach = $1.50
* Pears: 4 pears * $0.50/pear = $2.00
* Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1.00/kiwi = $2.00
* Apples: 5 apples * $0.75/apple = $3.75

**2. Find the remaining money:**

* Total spent : $1.50 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $3.75 = $9.25

**3. Determine how much money remains after purchasing the other fruits:**

* Jamaar has $10.00
* Spent on other fruits is $9.25
* Money remaining: $10.00 - $9.25 = $0.75

Here's a breakdown of the solution, with each step explained:

**1. Calculate the total number of sweets:**

* Anne has 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces. 
* Total sweets = 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces

**2. Determine the number of sweets remaining after Anne keeps some:**

*  Anne kept two packs, so she has 15 - 2 = 13 packs remaining.
 
**3. Calculate the number of sweets distributed to friends:**

* Anne distributed the remaining sweets to her 10 friends equally.
* Number of sweets per friend = 900 pieces / 10 friends = 90 pieces/friend. 

**4. State the final answer:**

{The final answer is 90 pieces of sweets each of her friends received.}

Here's how we can break down this problem:

**1. Understand the given information:**

* James reads 3 pages per 10 minutes.
* He reads 18 pages.
* We need to determine how long his reading session lasts.

**2. Calculate the number of reading sessions:** 

*  We can calculate the number of 10-minute reading sessions needed to cover the 18 pages.
* 18 pages / 3 pages/10 minutes =  6 reading sessions.


**3. Determine total reading duration:**

* James reads for 6 sessions.
*  We need to figure out the total reading time in minutes. 
*   Total reading duration = 6 reading sessions * 10 minutes/session = 60 minutes


**4. The answer**

* James spends 60 minutes reading. 
 {The final answer is 60 minutes}

2. **Early Checkouts:** 24 guests opted for early checkout.
3. **Late Checkouts:** 15 guests opted for a late checkout
4. **Afternoon Check-Ins:** Twice the number of those who chose late checkouts, so 2 * 15 = 30 check-ins.
5. **Dinner Check-Ins:** 7 more people checked in after dinner was served
6. **Total Check-Ins:** 30 + 7 = 37 guests check in after dinner.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Easy questions:**

*   40% of the 60-item quiz are easy. 
*   This is represented as 0.40 * 60 = 24 questions.

**2. Difficult questions:**

*   The remaining questions are  difficult, divided equally as the average and difficult. 
*   Questions are equally divided for the average and difficult so this is 30 - 24 = 6 questions.

**3. Aries's success rate on easy questions:**

*   Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions.

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the earnings from cookies:**
   *  She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she earned 80 * $1 = $80. 
2. ** Calculate the earnings from cupcakes:**
   * She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she earned 60 * $4 = $240.
3. **Calculate the total earnings:** 
   *  Suzanne's total earnings were $80 + $240 = $320.
4. ** Calculate the cost of giving money to her sisters:**  
   *  Suzanne gave $10 each to two sisters, so she spent 2 * $10 = $20.

{The final answer: }


Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution.

**Step 1: Identify known information**

* The Smith twins found 30 eggs each.
* Total eggs found by the twins = 30 eggs/twin * 2 twins = 60 eggs.

**Step 2:  Determine the unknown**

* Total eggs found by friends = Total eggs found – eggs found by twins. 

**Step 3: Calculate the unknown using arithmetic**

* Total eggs found = 100 eggs
* Total eggs found by the twins = 60 eggs
* Total eggs found by friends = 100 eggs - 60 eggs = 40 eggs 

{The final answer: 40}

**Solution**

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let `x` represent the ore mined per day with an iron pickaxe. 
   - The dwarf's ore production with a steel pickaxe is `1.2x`. 
   - The dwarves' total production per day is `1.2x + 0.5x`, representing both types of pickaxes.

2. **Define the total production of the group in a day:**
   -  We are given they mine 12 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe.

3. **Define the total production of the group over a month:** 
   -  We know there are 40 dwarves.
   - The total ore produced by the dwarves is `12*40 = 480` pounds by the dwarves. 
   - We need to calculate the ore production per day. 
   
4. **Calculate daily ore production with different pickaxes:**
   -  ""With a steel pickaxe, than with an iron pickaxe"" meaning that the steel pickaxe produces 1.2x * 1.5 = 1.8x more ore than an iron pickaxe
   -  ""How many pounds of ore can 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes mine in a month""

  {The final answer is 7200 pounds } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day
Then multiply that amount by 150% to find how much a dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe: 24 pounds/day * 150% = <<24*150*.01=36>>36 pounds/day
Then multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day

Knowing that the prices are proportional, how much will the package with 8 sandwiches cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to break down the problem:

**1.  Define Proportions**

* We are given that the prices of the packages are proportional. This means that the ratio of the price to the number of sandwiches is the same for all three packages. 

**2.  Set up a Ratio**

* Let's use variables to represent the price of a package and the number of sandwiches.
*  We can set up a ratio of the price of the first package to the price of the second package:  $3 / $6
*  We can simplify this ratio.

**3.  Solve for the Price of the Package with 8 Sandwiches**

* We know that the prices are proportional and we can set up a ratio using the prices and amount of sandwiches provided. 


{The final answer is $24}

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1. Calculate the number of red balloons burst:**

* 40% of 25 red balloons = (40/100) * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.

**2.  Number of red balloons remaining:**

*  Number of red balloons left = 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

**3. Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:**

* Half of 12 yellow balloons = (1/2) * 12 = 6 yellow balloons.

**4. Number of yellow balloons remaining:**

*  Number of yellow balloons left = 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons.

**5. Total balloons after releasing some:**

*  Total balloons left = 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) = 21 balloons.
 
**6.  Calculate the number of blue balloons added:**

* 75% of 8 blue balloons = (75/100) * 8 = 6 blue balloons added

**7.  Number of balloons at school:**
 
* Total balloons carried = 21 (remaining) + 6 (blue) = 27 balloons

 {The final answer is 27} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.

                    question:
                    Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute , teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal ? extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**1. Define the Possible Outcomes:**

* **Scenario 1:** Normal teacher, no extension. 
* **Scenario 2:** Normal teacher, extension given.
* **Scenario 3:** Substitute teacher, no extension.
* **Scenario 4:** Substitute teacher, extension given.


**2. Break Down Probabilities for Each Scenario:**

* **Scenario 1 (Normal teacher, No Extension):**
    * Probability of normal teacher: 1 - 0.50 = 0.50
    * Probability of no extension: 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
* **Scenario 2 (Normal teacher, Extension):**
    * Probability of normal teacher: 1 - 0.50 = 0.50
    * Probability of extension: 0.40
* **Scenario 3 (Substitute teacher, No Extension):** 
    * Probability of substitute teacher: 0.50
    * Probability of no extension: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
  
* **Scenario 4 (Substitute teacher, Extension):** 
    * Probability of substitute teacher: 0.50
    * Probability of extension: 0.20

**3. Analyze the Combined Probability:**

*  To find the probability of Marcus having to complete his homework, consider the probability of each scenario multiplied by the likelihood of that scenario happening.


**4. Calculate the Final Probability:**

* To get the final probability, multiply the different probabilities of each scenario together 
  


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

*Note:  No punctuation was used, in the original question.


Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Find the total number of tickets available.** 
   - We know the Fine Arts Center has space for 6000 people.
   - We subtract the seats for graduates and faculty: 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750

2. **Divide the available tickets by the number of graduates**.
   - We find the number of tickets available for each graduate: 4750 / 1000 = 4.75

{The final answer is} 4.75



<end_of_turn><eos>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates
Minus seats for faculty and graduates from total seats allowed. 6000 - 1250 = <<6000-1250=4750>>4750 remaining seats.
Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

He ! can ? eat twice , as . many ? medium-sized beans as large beans. .  And eating 3 small beans is the same as , eating ? 1 medium-sized bean.  : How ! many , small ; beans : can ? Grandpa eat?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
    *  Let 'L' represent the number of large jelly beans Grandpa can eat. 
    * Let 'M' represent the number of medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
    * Let 'S' represent the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
    *  Equation 1: L = 75  (Grandpa can eat 75 large beans.)
    *  Equation 2: M = 2L (He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.) 
    *  Equation 3: S = 3L (Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium bean.)

3. **Solve for small beans (S):**
    *  We can solve for 'M' using Equation 2: M = 2 * 75 = 150
    *  Then, we can use Equation 3 to express S, the number of small beans, in terms of L.
    *  We can substitute the value of 'L' in Equation 3: S = 3 * 75 = 225, which represents the number of small beans.



**{The final answer is 225}** 
 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate total time spent:**

* Melissa spends 6 hours/day * 3 days = 18 hours in total.

**2. Calculate total pay before expenses:**

* Melissa's total pay for 3 days is 18 hours * $15/hour = $270.

**3. Calculate total parking expenses:**

* Melissa spends $3/day * 3 days = $9 for parking.

 **4. Calculate final pay after expenses:**

* Melissa's final pay is $270 - $9 = $261.


**5. Calculate pay per hour after expenses** 
* Melissa earns $261 / 18 hours = $14.67/hour 



**The final answer is $14.67/hour.** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day

Here's the breakdown of how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Understanding the Setup**

*   Richard wants to create soda fountains along his driveway.
*   He'll have soda bottles placed 3 feet apart.
*   Each step involves placing and dropping a candy into a soda bottle (taking 5 seconds)

**2. Calculating the Number of Bottled Fountains**

*   Width of the driveway = 24 feet
*   Spacing between soda bottles = 3 feet
*   Number of soda fountains =  Driveway width / Spacing between bottles 
*   Number of soda fountains = 24 feet / 3 feet = 8 bottles

**3. Determining the Time per Bottle**

*   Richard's setup process takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next.

**4. Calculating Total Set-up Time**
*   Total time for all the soda fountains = Time per bottle * Number of bottle
*   Total time = 5 seconds/bottle * 8 bottles = 40 seconds 



**{The final answer is 40 seconds}** 
<end_of_turn><eos>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.
If Richard starts at 0 seconds with the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go onto the next bottle to drop the candy, then it will take him 5 seconds x 7 bottles = 35 seconds total.

*This question is a little tricky. Here's a step-by-step guide*

**Step 1: Determine the total number of apples.**

* Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples. 
* Each box contains 40 apples.
* Total apples = 2 boxes * 40 apples/box = 80 apples

**Step 2: Calculate the number of packs he can make.**

* He wants to pack each pack with 8 apples. 
* Number of packs = Total apples / Pack size 
* Number of packs = 80 apples / 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

mozzarella cheese


**Solution:**

1. **Identify known quantities:**
    * Parmesan cheese price: $11 per pound
    * Mozzarella cheese price: $6 per pound
    * Amount of Parmesan cheese: 2 pounds
    * Amount of mozzarella cheese: 3 pounds
    * Initial cash: $50 

2. **Calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:**
    * Cost of Parmesan = Price per pound * Quantity
    * Cost of Parmesan = $11 * 2 = $22

3. **Calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:**
    * Cost of mozzarella = Price per pound * Quantity
    * Cost of mozzarella = $6 * 3 = $18

4. **Calculate the total cost of the cheese:**
   * Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella 
   * Total cost = $22 + $18 = $40

5. **Determine the remaining cash:**
   * Remaining cash = Initial cash - Total cost
   * Remaining cash = $50 - $40 = $10


{The final answer is $10} 




<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.
The cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.
The total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.
So, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.

Let's break this problem down step by step:

**1. Understand the Scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1:** Jim works his old job paying $25,000 per year.
* **Scenario 2:** Jim earns a new job after college, earning $75,000 per year (3 times his pre-college salary).

**2.  Calculate the Total Cost of Loans:**

* The total cost of loans is $50,000 per year for 4 years. 
* Total loan cost = $50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

**3. Calculate the Total Earnings in Scenario 2:**

* Jim's new yearly income: $75,000
* **Total earnings (across 4 years) =** $75,000/year * 4 years = $300,000

**4. Analyze the Profitability:**

* **Profit:** $300,000 (new earnings) - $200,000 (loan amounts) = $100,000

**5. Determine Time to Achieve Same Earnings (Profit):**


* We need to figure out how long it would take to reach a $100,000 profit.


**6. Evaluate Time Investment & Financial Considerations:** 

* It's difficult to definitively say what time it would take for Jim to earn the equivalent of his loan payments and forgone income. 
* This depends heavily on interest rates on the loans and potential future job opportunities and income growth.


**7. Important Notes:**

* This solution provides a simplified view.
* It assumes Jim didn't incur substantial expenses beyond tuition, which could influence the overall time.
* It's essential to consider long-term perspectives, like career choices and future financial goals.
 


{The final answer is  It would likely take Jim four years (or approximately the same span of time he was in college) to earn enough to pay off his loans and make up for forgoing earnings, given the potential to earn more and build additional wealth. } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years

**Solution:**
1. **Define the dimensions of the bed:**
   - The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.

2. **Calculate the dimensions of the additional fabric pieces:**
   - Add 2 feet to the length: 6 ft + 2 ft = 8 feet
   - Add 2 feet to the width: 8 ft + 2 ft = 10 feet.

3. **Determine the area of the bed:**
   - Area of the bed = length x width
   - Area of the bed = 6 ft * 8 ft = 48 square feet.

4. **Calculate the area of the additional fabric pieces:**
   - Area of additional fabric =  length x width
   - Area of additional fabric = 8 ft * 10 ft = 80 square feet.

5. **Find the total area required**
   - Total area = area of the bed + area of additional fabric
   - Total area = 48 square feet + 80 square feet = 128 square feet.


 {The final answer is 128 square feet}. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet

Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'm' represent the number of letters delivered on Monday. 
* Let 't' represent the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
* Let 'w' represent the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.

**Step 2: Formulate Equations**

* We are given:
  * m = 425 (letters delivered on Monday)
  * t = m + 17 + (1/5)m (Deliveries on Tuesday are 17 more than one-fifth of the Monday delivery)
  * w = 2t + 5 (Deliveries on Wednesday are 5 more than twice the Tuesday delivery)
 
* Now we have 3 equations with 3 unknowns.

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**

* To get the final answer, we need to solve the equations and isolate each variable :
 
 **Equation 1 (m) is known:** m=425 
 
 **Equation 2 (t) is known:** t = m + 17 + (1/5)m 
 

**Equation 3 (w) is known:** w = 2t + 5 




**Step 4: Substitute and Simplify**


* Substitute the value of 'm' from equation 1 into equation 2 and simplify to get the value of 't'. 
* Similarly, substitute the value of 't' from equation 2 into equation 3 to get the value of 'w.' 

**Step 5: Final Calculation**


* Add together the values of letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total number of letters delivered. 



**Final Answer:** {The final answer is

On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second , race. How much did he lose on average that day?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Find the winnings in the second race:**

* Twice the amount lost on the first race: $5 * 2 = $10
* Winnings in the second race: $10 + $1 = $11

**2. Find the loss in the third race:**

*  1.5 times the winnings in the second race: $11 * 1.5 = $16.50

**3. Find the total loss for the day:**

* Total loss: $5 + $16.50 = $21.50

**4. Calculate the average loss:**

* Average loss: $21.50 / 3 races = $7.17


 {The final answer is $7.17} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11

He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

**Solution**

1. **Calculate Xavier's new height:** 
   *  Xavier's growth is 3 inches. 
   *  4 feet = 48 inches 
   *   3 inches + 48 inches = 51 inches.
  
2. **Calculate Cole's new height:**

{The final answer is}
 
**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:**
   - Let 'x' be the share of the first person.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second person's share is 'x + $80'.
   - The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person's share is '2(x + $80)'.
   - The total amount divided among the three people is $1920, therefore: x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80) = $1920

3. **Solve the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:  x + x + $80 + 2x + $160 = $1920
   - Simplify: 4x + $240 = $1920
   - Subtract $240 from both sides: 4x = $1680
   - Divide both sides by 4: x = $420

4. **State the answer:**
   - The share of the first person is $420 {The final answer is $420}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.
The second took X+<<+80=80>>80.
The third took (X+80)*2.

X + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920
X*4 + 240 = 1920.
X*4 = 1680.

Here's how we can tackle this:

**Step 1:  Calculate the total working days**

*   3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days

**Step 2: Calculate the total work time**

*   21 days * (3/8) = 7.125 days

**Step 3:  Calculate the work time per painter**

*   7.125 days * (1 day/ 4 painters) = 1.78125 days/painter


**Step 4:  Adjust for hours** 

* Convert days to hours. (You might need some conversion factor)
  
{The final answer is 1.78125 hours/painter}


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 24 hours in a day so 3/8ths of a day is (3/8)*24 = <<3/8*24=9>>9 hours

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second. He retrieved 19 tennis balls in all. How many tennis balls did he retrieve in the first set of the match?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve it step-by-step:

**1.  Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

**2. Set up Equations:**

* **Third set:** Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls in the third set.
* **Total balls:** The first, second and third set together are represented by the total number of balls, which is 19 - x.


**3.  Combine Information:**

* Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set than in the second set: x + 4 

* **Therefore,  the equation becomes:**  x + 4 + x/2 + 19 - x = 19

**4.  Simplify and solve for x:**
 
* Combine like terms:   (x + x/2 )  + 23 = 19

* Find a common denominator: (3x/2)  + 23 = 19

* Subtract 23 from both sides: (3x/2) = -4
 
* Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = -8

* Divide both sides by 3: x = -8/3

This is a contradiction because the number of balls can't be negative. 



**The problem with the provided information is that it contradicts itself.** Rory retrieves a number that makes no numerical sense.   




<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the number of English books:**

   * Half of the books are in English, so there are 50 / 2 = 25 English books.

**2. Calculate the number of German books:**

   * 10% of the books are in German, so there are 50 * 0.10 = 5 German books.

**3. Calculate the number of books in other languages:**

   * Subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.  
   *  This gives you  50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books in other languages. 

**4. Determine the number of Spanish books:**

   * Since all the remaining books are Spanish, there are 20 Spanish books.


{The final answer is 20} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the running shorts:**

* The tank top cost $10.
* The shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

**2. Calculate the price of the sale tennis shoes:**

* The tennis shoes were originally $48.
* They were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.

**3. Calculate the total cost of the athletic gear without the socks:**

* Tank top cost: $10
* Running shorts cost: $15
* Tennis shoes cost: $24 
* This total: $10 + $15 + $24 = $59

**4. Calculate the cost of the athletic socks, including the coupon:**

* The socks cost $8. 
* Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

**5. Calculate the final total spent:**

* All the costs added up. 
* The final cost of the athletic gear is: $59 + $6= $65


 **The final answer is $65.**

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the problem**

* We have a kitchen floor with a certain area (we'll call it *A*).
* We want to add square tiles that have a particular size and cost per tile.
* We need to determine the cost of all the tiles.

**2. Define key terms**

*  *A* : The total area of the kitchen floor (in SqFt) 
*  *t* : The number of tiles we'll need 
*  *l* : The length of each tile (in feet).


**3. Calculate the number of tiles needed**

* We're not informed about the exact shape of the kitchen floor. 
* You'd need a more specific shape description (and potentially a floor plan) to determine the exact number of tiles needed. 


**4. Calculate the cost of the tiles**

*  The cost of each tile is determined to be $12.
*  To calculate the total cost, multiply the number of tiles (*t*) by the price per tile ($12/tile)



**5. Put it all together**

1. **Total Cost:** 
   * To find the total cost, we multiply the total area of the kitchen floor by the cost per tile.

**Key Considerations**

* **Floor Shape:**  Knowing the actual shape of the kitchen floor (square, rectangular, etc.) will allow for easier calculation.
* **Detailed Information:** More detailed information like the total length and width of the floor can help determine the exact number of tiles needed.

*The question requires understanding how to calculate periodic increase in price
**Answer:**
.

## Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Define the Baseline:**  
   *  We know the normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month. This is our baseline cost.

2. **Identify the Increase:**
   * The question tells us the cost increased by 60% due to the accident.
   * We need to find out how to calculate the percentage increase of $120. 

3. **Calculate the Increase Amount:**
   *  To find the increased cost, we multiply the  baseline cost by the percentage increase.
  
      * 60% of $120 = (60/100) * $120 = $72
   

4. **Calculate the New Cost:**
    *  We add the increase to the baseline cost to find the new monthly premium price. 
    *
     * New cost = Baseline cost + Increase Amount
     * New cost = $120 + $72 = $192

5. **Calculate the Yearly Cost:**
    *  We multiply the new monthly cost by 12 to get the yearly cost.
    * 
     * Yearly cost = New cost * 12
     * Yearly cost = $192 * 12 = $2304


**The Final Answer is $2304.**



<end_of_turn><eos>","The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal
So he paid 120+72=$<<120+72=192>>192 a month
That means he pays 12*192=$<<12*192=2304>>2304

How : many loads of ; laundry does : he do in a year?<end_of_turn>
*Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the problem.


**Step 1: Define the Variables**
* We need to figure out how many loads of laundry Greg does over a year.  
* Let's use these variables: 
    *  *x*  = The number of loads of laundry Greg does.


**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**
* We need to work out the number of sheet sets he washes per week.
* Twin beds: 4 sets * 2 sheets / set = 8 sheets
* King bed: 1 set * 1 sheet / set = 1 sheet
* Total sheet sets per week: 8 sheet + 1 sheet = 9 sheets
* We need to also add in how many times he does this work per week.
*  *Greg does 9 sheets per week.*
* We need to set up the equation to determine Greg does *x* loads in a year.


**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Loads of Laundry**

* We know that Greg washes 9 sheets per week and the machine will only allow for washing of 2 twin sets at a time.
* This means, he needs *x = ?* loads 

**Step 4: Convert Weekly Work to Yearly Work**
* There are 52 weeks in a year, so, *x = ?* loads of laundry over a year.
* *Greg does x loads of laundry over a year.*



**Step 5: Answer**
*The final answer is { Greg does 52 loads of laundry over a year }. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets
He does 2 loads of twin size sheets and 1 load for king size sheets every week for a total of 2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 loads
Over 52 weeks (1 year) he does 3 loads of laundry a week for a total of 52*3 = <<3*52=156>>156 loads of laundry

Here's the breakdown of how to solve this problem:

**Step 1: Figure out how many movies they watch on Sunday**
* They watch half as many movies on Sunday as Saturday: 4 movies / 2 = 2 movies 

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of movies watched per weekend**
* Total movies watched on Friday and Saturday: 4 movies
* Total movies watched on Sunday: 2 movies
* Total movies watched per weekend: 4 movies + 2 movies = 6 movies 

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks**
* They watch 6 movies per weekend in total.
* Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 6 movies/week * 4 weeks = 24 movies

 **The final answer is:** 24 movies. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.
They watch a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 movies every weekend.
Therefore, they can watch 6 x 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 movies in four weeks.

Here's the breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Context:** Leo collects stickers over time.
* **Key Information:** 
    * Two years ago, he had 100 stickers.
    * Last year, he collected 50 stickers.
    * This year, he collected twice the amount from the previous year. 

**Step 1: Determine the Stickers Last Year** 

* We need to find out how many stickers Leo had at some point in the two years before last year.

**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Stickers This Year**

*  We are given that this year, Leo collected twice the amount from last year.

**Step 3: Establish a Relationship Between Quantities**

*  We need to figure out how many stickers Leo has overall.

**Final Step: Combining Information to Determine Total Stickers** 
   
* By combining information from steps 1 and 2, we can find out how many stickers Leo has in his collection this year. 

Let me know when you want to start working through the calculations. 




<end_of_turn><eos>","Last year, Leo had 100 +50 = <<100+50=150>>150.
This year, he collected 2 x 50 = <<2*50=100>>100.

*A*

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the knowns:**
   * Number of cats: 3
   * Feeding frequency: twice a day
   * Amount of food per feeding: 60 grams

2. **Calculate the total amount of food consumed per day:**
   * 3 cats * 60 grams/feeding = 180 grams of cat food per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days the food will last:**
   * 720 grams / 180 grams/day = 4 days. 


**The final answer is: 4 days**   
<end_of_turn><eos>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

{The final answer is}

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate Jake's slices:**
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, and Becky ate 10 slices. 
   - Therefore, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.

2. **Calculate Silvia's slices:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, who ate 7 slices. 
   - Silvia ate 2 * 7 = 14 slices.

3. **Calculate total slices:**
   - They ate a total of 8 slices/pizza * 4 pizzas = 32 slices.
   - They ate 10 slices + 7 slices + 14 slices = 31 slices.

Here's how we can solve this:

**1. Define the variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the time Donovan spent on the meal.
* Betsy's time will be 'x + 18' minutes (because it takes 18 minutes longer than Donovan's time).

**2. Set up the equation:**

* The total time for the meal is the sum of Betsy's part and Donovan's part.
* We know the total time is 98 minutes:  x + (x + 18) = 98

**3. Solve the equation:**

* Combine like terms on the left side: 2x + 18 = 98
* Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

**4. Calculate Betsy's part:**

*  Betsy's part is x + 18, so Betsy's part is 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.


{The final answer is 58 minutes} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98

Here's how we can break down the problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response.**

* 20% of 80 emails = (20/100) * 80 = 16 emails.

**Step 2:  Calculate the number of emails that require a response.**

* 80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a work week**

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club:**

*   They ordered 20 pizzas.
*   They ate 70% of them, which means they ate 0.70 * 20 = 14 pizzas.

**2. Calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team:**

*   They ordered twice as many as the glee club, so they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.
 
**3. Calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the football team:**

*   They ate 80% of those pizzas, meaning they ate 0.80 * 40 = 32 pizzas. 

**4. Calculate the total number of pizzas eaten:** 

*  Combined, they ate 14 pizzas + 32 pizzas = 46 pizzas.

**5. Calculate the number of pizzas remaining:**

*   They started with 20 pizzas and ate 46 pizzas, leaving 20 - 46 = -26 pizzas.

**6. Check the answer:** This result doesn't make sense.  


**Final answer**: The problem has an error in the information given.

Then multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the glee club ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 30% * 20 pizzas = <<30*.01*20=6>>6 pizzas
Then multiply the number of pizzas the glee club ordered by 2 to find the number the football team ordered: 20 pizzas * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 pizzas
Then find the percentage of pizzas left from the football team: 100% - 80% = 20%
Then multiply that percentage by the number of pizzas the football team ordered to find the number of pizzas left: 20% * 40 pizzas = <<20*.01*40=8>>8 pizzas
Then add the number of pizzas left from each group to find the total number left: 8 pizzas + 6 pizzas = <<8+6=14>>14 pizzas

Let's tackle this problem step by step then present the final answer. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.
Out of the 20 trucks dispatched to deliver fertiliser, 20-5 = <<20-5=15>>15 trucks delivered to the farmers.
Since each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of tons of fertiliser delivered that day was 15*20 = <<15*20=300>>300 tons.

The grocery store currently has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half : off.  If the butter , costs $4.00 . a pound, how much will it cost him to purchase 6 ? pounds of , butter?<end_of_turn>
* 
 
 Solution:
 
 1. **Calculate the total butter needed:** Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every 12 croissants. He needs to make 6 dozen croissants, so he'll need 1 pound/12 croissants * 6 dozen croissants = 0.5 pounds of butter.
2. **Apply the discounted price:**  The sale gives him 1 pound of butter for $4.00. The discount is a 50% off, so he is paying $4.00 - ($4.00 * 0.5) = $2.00 per pound of butter.
3. **Final answer:** The final answer is { $2.00 per pound

<end_of_turn><eos>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter
The butter is $4.00 a pound and currently on sale for buy one get one half off so every unit of 2 pounds of butter will cost 4*1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6.00>>6.00
He needs 6 pounds of butter and the current promotion is for a unit of 2 pounds of butter so he needs to buy 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 units worth of butter
The sale price is $6.00 per 2 pounds of butter and he needs to buy 3 units of butter so 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 worth of butter

How ; much , will . the party ? cost?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Find the total number of guests.** 

* Kayla's classmates: 25
* Dance class girls: 7
* Family members: 13
* Guests who can't come: 4
* Total guests: 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41 guests

**2. Calculate additional guest fees.**

* Since the fee is $6 per additional guest, and there are 41 guests! 
* The additional guest fees are$41 - 20 = $21

**3. Calculate the total party cost.**

* The baseline fee is $125.
* The total additional guest fees are $21.
* The total party cost is $125 + $21 = $146 . 


{The final answer is $146}<end_of_turn><eos>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

*To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money each person spent*.


**Step 1**: 
* Define the variables.
* Let 'x' represent the initial amount of money Maggie had.
* Let 'y' represent the initial amount of money Riza had.

**Step 2**: 
* Translate the problem information into equations.
* Maggie spent one-quarter of her initial amount: x/4
* Riza spent one-third of her initial amount: y/3
* Each spent $60: x/4 = 60  and   y/3 = 60

**Step 3**: 
* Solve the equations to find the initial amounts of money for each.
* Since we're working with fractions, we can simplify to find the initial amounts for each:
 * x/4 = 60 => x = 240
 * y/3 = 60 => y = 180

**Step 4**:
* Determine their final amounts of money
* Their final amounts are the initial amounts minus the spent amounts
* Maggie's final amount: 240 - 60 = 180 
* Riza's final amount: 180 - 60 = 120

**Step 5**:
* Calculate the final total amount of money they have left
* Total final amount: 180 + 120 = 300

 


{The final answer is 300} . 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.
Riza spent $60/3 = $<<60/3=20>>20.
So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.
Thus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.

**Solution:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let  'M1' represent the number of bananas the first monkey eats per day.
   * Let 'M2' represent the number of bananas the second monkey eats per day. 
   * Let 'M3' represent the number of bananas the third monkey eats per day.

2. **Set up equations based on given information:**  
   *  M1 = 10 bananas (given)
   *  M2 = M1 + 4 (the second monkey eats 4 more than the first)
   *  M3 = 315 - M1 - M2 (the third monkey eats the rest)
   
3. **Solve for the third monkey's bananas:**
   *  We know that the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas, so we can calculate that: 
      * M3 = 315 - 10 - (M1 + 4)
   * Simplify M3: 
      * M3 = 315 - 10 - 10 - 4 = 301


4. **The final answer is:** {The third monkey eats 301 bananas each day.} 

 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate total toothpicks saved:**

* Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week for 12 weeks, so she saves 10 toothpicks/week * 12 weeks = 120 toothpicks.

**2. Determine how many weeks are needed at the same rate:**

*  Melanie needs 200 toothpicks. 
*  She has already saved 120 toothpicks.
* It will take her 200 toothpicks / 120 toothpicks/week = 1.6667 weeks

**3. Round to the nearest week:**

*  Since Melanie needs 1.6667 weeks it will take her  **2 weeks**

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem:**

* We are dealing with a scenario where springs create new jellyfish every second. 
* We need to find out the number of jellyfish produced in 4 hours.
* The rate of jellyfish creation is constant from each spring.

**2.  Calculate the rate of jellyfish production per hour:**

* There are 60 minutes in an hour.
* Since a spring creates a jellyfish every second, in 1 hour, it would produce 60 seconds / 1 second = 60 jellyfish.

**3. Calculate the number of jellyfish produced in 4 hours:**

* Multiply the jellyfish produced per hour by the number of hours.
*  60 jellyfish/hour * 4 hours = 240 jellyfish

 {The final answer is 240 jellyfish} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

If ! his ! home : is , 4 miles from the store , and he walks ? 4 miles per hour how ! long did it take him : to reach the store?<end_of_turn>


Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1. Clarify the Information**

* We know the store is 4 miles away from James's home.
* We know James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
* James gets halfway there, then has to walk back. This means we need to know the distance he traveled to the halfway point. 


**2. Define the Stages**

* **Stage 1:** James makes his way towards the store. 
*  **Stage 2:** He walks back home from the halfway point. 

**3. Determine Distance Covered in Stage 1**

* We need to find out how far James walked before he turned around. 

**4. Determine Total Time for Stage 1**

* Using the calculated distance and his speed.

**5. Determine Time for Stage 2**

* Using his walking speed.

**6.  Calculate Total Time**



Let me know if you would like help with any of the specific calculations!
<end_of_turn><eos>","He walked 4/2=<<4/2=2>>2 miles there before turning around
So in total he walked 2+2+4=<<2+2+4=8>>8 miles, he walked 2 miles to the halfway point than 2 miles home.
That means it took him 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 hours

Here's how we can solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the total number of bananas:**

* Jenny buys 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas

**2. Calculate the cost of buying bananas individually:**

* 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00

**3. Calculate the cost of buying bananas in bunches:**

* 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00

**4. Calculate the savings:**

* $32.00 (cost individually) - $30.00 (cost in bunches) = $2.00 


**The final answer is $2.00** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.
There are 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 bananas.
40 bananas would cost 40*0.80=$<<40*0.80=32>>32 individually.
She saved 32-30=<<32-30=2>>2 dollars

                    question:
                    ? If Sam ; and Harry ; have , 100 feet of fence : between them, . and they ! agree to . split it ! with Harry : getting 60 feet more ? than ? Sam, how much is left over . for Sam?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the fence Sam has. 
* Let 'x + 60' represent the length of the fence Harry has. 

**Step 2: Formulate the Equation**

* The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so:  x + (x + 60) = 100

**Step 3: Solve for x**

* Combine like terms: 2x + 60 = 100
* Subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40
* Divide both sides by 2: x = 20

**Step 4: Calculate Harry's Fence Length**

* Harry's fence is x + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80 feet. 

**Step 5: Find the Portion Left Over for Sam**

* Sam has 20 feet of fence. 
* The remaining portion for Sam is his fence length minus Harry's: 20 - 80 = -60


**Step 6: Interpret the Answer** 


* The answer indicates that there is a discrepancy in the problem.  A person cannot have a negative amount of fence.


{The answer cannot be obtained as there's an inconsistency in the provided information. } 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2x+60=100
Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

                    ? A crocodile grows 8 ? inches long in 4 years. . At . this rate, how ! many inches will it grow in 13 years?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Identify the relationship.** The question tells us how much the crocodile grows in one year: 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches per year.

2. **Set up a proportion.** To find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we can set up a proportion.
    *  Let 'x' represent the total length the crocodile will grow in 13 years.
    * Proportion: (growth per year) * (number of years) = (final length)

    This can be written as: 2 inches / 1 year = x inches / 13 years 

3. **Solve for x.**  We can solve for x by cross-multiplication:
    * 2 inches * 13 years = 1 year * x inches
    * 26 inches = x inches

4. **The final answer is:**26 inches.

<eos>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - They work for 6 hours.
   - Total bales produced: 5 bales/hour * 6 hours = 30 bales

**2. Calculate the total bales picked up by the truck:**

   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - They work for 6 hours.
   - Total bales picked up: 3 bales/hour * 6 hours = 18 bales

**3. Find the difference between the farmer's and truck's output:**

   - The farmer produces 30 bales.
   - The truck picks up 18 bales.

Here's how we can step-by-step solve this problem:

**1. Calculate John's total class time per week:**

* He takes 2 extra classes, at 40 minutes each, per class is 40 minutes
* Total class time per week is 2 classes * 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes.


**2. Calculate his class time per day:**

* He attends classes 5 days a week
* Total class time per week: 80 minutes/week * 5 days = 400 minutes

**3. Calculate his learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**

* He spends 1/16 of his weekly time on weekends.
* Hours on Saturday and Sunday = (1/16) * 400 minutes
 


**4. Convert minutes to hours:**

* 400 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 6.67 hours.

 
**5. Total weekly time spent learning.**

Here's the breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Understand the Bounce Pattern**

* Nathan's bouncy ball bounces to 2/3rds of its original height on each bounce. 

**Step 2: Determine the Height after the First Bounce**

* The ball starts at the third-floor balcony (24 feet high). 
*  After the first bounce, it's at 2/3 * 24 feet = 16 feet.

**Step 3: Determine the Height after the Second Bounce**

* The ball starts at 16 feet high. 
* After the second bounce, it's at 2/3 * 16 feet = 10.67 feet {We round this to 10.67 feet since the question is asking for a whole number}



**Step 4: Final Answer** 
The ball goes {10.67 feet} high on its second bounce.

*The information is in the problem itself.* 

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:** The problem involves a food chain with different animals involved in the eating and scavenging process. 
2. **Identify key information:**  We know:
   * T-Rex ate half of a triceratops. 
   * Velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. 
   * Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   * We want to find the original amount of meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate anything. 
3. **Apply strategic thinking:** We can work backwards to find the original amount of meat. This means focusing on the sequence of events. 
4. **Working backward**:
   * The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, this likely means that something else was the original source of the food, before the T-Rex. 
   * We know the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. 


**Final answer:**  {The initial amount of meat on the Triceratops was 540 kilograms }

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.
The T-Rex ate half the meat, so there were 540 * 2 = <<540*2=1080>>1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops.

1. **Calculate the area of each wall:**
    * North & South Wall: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 square feet
    * East & West Wall: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 square feet 

2. **Calculate the total area of all four walls:**

3. **Calculate the amount of paint needed:**
     * Number of Gallons: 120 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 6 gallons

4. **Calculate the total cost of the paint:**
    * Cost: 6 gallons * $12 per gallon = $72


**Therefore, it will cost $72 to paint the room.**



<end_of_turn><eos>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40
The south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160
The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12
It will cost $144 because 12 x 12 = <<12*12=144>>144

**Solution:** 
1. **Define Variables:**
   * Let `x` be the distance between the two trains after 3 hours.
   * Let `t` be the distance each train travels during 3 hours.  

2. **Determine the Distance Traveled by each Train:**
   * Train 1: Travels for 3 hours at a rate of 60 miles/hour, so the distance traveled by train 1 is `3 * 60 = 180 miles`. 

   * Train 2: Travels for 3 hours at a rate of 30 miles/hour, so the distance traveled by train 2 is `3 * 30 = 90 miles`. {Note: This assumes that they travel for a uniform period} 

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
  * We can denote the initial distance between the two trains as the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
  * The distance each train travels after 3 hours then forms the horizontal legs of the triangle
  

{The final answer is}

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Determine Billy's work hours per day:**

* He can help 2 people per hour.
* He works for 3 hours per day.
* So, he helps 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people per day.

**2. Calculate the number of working days between March 1st and April 19th:**

* March has 31 days.
* Billy takes 20% off, meaning he works 31 days * 0.20 = 6.2 days.

**3. Determine the number of working days:**
* Working days are the days between March 1st and April 19th, excluding his days off.  

**4. Calculate the number of people he actively helps:**

* He helps 6 people per day.
* He works 31-6.2 = 24.8 days (rounding)
* Total people he helps = 6 people/day * 24.8 days = {**149.6**


<end_of_turn><eos>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

Here's the breakdown of our thought steps:

1. **Identify the information given.**
   -  There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.
   -  Buses carried 35 people each.
   -  Cars carried 3 people each.

2. **Define the unknown variable.**
   -  We need to find out how many people were inside the church.

3. **Set up the equation.**
   -  We need a way to combine the information about the buses and cars to find the total number of people. 
   -  Let's use the following equation: Total church people = (bus people) + (car people).

4. **Apply the information to the equation.**
   -  Bus people: 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people
   -  Car people: 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

5. **Calculate the total church people.**

Let's break down the solution:

**Step 1: Define the unknown**

We need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank.  Let's represent the total number of jellyfish as ""x"".

**Step 2: Set up the fraction based problem**

* **Large jellyfish:**  A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so 1/5 * x. 
* **Large jellyfish changing color:** A third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue, so (1/3) * (1/5) * x.
* **Small jellyfish:** The other (4/5) - (1/3) * (1/5) * x.

**Step 3: Apply the information about the UV light incident**

When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color.  

Therefore (1/3) * (1/5) * x = 6


**Step 4: Solve for the number of jellyfish in the tank**

*  Multiply both sides of the equation by 3, 5, and  x.
*  The equation becomes 2x/15 = 6 
*  Multiply both sides of the equation by 15.
*  That is 2x = 90


**The final answer is:** x = {45}

**Solution:**

1. **Define the units:** We know Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and must cut it into 4 equal parts.  This tells us the entire piece of ribbon is our base unit.

2. **Determine the number of smaller parts:** Each of these smaller parts must be divided into 5 equal parts, thus needing 5 units for the smaller parts. 
    
3. **Calculate the length of each smaller part:** 
    * The base unit is 100 centimeters. 
    * Each smaller part has 5 equal parts.
    * Therefore, each smaller part is 100 centimeters / 5 = 20 centimeters.

4.  **To complete the larger part:** In order for the larger part to have a consistent measurement, dividing the smaller part evenly into 4 equals.

                    How many girls . are in the school if . 40% of : a school : population , is ; made up of 240 . boys?<end_of_turn>
* This is a classic percentage problem. 


**Solution:**
1. **Identify the known information:**
    - Percentage of boys: 40%
    - Number of boys: 240

2. **Set up the equation:**
    - Since 40% of the school population is boys, we can set up the proportion:
        (Fraction of boys) / (Total population) = (Boys) / (Total population)
        This can be simplified to: 0.40 = 240 / (Total population)

3. **Solve for the total population:**
    - To get the total population, multiply both sides of the equation by the total population:
        0.40 * Total population = 240
     - Divide both sides by 0.40 to isolate the total population:
        Total population = 240 / 0.40 = 600 


4. **Calculate the number of girls:**
    - Subtract the number of boys from the total population to get the number of girls:
        Total girls = Total population - Number of boys 
        Total girls = 600 - 240 = 360

 {The final answer is 360} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

   * We also know that three out of the total number of women are wearing 2-inch heels, so: u = 3

**3. Calculate the Average Heel Height**
   * The average heel height is calculated by: (total wearers of 4-inch heels) + (total wearers of 2-inch heels) / (total number of women at the party).
   * We can use this to calculate the average heel height.
 


**4. Final Answer**
 {The final answer is}

 


**Explanation:**
* This problem uses basic algebra and understanding of ratios to solve for the number of women wearing 4-inch heels and 2-inch heels. 


Let me know if you'd like any further clarification or have another problem you'd like me to help you work through. <end_of_turn><eos>","First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches
Then find the total number of inches from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches
Then add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches
Then find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women
Then divide the total number of heel inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches / woman

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Calculate the total miles Soledad wants to hike:**

* She plans to hike 9,300 miles in June.

**2. Calculate how many miles she will hike each day:**

* She plans to hike 2 times a day * 125 miles/time = 250 miles per day.

**3. Calculate how many more miles per day she needs:**

* 9,300 miles / 250 miles/day = 37.2 days


**The final answer is 37.2 more miles.**

*Note: The question uses informal language, so we need to apply careful reasoning and solve for the exact answers.*
 


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Calculate how much apple Pierre wants:**

* Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples, so he wants (1/4) * 12 kg = 3 kg 

**2. Calculate how much apple Paul wants:**

* Paul wants 1/3 of the total apples. So, he wants (1/3) * 12 kg = 4 kg

**3.  Find the total amount of apples Pierre and Paul want:**

* Together, Pierre and Paul want 3 kg + 4 kg = 7 kg. 

**4. Determine how much apples are left:**

*  They start with 12 kg. and they want 7 kg.  So, the apples left is 12 kg - 7 kg = 5 kg.


 **The final answer is:** 5 kg. 
 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.

If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1.  Find the weight of Elijah's dog:**

* One-fourth the weight of Kory's dog is 60 lbs * (1/4) = 15 lbs. 

**2. Find the weight of Elijah's other dog:**

* Elijah’s other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so its weight is 60 lbs * (1/2) = 30 lbs. 

**3. Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs.**

*  Elijah’s dogs together weigh 15 lbs + 30 lbs = 45 lbs.

**4. Calculate the total weight of Kory's dog and Elijah's dogs** 

* Together they weigh 60 lbs + 45 lbs = 105 lbs.


{The final answer is 105 pounds} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds

{The final answer is}

Let's break this problem down step by step:

**1.  Understand the Process**

* We're given a chain of transactions. Each step describes a change in the number of stickers.
* We want to find the original number of stickers Seth had.


**2. Define Variables**

* Let 'S' represent the number of stickers Seth had originally.

**3. Set up the Equations**

* **Step 1:** Seth gave half to Luis.  
   *  S / 2 to Luis
* **Step 2:** Luis used half.
   *  Luis's stickers = S/2 / 2 = S/4
* **Step 3:** Luis gave someone the rest.
   *  Rest given to Kris = S/4 
* **Step 4:** Kris kept some and gave some to Rob.
   *  Kris's stickers = S/4 - 9
   *  Rob's stickers = (S/4- 9) / 7 



**4.  Work Through the Equations**

*  We'll need to keep track of all the stickers exchanged throughout. 
*  Work backward from each step and use the information from the previous step to solve for the original number of stickers. 



**5. Final Answer** 



 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.
Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris which means that he had 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 stickers.
Seth had 32 x 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 stickers.

Let's break down this problem step by step.

**Understanding the Problem**

Rani wants to find how fast the fastest sports car goes.  Here's what we know:

* **Fastest car:** 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
* **2nd fastest car:** 5 times faster than the average car.
* **Average car:** 120 miles per hour.

**Step 1: Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car**

* The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
* This means the 2nd fastest car goes at 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the speed of the fastest car**

* The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
* So, the fastest car goes at 1.25 * 600 = 750 miles per hour.

 {The final answer is 750 miles per hour.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The 2nd fastest car can go 600 MPH because 5 x 120 = <<5*120=600>>600
The faster car can go 750 MPH because 1.25 x 600 = <<1.25*600=750>>750

Liam's age two years ago was ... 
Vince's age two years ago was ... 
Liam's age now is ...
Vince's age now is ...




Here's the breakdown of the problem solving process:

**1. Define variables:**

*  Let Liam's current age be ""L""
*  Let Vince's current age be ""V""

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  **""Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince.""** 
   * This means: L - 2 = 2(V - 2)
   
**3. Solve the equation for Liam's current age (L):**

*  **Simplify the equation:** L - 2 = 2V - 4
*  **Isolate L:** L = 2V - 2

**4. Use the given information to solve for Vince's current age (V):**

*  **Liam's current age (L) is 16:** So, L = 16 
*  **Substitute L in the equation:** 16 = 2V - 2
*  **Isolate V:**
    * 16 + 2 = 2V
    * 18 = 2V
    *  V = 9

**5. Final Answer:**

*  Vince's age now is 9 {The final answer is 9}

 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Define variables:**

*  Let  'A' represent the number of eggs Arnold painted.
*  Let 'M' represent the number of eggs Madeline painted.
*  Let 'C' represent the number of eggs Camden painted.
*  Let 'S' represent the number of eggs Sarah painted.
 

**2. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*  Equation 1:  A + M = 56  (The total number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline)
*  Equation 2:  C + S = 30  (The total number of eggs painted by Camden and Sarah)
*  Equation 3:  C = S + 12   (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah).

**3. Solve for the variables:**

* **Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:** 
   C + S = 30
   (S + 12) + S = 30
   2S + 12 = 30
* **Solve for S:** 
   2S = 18
   S = 9
* **Substitute the value of S into Equation 3 to find C:** 
   C = 9 + 12
   C = 21
* **Substitute the values of A, M, C, and S into Equation 1 to solve for M:** 
   A + M = 56
   A + M = 56 

 


 


{The final answer is 12}<end_of_turn><eos>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.

If he puts all : of his crayons into boxes, what is the total weight, in pounds, of the crayons and the boxes, when there are 16 ounces to , a pound?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of groups:** 
   - Nik has 200 crayons and wants to put them in groups of 8, so divide the number of crayons by the size of each group:  200 crayons / 8 crayons/group = 25 groups.

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons per group:**
   - Calculate the total weight of 8 crayons: 8 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 8 ounces.

3. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Multiply the weight per group by the number of groups: 8 ounces/group * 25 groups = 200 ounces

4. **Convert ounces to pounds:**
   - Divide the total ounces by the conversion factor: 200 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 12.5 pounds.


{The final answer is 12.5 pounds.}<end_of_turn><eos>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the usable volume:**
    * John gets 80% of the tree's volume into logs. 
    * This means he gets 0.80 * 80 ft = 64 ft³ of usable volume into logs.
2. **Calculate the number of logs:**
    * Each 4-foot log represents a unit of usable volume.
    * So, he gets 64 ft³ / 4 ft³/log = 16 logs
3. **Calculate the number of planks from each log:**
    * He gets 5 planks from each log. 
    * So, he gets 16 logs * 5 planks/log = 80 planks 
4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
    * He sells each plank for $1.2.
    * So, his final earnings are 80 planks * $1.2/plank = $96


 {The final answer is $96.} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.
That gives him16*5=<<16*5=80>>80 planks.
So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.

Here's how we can break down the problem and solve for the final answer:

**1. Beach Walking Speed:**

* Grandma walks at a slower rate on the beach. 
* We need to figure out her speed on the beach.

**2. Sidewalk Walking Speed:**

* Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as on the beach.
* We need to figure out her speed on the sidewalk

**3. Calculate Time on Beach:**

* First, find the time spent walking on the beach.


 
**4. Time on the Sidewalk:**
* Find the time taken to walk the full 1 mile of sidewalk. 
 
**5. Calculate Total Time**
* Combine the times from each section.

<end_of_turn><eos>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the total savings over 8 weeks:**

* Jane saves $4 each week.
* Total savings over 8 weeks = $4/week * 8 weeks = $32

**2. Determine how much more is needed:**

*  Total savings needed = $60.
*  Amount still needed = $60 - $32 = $28

**3. Figure out how many weeks it would take if she saves $4 every week:**

* Total savings needed is $28.
*  Therefore, it will take 7 weeks.

    * ""If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles."" This can be written as: `M + 2 * 12 = 60` 
    * ""If he loses 10 marbles of the marbles he has"", which means: `M - 10 = ? `

**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Marbles**


* **Step 2a:** Solve for `M` in the first equation. 
   *  `M + 24 = 60`
   *  `M = 60 - 24`
   *  `M = 36` 

* **Step 2b:** Substitute the value of `M` to find the number of marbles he will have after losing 10 
   * `M -10 = 36 - 10`
   * `M - 10 = 26`

**Final Answer: ** {The final answer is 26}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.
So after receiving 2 dozen more marbles, we know B + 24 = 60.
This means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.
Bob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the total cost of the bagels before the discount:**

* Cost per pack: $10.00
* Number of packs: 4
* Total cost before discount: $10.00 * 4 = $40.00

**2. Calculate the discount amount:**

* Discount percentage: 10%
* Total cost before discount: $40.00
* Discount amount: $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00

**3. Calculate the final cost of the bagels:** 

* Total cost before discount: $40.00
* Discount amount: $4.00
* Final cost: $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

**4. Calculate the price of one bagel:**

* Cost per pack: $10.00
* Number of bagels per pack: 9
* Price per bagel:  $10.00 / 9 = $1.11 (rounded to two decimal places) 



{The final answer is $1.11} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","He orders 4 packs of bagels and each pack costs $10.00 so that's 4*10 = $<<4*10=40.00>>40.00
He orders 4 packs at $40.00 and receives a 10% discount so his discount is 40*.10 = $4.00
The bagels cost $40.00 and he has a $4.00 discount making his total 40-4 = $<<40-4=36.00>>36.00
Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels

2. **Translate the Given Information into Equations:**
   * The problem provides multiple statements that can be translated into equations. 
   * The statement ""Gomer ate . 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes"" translates to x=23-0.5x 
   * The statement ""If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes"" translates to 6-3 = 3


3. **Solve the Equations:**
   * We can solve equations for the variable 'x' using simple operations. 
 

4. **Find the Number of Potatoes:**
   * Once we know the number of scoops eaten (x), using the original information, we can find the number of potatoes.


 **Conclusion:**


    {The final answer is}

<end_of_turn><eos>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

*Note:  the question is asking for the number of women who remained on the bus*


Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define the Initial Ratio:** 
    * The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. 

2. **Determine the Initial Proportions:**
    *  Let 'm' be the initial number of men and 'w' be the initial number of women.
    * The proportions are represented as: m/w = 5/9

3. **Set up the Equation:**
    * We are given the total number of passengers is 84:  m + w = 84 

4. **Solve for one variable in terms of the other:** 
   * From the proportion m/w = 5/9 , we can solve for 'm' :
   * m = (5/9)w

5. **Substitute the Value into the Total Passengers Equation:** 
    * We have the equation m + w = 84.
    * Substitute (5/9)w for 'm' in the equation: ((5/9)w) + w = 84
 
6. **Solve for 'w':**
   * Combine 'w' terms:  (5/9)w + w = 84
   * Find a common denominator: (5w + 9w) / 9 = 84
   * Simplify: (14w) / 9 = 84
   * Multiply both sides by 9: 14w = 756
   * Divide both sides by 14: w = 54
   


7. **Calculate Remaining Women:**
   * After 20 women alight, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women remaining 



{The final answer is 34}<end_of_turn><eos>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14
The fraction from the ratio representing the number of women is 9/14, and since the total number of passengers representing the full ratio is 84, there are 9/14*84=<<9/14*84=54>>54 women on the bus.
If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of women remaining on the bus becomes 54-20=<<54-20=34>>34

1. **Identify the known information:**
    * Each sunflower cost: $2
    * Bouquet cost: $8
    * Daily earnings from sunflowers: $26
    * Daily earnings from bouquets: $56
    * Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.

2. **Determine the number of bouquets sold:**
    * Earnings from bouquets ÷ Price per bouquet = Number of bouquets
    * $56 ÷ $8 = 7 bouquets 

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold:**
    * Number of bouquets * Number of sunflowers per bouquet = Total sunflowers sold
    * 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers


4. **Calculate the total sunflowers sold over three days:**
    * Total sunflowers sold per day * Number of days = Total sunflowers sold
    * 84 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 252 sunflowers 


 {The final answer is 252 sunflowers} 
 

<end_of_turn><eos>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.

**2. Determine the total daily food costs**

* Jen needs $1 worth of food for each fish.
* She needs food for 3 fish each day.
* The total daily food cost is 3 * $1 = $3

**3. Calculate the total food costs for the month of May**

* May has 31 days.
* The total food cost for may is the daily cost multiplied by the number of days.
* The total food cost for may is $3/day x 31 days = $93


{The final answer is $93}

*Understanding the problem:* 
*  Breakdown the problem step-by-step:

1. **Start with the initial number of roses.** Patricia began with 30 roses.
2. **Calculate how many roses she gave to her mother.** She gave away 24 roses.
3. **Calculate her remaining roses after giving some away.** 30 - 24 = 6 roses.
4. **Add the new roses she bought.** 6 + 15 = 21 roses.


*The final answer is 21 roses.*

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Sid's first speed**

* **Distance:** 110 miles (already given)
* **Time:** 2 hours (already given)
* **Speed = Distance / Time**
* **Speed = 110 miles / 2 hours **
* **Speed = 55 miles per hour**

**2. Find the distance travelled in the second stage**

* The problem tells us Sid travelled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. 
 
**3. Find the total travel time**
* **Time = 3 hours** 

**4.  Find the total distance covered**
* **Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2** 
* **Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles**
* **Total distance = 250 miles**

**5. Calculate the average speed**
* **Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time** 
* **Average Speed = 250 miles / 3 hours**
* **Average Speed = 83.33 miles per hour (rounded)**




{The final answer is 83.33 miles per hour} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total
Since he spends 3 hours traveling after the first 2 hours, he traveled 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 hours
On average, Sid traveled 250 miles / 5 hours = <<250/5=50>>50 miles per hour.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Define the probabilities:**

*  Let 'p' be the probability of Mark winning the first ticket.
*  Let 'q' be the probability of Mark winning the second ticket.

**2. Translate the given information into probabilities:**

*  **First ticket:** The chance of winning is 20%. This means: p = 0.20 
*  **Second ticket:** The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so the probability of winning is three times the probability of winning the first ticket: q = 3p

**3. Determine the probability of both winning:**

*   To find the probability of both tickets winning, we need to multiply the probabilities of each ticket together.
    *  P(Both win) = P(First win) * P(Second win)

    *  P(Both win) = p * q

**4. Substitute the probabilities:**

*   P(Both win) = (0.20) * (3p) 

**5. Simplify the equation:**

*   P(Both win) = 0.6p


**6.  Find the probability of BOTH tickets win:**
*  We know p = 0.20 
*  P(Both win) = 0.6 * 0.20

**7. Calculate the final answer:**
*   P(Both win) = 0.12

{The final answer is  12%}. 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6
Then multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%

{The Final answer is}

Let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Find out how many seashells Carlos collected.**
   * We know Jim collected 27 seashells and that's 5 more than Carlos's collection.
   *  Let's represent Carlos's seashells as ""C"" 
   * Therefore, C = 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

**2. Find out how many seashells Carrey collected.**
*  We know Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey.
*  Carrey's collection is represented as ""C""
*   Therefore, C = 22 / 2 = 11 seashells

**3. Find the total number of seashells gathered.**
*  We found that Jim collected 27 shells, Carlos collected 22, and Carrey collected 11
*  Therefore, the total number of seashells = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells

**4.  Find out how many seashells were divided equally.**
*  They divided the total shells equally among themselves.
*  Let's represent the final division as ""D"" = 60 / 4
 

 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells
Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey did, meaning Carrey collected 22/2 = <<22/2=11>>11 seashells
In total, they collected 27+22+11 = <<27+22+11=60>>60 seashells

Weekday carrots : ______
Weekend carrots: ______
Total carrots: _______

This is a simple word problem, and these strategies should be implemented.
 


## Solution:

1. **Identify the Given Information:**  We are told:
   * Mason eats 4 carrots per weekday.
   * He eats 5 carrots per day on Saturday and Sunday.

2. **Break it Down:**  We need to find out the total carrots eaten per week. This requires breaking the information down:
   * **Weekday Carrots:**  Mason eats 4 carrots per day, and there are 5 weekdays per week.
   * **Weekend carrots:**   Mason eats 5 carrots per day on Saturday and Sunday, for 2 days.

3. **Calculate:**  
    * **Weekday Carrots:** 4 carrots/day * 5 days/week = 20 carrots
    * **Weekend Carrots:** 5 carrots/day * 2 days/week = 10 carrots
 
4. **Total carrots:**

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Understand the Problem**

* We're given two songs on a cassette tape. 
* The first song is 5 minutes long. 
* The second song is 60% longer than the first song.  

**2. Calculate the Length of the Longer Song**

* 60% of the first song's length is the longer song's length. 
* To calculate the longer song's length, we can convert the percentage into a decimal: 60/100 = 0.60

**3.  Calculate the Length of the Longer Song**

* The longer song's length is 0.60 times the length of the first song.
*  Length of the longer song = 0.60 * 5 minutes = 3 minutes

**4. Calculate the Total Duration of the Cassette**

* Total duration = length of first song + length of longer song. 
* Total duration = 5 minutes + 3 minutes = 8 minutes


{The final answer is 8 minutes} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first
So the second song was 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 minutes

If he bought 2 devices , last Monday and 4 devices ? last Tuesday, how much profit was he able to . earn . after selling all the mobile devices . he bought ? last , Monday and Tuesday?<end_of_turn>


Here's the breakdown:

**Understanding the Problem:**

* **Objective:**  Find Linus's total profit after selling the devices.
* **Details:**
    * Cost of one device: $20
    * Selling Price of one device: Twice the original cost  (2 * $20 = $40)
    * Number of devices bought: 2 on Monday + 4 on Tuesday = 6 devices

**Step-by-Step Solution**

1. **Calculate profit per device:** 
   * Selling Price - Cost Price = Profit per device
   * $40 - $20 = $20 profit per device.

2. **Calculate total profit from Monday's sales:**
   * Profit per device * Number of devices = Total profit from Monday
   * $20 * 2 = $40

3. **Calculate total profit from Tuesday's sales:**
   * Profit per device * Number of devices = Total profit from Tuesday
   * $20 * 4 = $80

4. **Calculate total profit:**
   * Total profit from Monday + Total profit from Tuesday = Total profit
   * $40 + $80 = $120



**Final Answer:** {The final answer is $120} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40
The total cost for the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80
The total cost of these devices is 80+40= <<80+40=120>>120
Linus sold each mobile device he bought for $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.
So, he earned $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 for the two devices he bought last Monday.
And he earned $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the 4 devices he bought last Tuesday.
The total amount of sales he made were worth 160+80 =<<160+80=240>>240
Linus earned 240-120 =$<<240-120=120>>120

Here's how we can solve the problem step by step.

**1. Figure out Ned's height:**

* Isabel is 7 feet tall.
* Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.

**2. Figure out Carl's height:**

* Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.

**3. Determine the cane's length:**

* Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
* Therefore, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.


{The final answer is 3 feet}  


<end_of_turn><eos>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

1. **Energy demand per person:** 
    * Each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy need.
    * We need to find out how much energy a single person needs. 

2. **Calculate the total daily energy need:** 
    * Multiply the number of people by their daily energy need.
    * For example: 2300 people * their daily energy need


3. **Determine the required number of bottles:** 
    * Divide the total daily energy need by the energy coverage per bottle. 
    * For example: 2300 people * their daily energy need / (20% of 1 person's daily energy need)


4. **Calculate the extra bottles:**
   * Subtract the current number of bottles produced from the number of bottles required.

    * Milligrams of vitamins or other nutrients 


Let me know if you have specific details about the daily energy needs for people, and I can give you a more precise calculation! <end_of_turn><eos>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.

*  **Purple wearers:** We know Carla dresses 3/4 of the octuplets in purple.  
*  **Blue wearers:**  We know 1/4 wearers are in blue.

**2. Focus on the Group Wearing Bows** 

*  **Combining the groups:** We need to find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is actually wearing purple.
*  **Identifying the relevant figures:** We now need to recognize how much of the purple-wearers are also wearing bows. 

**3. Calculate the Proportion**

* **Using probability concepts:** We can see that these ratios are linked together, allowing us to solve for the relevant proportion.

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the area of land sold initially**

* Half of the land is sold for $50, so the area of that sale is $50 / ($50 per square meter) = 1 square meter
 
**Step 2: Calculate the area of land sold second**

* Another 1/4 of the land is sold for $30. 
* So, the area of that sale is $30 / ($30 per square meter) = 1 square meter.

**Step 3: Calculate the area of the land that remains**

* He starts with 80 square meters.
* He sells half of it, meaning 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.


**Step 4: Calculate the money earned from the remaining land**

* The remaining land is 40 square meters, and each square meter sells for $3, so the money earned will be $3 * 40 = $120

**The final answer is $120**
<end_of_turn><eos>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

**Step 1: Determine the total face masks used per day.**

* Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times per outing, and he goes out 3 times a day.
*  Total face masks used per day = 2 changes/outing * 3 outings/day = 6 face masks/day

**Step 2: Determine the total face masks used over two days.**

*  We found that Tyrion uses 6 face masks per day. 
*  Over two days, the total face masks used is 6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks.


**Step 3: The final answer**
{The final answer is 12} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tyrion uses 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 face masks every day.
Therefore, the total number of face masks he uses every 2 days is 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy. ;  And ; Mei finds half , as many . as Charlie.  How ? many ; eggs ? are ! still hidden ; in the yard?<end_of_turn>


Let's break down the problem step by step:

**1.  Laying out the Information**

*   **Cole's Eggs:**  The problem states Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.  A dozen is 12, so Cole hid 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.
*   **Lamar's Find:** Lamar found 5 eggs.
*   **Stacy's Find:** Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar, so Stacy found 5 * 2 = 10 eggs.
*   **Charlie's Find:** Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie found 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
*   **Mei's Find:** Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie, so Mei found 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

**2.  Finding Total Eggs**
*  To find the total number of eggs hid, add all the eggs found: 36 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 63 eggs.


**3.  Answering the Question**


{The final answer is 63 eggs} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.
Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 eggs.
Charlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.
Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.
The children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.
The total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem:

**1.  Define Variables:**

*   Let 'x' represent the number of apartments at the first two complexes combined. 
*   The last complex has 1.60x apartments since it's 60% bigger. 
*   Let 'y' represent the number of garbage collections per week.
  * There are different collections per apartment complex

**2.  Calculate Total Apartments:** 

*   Complex 1 & 2: 200 apartments/complex * 2 complexes = 400 apartments
*   Complex 3 : 1.60x apartments

**3.  Calculate the Total Number of Apartments**
*   400 apartments + 1.60x apartments  


**4.  Calculate Earnings**
*   Earnings per week = $0.40/apartment * (Number of Apartments)

**5.  Calculate Weekly Earnings**
*   Total Earnings per week = Earnings per week * (Number of Collections/Week)

 
**Let me know if you'd like me to work out the exact numbers for each collection.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week
So he makes 3120*$0.4=$<<3120*0.4=1248>>1248 every week

Here's a breakdown of the problem and solution:

**Understanding the Problem**

* We're given the number of fruits produced by a young avocado tree based on age.
* We need to calculate the total for a 10-year lifespan. 

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Ages and Fruit Production:** 
    * We track the production of fruits for different age groups:
        * 5 years old: 50 fruits
        * 6 years old: 3 * 50 fruits = 150 fruits
        * 7 years old: 7 * 50 fruits = 350 fruits
        * 8 years old: 350 fruits - 200 fruits = 150 fruits
        * 10 years old: 20 * 50 fruits = 1000 fruits 

2. **Total Fruit Production for Each Year:**
    * We need to calculate the total number of fruits per year for each age group to determine the total over ten years.


**Final Answer:** {The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 4850} <end_of_turn><eos>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

*I would like you to show the steps of thinking through it.* 

**Here's how we can solve this:**

1. **Figure out how much Sophia gave Jack.**
   * Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100. 
   * To find out how much this is, multiply Sophia's money by 1/5. 
   * (1/5) * $100 = $20

2. **Calculate Jack's total money after receiving the gift.**
   * Jack started with $100.
   * Added the $20 from Sophia.
   *  $100 + $20 =  $120.

 **The final answer is:** $120 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Sophia gave 100 * 1/5 =<<100*1/5=20>>20 $ to Jack.

**Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:**

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the yellow rope.
* The blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 'x - 7'.
* The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so its length is 4 * (x - 7).

**2.  Set up an Equation:**

 The total combined length of all three ropes is 37 cm.  Therefore:
  x + (x - 7) + 4*(x - 7) = 37

**3. Solve the Equation:**

* Simplify the equation: 
   x + x - 7 + 4x - 28  = 37
* Combine like terms: 
   6x - 35 = 37
* Add 35 to both sides:
   6x = 72
* Divide both sides by 6:
   x = 12

**4. Find the Length of the Yellow Rope** 

* We have found out that x = 12.

**5. Find the Length of the Blue Rope**


* The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so its length is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters. 

**6. Find the Length of the Red Rope**


* The red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so it is 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters.



{The final answer is 20 centimeters}<end_of_turn><eos>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters
Blue rope = Y - 7
Red rope = 4 * (Y - 7)
Y + Y - 7 + 4 (Y - 7) = 37 cm
6Y - 35 = 37
6Y = 72
Y = <<12=12>>12 cm
The red rope was 20 cm long.

{Ronnie's money left}

**Reasoning**

1. **Rissa's initial amount:** Rissa was given thrice as much money as Ronnie, so she had $5 * 3 = $15. 

2. **Each person's gift:** After each of them giving an equal amount to their sister, they each have the same amount as they received. So, we need to figure out how much they each spent to their sisters.

3. **Rissa's final amount:** After giving an equal amount to their sister, Rissa has 4/5 of her initial amount, which means she has $15 * (4/5) = $12 left. 

4. **Ronnie's final amount:** We can now use the information above to continue.  

   


<end_of_turn><eos>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.
After Rissa had given an amount to her sister, she has $15 x 4/5 = $<<15*4/5=12>>12 left.

Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

* We have a mural with four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow.
* The amounts of each color are equal.
* Half the mural is painted yellow.
* 12 pints of paint are used in total. 
* We want to find how many pints of red paint were used.



**2. Set up Information:**
* We need to figure out the combination of each color so we can find the amount of red paint.


**3. Determine the Proportion of Colors:**

* Half the mural is painted yellow, so we know 1/2 of the mural is yellow.

**4.  Identify the Relationship**
* The red, white, and purple paint colors are equally distributed.


**5. Isolate and Work Out the Amount of Red:**

* We know 12 pints are used in total. 
*  To find the amount of red paint, we look for any clues relating to quantities of each color.

* Let 'b' represent the number of bedrooms in Tom's house.
* Let 'l' represent the area of the living room.
* Let 't' represent the total area of the house
 

**2. Set up Formulas**

* **Bedrooms' area**: Each bedroom has an area of 20 feet * 12 feet = 240 square feet.
* **Living room's area**: The living room is 5 times bigger than a bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 sq ft = 1200 sq ft.
* **Total House area**: The total house area is the sum of the bedroom area, living room area, and the remaining 1000 sq ft.


**3.  Write the Equations**

We can write the total area of the house as:

**4.  Solve for the Number of Bedrooms**

* Simplify the equation: t = 240b + 2200

**Solution**

1. **Understand the problem:** The problem asks us to calculate the number of cycles we can run with the new box at a given price. This requires finding out the number of pods per box.
2. **Calculate the number of pods in the regular box:**  We know the regular box has 100 dishwasher pods.
3. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:** The new box has 20% more pods.  We can calculate this by multiplying the pods in the regular box by 0.20: 100 pods * 0.20 = 20 extra pods  The new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.
4. **Calculate the price for one cycle with the new box:**  The price for one cycle with the new box is $1.
5. **Determine the number of cycles you can run:**  We can divide the number of pods in the new box by the number of pods needed per cycle.


{The final answer is}
<end_of_turn><eos>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10

Here's how we can approach this problem step-by-step:

**1. Goals in the First Half**

* Team A scores 4 goals.
* Team B scores 2 goals. 

**2. Goals in the Second Half:**

* Team B scores 4 times the number of goals from the first half.
* Therefore, Team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.
* Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half.
*  Team A scores (1/4) * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

The process of solving this problem requires that we use the steps below:

1. **Identify the problem:** What is the key question we need to answer?
2. **Define the variables:** What information do we know, and what information do we need to find?
3. **Apply mathematical operations:**  Determine the calculations required to solve the problem for the remaining days.
4. **Interpret the results:** Make sense of the results and answer the question. 

Let's begin!


1. **Identify the problem:**
    * The problem is: How many days can the teacher use this chunk of chalk before needing to recycle it? 
    
2. **Define the variables:**
    * **Amount of chalk used:**  This is what the teacher needs to use before he needs to recycle it. We need to calculate the percent of chalk that is used
    * **Maximum Use of chalk: **  This is 20% of the initial chalk
    
3. **Apply mathematical operations:** 
   * First, we need to find the amount of chalk used in the beginning.  
        
4. **Interpret the results:**
   * Let's figure out how many days until he needs to recycle


Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any step or give more detail.
<end_of_turn><eos>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Identify the given information:**

*   Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls.
*   One-third of the girls are on varsity. 
*   One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.


**2. Define variables:**

*   Let 'g' represent the number of girls on varsity.
*   Let 'b' represent the number of boys on varsity. 

**3. Set up equations based on the given information:**

*   Equation 1:  g = (1/3) * 12  
     We know one-third of the girls is on varsity, so this gives us g = 4
*   Equation 2: b = (1/4) * 12
     We know one-fourth of the boys is on varsity, so this gives us b = 3

**4. Determine the number of students not on varsity:**

*   Total students = boys + girls
*   Total students = 12 + 12 = 24
 
*   Students on varsity = g + b = 4 + 3 = 7

*   Students not on varsity = Total students - Varsity students
*   Students not on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17


**The final answer is 17** 

 

<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.
12 x 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 girls are on varsity.
12 x 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 boys are on varsity.
A total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 students in Miss Albert's class are on varsity.
Therefore, 24 - 7 = <<24-7=17>>17 students are not on varsity.

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of teeth capped:** The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 

2. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:** The dentist fixes 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.

3. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**  Divide the number of teeth fixed by the total number of teeth and multiply by 100%

{The final answer is}


**Solution:**
1. **Set up variables:**
   - Let Wendy's current age be 'w'
   - Let Colin's current age be 'c'

2. **Translate the first sentence into an equation:**
   - ""Wendy is five times older than Colin will be seven years from now"" translates to: w = 5(c+7) 

3. **Translate the second sentence into an equation:**
   - ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"" translates to: w + 25 = (3/1) * (c + 25)

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - We now have two equations:
      - Equation 1: w = 5(c + 7)
      - Equation 2: w + 25 = (3/1) * (c + 25)
   - Substitute the value of 'w' from Equation 1 into Equation 2: 
      - 5(c + 7) + 25 = (3/1) * (c + 25)
   - Simplify the equation:
      - 5c + 35 + 25 = 3c + 75 
   - Combine like terms: 
      - 5c + 60 = 3c + 75
   - Solve for 'c' :
      - 2c = 15
      - c = 7.5
 
5. **Find Wendy's current age:**
   - Substitute the value of 'c' into Equation1:
      - w = 5(7.5 + 7)
      - w = 5(14.5) 
      - w = 72.5


**Answer:** 
The final answer is Colin is now 7.5 years old.

*   **Step 3:** Determine the final answer.   



Let's break down the problem:

**Step 1: Identify the key information**

The problem gives us a series of actions and outcomes related to apples falling from a tree and Newton's actions. Here are the important parts:

*   **Initial:** Two apples fall from the tree.
*   **Newton's Actions:**
    *   He picks up two apples.
    *   He puts one in his pocket.
    *   He throws one at the tree, causing five more to fall.
    *   He picks up the five new apples.
    *   He puts most of them in his pocket.
    *   He throws the last one at the tree, causing six more to fall.
    *   He picks up all the apples left.

**Step 2: Construct a step-by-step chain of thought**

1. **Start:** We begin with two original apples.
2. **Throw 1:** One apple falls and more from the tree.
3. **Pick up more:** Newton picks up five new apples
4. **Continue to collect:** Newton gains more from his throws.
5. **Final Collection:** He gathers the remaining apples. 
   
**Step 3: Determine the final answer**

We need to determine how many apples Newton brought home. The problem does not provide the exact number of apples thrown, he picks up new apples.

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**1. Find the sister's slices:**

* Doxa's sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa.
* Doxa ate 1 slice, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.

**2. Find the brother's slices:**

* Doxa's brother ate 1 more slice than her sister. 
* Her sister ate 2 slices, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.

**3. Calculate the total slices:**

* Doxa ate 1 slice
* Sister ate 2 slices
* Brother ate 3 slices

 The total slices they ate: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.



{The final answer is 6}<end_of_turn><eos>","Her sister ate 1 + 1 = <<1+1=2>>2 slices.
Her brother ate 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices.
They ate a total of 1 + 2 + 3 = <<1+2+3=6>>6 slices.

<eos>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.

Suppose Jen did : not incur any : absences for  . April, and there are exactly 4 weeks in April, how ? much will she receive?<end_of_turn>


**Solution**
Here's the breakdown of the problem and how to reach the solution:

1. **Find Jen's daily earnings:**
   -  Hourly rate: $1.50
   -  Working hours: 7.5 hours
   -  Daily earnings: $1.50 * 7.5 = $11.25

2. **Find Jen's weekly earnings:**
   -  Daily earnings: $11.25
   -  Weeks worked: 6 days
   -  Weekly earnings: $11.25 * 6 = $67.50

3. **Calculate any additional earning:**
   -  Additional payment for complete attendance: $10
   -  Weekly earnings: $67.50
   -  Total weekly earnings with attendance bonus: $67.50 + $10 = $77.50 

4. **Determine the total earnings for April:**
   -  Weeks in April: 4 weeks
   -  Weekly earnings: $77.50 
   -  Total earnings for April: $77.50 * 4 = $310.00

 {The final answer is $310.00}




<end_of_turn><eos>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

{The final answer is}

**Solution:**
1. **Find the number of black pens.**

2. **Find the total number of red pens.**
    * Alain has 5 packs of red pens, so he has 5 packs * 5 pens/pack = 25 pens.

3. **Find the total number of black pens.**
   *  He also has 10 packs of black pens, so he has 10 packs * 5 pens/pack = 50 pens.

   * Alain has 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. 



**Final answer is 75 pens**<end_of_turn><eos>","Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1.  Determine the cost of one bottle of scotch.**

*  We know John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600 total. 
*  Cost per bottle of scotch = $600 / 10 bottles = $60 per bottle.

**2. Calculate the cost of one bottle of cognac.**

*  Cognac cost 50% more than scotch.
*  50% of $60 = (1/2) * $60 = $30 more per bottle of cognac.
*  Cost of one bottle of cognac = $60 + $30 = $90

**3.  Calculate the number of bottles of cognac.**

*  We know John buys twice as many bottles of cognac.
*  Number of bottles of cognac = 10 bottles * 2 = 20 bottles.

**4.  Calculate the total cost of the cognac.**

*  Total cost of cognac = 20 bottles * $90 per bottle = $1800.

**5. Calculate the total cost of both products.**

*  Total cost = cost of scotch + cost of cognac
*  Total cost = $600 + $1800 = $2400

**{The final answer is $2400.}** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each
He bought 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac
Each bottle cost .5*60=$<<.5*60=30>>30 more than the scotch
So they cost $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90
That means he spent $90*20=$<<90*20=1800>>1800 on the cognac
So he spent a total of $600+$1800=$<<600+1800=2400>>2400

Here's a breakdown of how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Lodgepole Pine on Day 1**

* Mr. Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees.
* He planted 20 White Oak trees * 2 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 1. 

**Step 2: White Oak on Day 2**

* He planted 10 more White Oak trees on Day 2.
* Total White Oak trees planted: 20 (Day 1) + 10 (Day 2) = 30 trees

**Step 3: Lodgepole Pine on Day 2**

* He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees on Day 2.
* Total Lodgepole Pine trees planted on Day 2: 40 (Day 1) + (1/4) * 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 trees


**Step 4: Total Trees Planted**

*  Total trees planted on Day 1: 20 White Oak + 40 Lodgepole Pine = 60 trees 
* Total trees planted on Day 2: 30 White Oak + 50 Lodgepole Pine = 80 trees

* **The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:** 60 + 80 = {140 trees}



<end_of_turn><eos>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
On the second day, he increased the number of White Oak trees planted to 20 trees + 10 trees = <<20+10=30>>30 trees.
At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees

* The question is a bit convoluted, but we can break it down step-by-step.


**Step 1: Start with the initial amount of root beer**

Fred started with 24 gallons.

**Step 2: Account for the children's robbery**

* The children drank 4 gallons.
* 24 - 4 = 20 gallons remained.

**Step 3: Account for Barbie's spill**

* Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
* 20 - 7 = 13 gallons remained.

**Step 4: Account for Ronnie's help himself**

* Ronnie took 5 gallons.
* 13 - 5 = 8 gallons remained.

**Step 5:  Determine the amount available for the party**

* 8 gallons remained.
* The question asks how much was available for each person to drink.


**Final answer is:** 8 gallons. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.

On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Define the variables:**

*  Let `c` represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

**2. Translate the given information into equations:**

* We are told ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs""  
   This translates to the equation:  `c + 8 = 4c`

* We are told ""in the teacher’s lounge is 40""
   This translates to the equation: `c + 8 = 40` 

  

**3. Solve the equations:**

* **Step 1:** Solve for `c` in the equation `c + 8 = 4c`
   Subtract `c` from both sides: `8 = 3c`
   Divide both sides by `3`: `c = 8/3`

* **Step 2:** We need a decimal form for `c`.
  

**4. Calculate the answer:**

 * The number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is  `c = 8/3` 
   {The final answer is **2.67** coffee mugs}

                    Amy had ! two eyeshadow palettes with four colors ; each ? and : three : makeup sets that came ; with six . eyeshadow colors each. ? Her sister , steals one : of the palettes. Amy uses up half of ! the colors from one makeup set. How many eyeshadow , colors ? does . she have left?<end_of_turn>
*The problem is a bit unclear.*
  
Here's a breakdown of how we can approach the problem and how to solve it:


**Step 1: Determine the total number of eyeshadow colors initially.**

* Amy had two palettes with 4 colors each, so she has 2 * 4 = 8 eyeshadow colors.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of eyeshadow colors in the makeup set.**

* Each makeup set has 6 eyeshadow colors.
*  Amy had 2 palettes * 8 colors =  16 eyeshadow colors initially


**Step 3: Determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy uses.**

* Amy uses half of one makeup set's 6 colours = 6 / 2 = 3 eyeshadow colors

**Step 4: Determine the number of eyeshadow colors left.**

*  Amy started with 16 colors and used 3 colors, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eyeshadow colors left.



{The final answer is 13 } 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.
Her sister stole one palette of 4 colors, leaving Amy with 26 - 4 = <<26-4=22>>22 colors.
Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.
Thus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.

**Solution:**

1. **Find the height of the first floor:**
   - Mattison's height is 60 inches.
   - The first floor's ceiling is three times his height. 
   - First floor ceiling height = 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches. 

2. **Find the height of the second floor:**
   - The second floor is 7 times taller than Mattison.
   - Second floor height = Mattison's height * 7 = 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches.
  
3. **Determine the height of the roof:**
   - The roof sits on the second floor,
   - The roof height is equal to the second floor height minus the first floor ceiling height. 
   - Roof height = Second floor height - First floor ceiling height = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches.

 
{The final answer is 240 inches} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas:**

*  40% of 700 shells is (40/100) * 700 = 280 shells.

**2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas found their share:**

*  700 shells - 280 shells = 420 shells.

**3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders:**

* 60% of 420 shells is (60/100) * 420 = 252 shells.   

**4. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters:**

*  To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, subtract the shells found by the other two teams from the total number of shells: 700 shells - 280 shells - 252 shells = 168 shells. 


{The final answer is 168 shells.} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.

Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.

Here's how we can solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out the amount of the second medicine per dose.**

* The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first.
* So, the second medicine for one dose is 14 mL * 3 = 42 mL.

**2. Calculate the total volume of each dose.**

*   The total volume for one dose is the combination of the first and second medicine.
*   The total volume of one dose is 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

**3. Determine the volume of medicine in 8 doses.**

* We need the volume for 8 doses.
* So, the final answer is 56 mL/dose * 8 doses = {448 mL}

He : estimates : 30% , of the ! jelly beans are red. ,  The ; true ; number . of red jelly ! beans in the container is 900.  . How : far off was his ? guess?<end_of_turn>


**Here's the breakdown of the steps:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Tim needs to estimate the number of red jelly beans.
   - The jar's dimensions are important to calculate the volume.
   - The efficiency of packing affects the final number of beans.
   - He has a given red jelly bean count to compare against.

2. **Calculate the Volume of the Jar:**
    - The jar has a square base, so the volume is calculated as: 
    - Volume = Base area * Height
    - Base area = side * side = 6 inches * 6 inches 
    - Volume = 36 cubic inches * 15 inches = 540 cubic inches

3. **Calculate the Packed Volume of the Jar:**
    - The efficiency is 80%
    - Packed volume = Actual volume * Efficiency 
    - Packed volume = 540 cubic inches * 0.80 = 432 cubic inches

4. **Determine the Capacity of Red Jelly Beans:**
    - Tim estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.
    - Red jelly bean capacity = Packed volume * Estimated red bean percentage
    - Red jelly bean capacity = 432 cubic inches * 0.30 = 129.6 cubic inches

5. **Calculate the Number of Red Jelly Beans with Given Precision:**
    - The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
 

6. **Determine the Difference Between his Estimate and the Actual:**
    - Difference = (True jelly beans - Estimate)
    - Difference = 900 - (129.6 cubic inches) = 770.4 



**{The final answer is 770.4}** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

**Solution:**

1. **Step 1: Calculate the number of passengers who entered at the second stop.**
   - 3/4 of the passengers at the first stop: 40 people * (3/4) = 30 people 

2. **Step 2: Calculate the total number of passengers after the first two stops.**
   - Total passengers: 20 people + 40 people + 30 people = 90 people

3. **Step 3: Calculate the number of passengers needed at the third stop.**
    - The number of passengers double: 90 people * 2 = 180 people

4. **Step 4: Calculate the number of passengers needed at the last stop.**
    - Total passengers needed: 180 people

**Final Answer is: 180 {}**




<end_of_turn><eos>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.

How much did . Pauline spend : on all visits to the museum?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how to break down the problem:**

**1. Cost increase:**
   * The cost of one visit has increased by 150%. 
  *  This means the new price will be 150% of the old price.
       
**2.  Calculate the new price:**

   *  Since the new price is 150% of the old price, we need to figure out the old price to do the calculation. 
       
**3. Calculate the number of visits over 5 years**

* Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
*  Over 5 years: 3 visits/year * 5 years = 15 visits

**4. Calculate the total cost**

* Total Cost = (Cost per visit) * (Number of visits) 
* Total Cost = $2/visit * 15 visits = $30 
  


{The final answer is $30} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

Here's a breakdown of how to solve the problem step by step:

**1. Calculate the cost of the tables:**
   * Cost per table: $20
   * Number of tables: 4
   * Total cost of tables: $20 * 4 = $80

**2. Calculate the cost of the roof frames:**
   * Cost per frame: $10
   * Number of frames: 2
   * Total cost of frames: $10 * 2 = $20

**3. Calculate the total cost:**
   * Total cost of tables + total cost of frames = total cost for Ali 
   * $80 + $20 = $100 {The cost of the tables plus the cost of the frames}



**Final Answer:** Ali has to pay $100. 
<end_of_turn><eos>","For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the length of the shorter piece.
* Let '4x' represent the length of the longer piece.

**2. Set Up an Equation:**

* The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece.  So, we can write the equation:  4x = longer piece

**3. Solve for x:**

*  We know the longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, meaning longer piece is 4x.
* We also know that the longer piece is 40 feet long. 
* Let's equal the two for the length : 4x = 40


**4. Isolate x:**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 10


**5. Find the length of the longer piece:**

* Substitute the value of 'x' into the longer piece equation: 4x = 4 * 10 
* Therefore: 4x = 40 


**6. The answer:**
The longer piece is 40 feet long. 



{The final answer is 40 feet}<end_of_turn><eos>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.
Adding like terms makes the equation 5x = 40.
Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

**1. Determine the number of pounds of meat:**

* He gets 80 meatballs from 16 meatballs per pound of beef. 
*  This means he needs 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound = 5 pounds of beef.

**2. Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**

* He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of beef. 
*  Therefore, he needs 5 pounds * 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

{The final answer is 10 tablespoons.}

Here's how we can break down this problem:

**Step 1: Calculate the total width of all the windows.**

*  Width of one window: 35 inches
* Number of windows: 5
* Total width: 35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

**Step 2: Determine the amount of fabric Luke needs.**

*  Luke needs fabric twice the total window width: 175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

**Step 3: Convert the result to the appropriate measurement unit (e.g., feet, yards).**

* 1 inch = 1/12 foot

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the initial rate period.**
    * We know the initial call price is $0.25 per minute for the first 16 minutes. 
    * To find the cost at this rate, multiply the price per minute by the number of minutes. 
    * Cost = $0.25/minute * 16 minutes = $4.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the discounted rate period.**
   *  The call rate changes to $0.2 per minute for the remaining call time (36 - 16 = 20 minutes). 
   *   Cost = $0.2/minute * 20 minutes = $4.

**Step 3: Add the costs of both periods.**
   *  Add the cost at the first rate and the cost at the new rate. 
   *  Total cost = $4 + $4  = $8. 


**The final answer is: $8** . 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.
After that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.
So in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.

{The final answer is}

Here's how we can tackle this problem:

**1. Set up variables:**

* Let 'x' represent the amount of rain on Monday.

**2. Define the rain for Tuesday:**

*  Twice of Monday's rain:  2 * x
*  One inch more than twice of Monday's rain: 2x + 1

**3.  Express the rain on Tuesday:**

* Total rain on Tuesday: 2x + 1

**4.  Combine the rain totals:**

* Total rain on Monday + total rain on Tuesday: x + (2x + 1)


**5. Solve for x:**

* x + (2x + 1) = 2 

**6. Simplify the equation:**

* 3x + 1 = 2


**7. Isolate x:**

* Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: 
   3x = 1

**8.  Solve for x:**

* Divide both sides of the equation by 3: 
   x = 1/3


**9. Find the rain on Tuesday:**

* Substitute the value of x into the equation for Tuesday's rain:
  2 * (1/3) + 1

**10. Simplify**
  2/3 + 1

**11. Calculate the final answer**
   2/3 + 1 = 5/3

 


You should always check your work by making sure the units of measure are consistent and accurate in the expression

*The question has multiple parts that need to be answered by a calculation and clear reasoning.*

**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Define variables:**
   * Let `c` be the number of cupcakes Carly made.
   * Let `b` be the number of brownies Carly made.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   * ""She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes""  translates to the equation: `b = 3c - 2`
   * ""If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats"" translates to the equation: `b + c = 10` (The total number of treats = number of brownies + number of cupcakes)

3. **Solve for `c` (the number of cupcakes):**
   * **Substitute** the first equation (`b = 3c - 2`) into the second equation: `(3c - 2) + c = 10`
   * **Combine like terms**: `4c - 2 = 10` 
   * **Add 2 to both sides**: `4c = 12` 
   * **Divide both sides by 4**: `c = 3`

4. **Answer:**
  * Carly made `3` cupcakes. 


{The final answer is 3} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

To solve this problem, we'll break it down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the price increase in December.**

* The price increased by 80% of $40.
* 80/100 * $40 = $32

**Step 2: Calculate the new price after the December increase.**

* The new price after the December increase is $40 + $32 = $72.

**Step 3: Calculate the price decrease in January.**

* The price decreased by 50% of $72.
* 50/100 * $72 = $36

**Step 4: Calculate the price after the January discount.**

* The price after the January discount is $72 - $36 = $36. 


{The final answer is $36} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.
The 80% increment represents 40*0.8=$32
In December, the toy's price was 40 + 32 = $<<40+32=72>>72.
The 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36
In January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.

Here's the breakdown of the solution:

**1. Calculate the standard fee for the 4 lessons:**

* Standard rate per hour = $80
* Number of hours = 4 hours
* Standard fee = $80/hour * 4 hours = $320 

**2. Calculate the reduced rate for the 2 veteran lessons:**

* Reduced rate = 25% of $80 = $20
* Reduced rate = $80 * 0.25 = $20 

**3. Calculate the fee for the 2 veteran lessons:**

* Reduced fee per hour = $80 - $20 = $60

 **4. Calculate the total fee for all the lessons:**

* Standard fee + Reduced fee = $320 + $20 = $340

 {The final answer is $340} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
Reducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.
Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:** 
   - Let 'x' represent the number of pomelos Eve gave away.

2. **Set up an equation:**
   -  Eve starts with 20 pomelos and is left with 1/4 of that:
     20 - x = (1/4) * 20

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - 20 - x = 5

4. **Solve for x:** 
   - Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
     -x = -15
   - Multiply both sides by -1:
     x = 15.  

 
**The final answer is 15 pomelos.**

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

**1.  Determine the number of apples Walter ate:**

*   Start by figuring out the fraction of apples Walter ate. This is 2/5 of the initial amount.
*   The calculation is (2/5) * 60 = 24 apples
 

**2.  Calculate the remaining number of apples:**

*   Subtract the number he ate from the initial purchase: 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

**3. Calculate the number of apples given to his sister:**

*   Calculate 25% of the remaining apples : 36 * (25/100) = 9 apples.

**4. Calculate the number of apples remaining after giving to his sister:**

*   Subtraction from the number in step 2: 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

**5. Determine the amount Walter received from selling the remaining apples:**

*   Calculate the number of apples sold at $3 each: 27 * $3 = $81. 


 
**6. The final answer is:**  $81 

<end_of_turn><eos>","From the 60 apples that Walter bought, he ate 2/5*60=<<2/5*60=24>>24 apples
The number of apples remaining was 60-24=<<60-24=36>>36
Walter gave 25/100*36=<<25/100*36=9>>9 apples to his sister.
He remained with 36-9=<<36-9=27>>27 apples.
He then sold the apples for 27*$3=$<<27*3=81>>81 to his uncle.

                    Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number : of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?<end_of_turn>


**Solution:**

1. **Understand the relationship:** Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that represents 3/4 of the novels she's written this year.

2. **Set up a proportion:**
   * Let  'x' be the number of novels Regina has written this year. 
   * The sentence is expressed as a proportion: (9 novels) / (3/4 novels) = x 
   
3. **Simplify the proportion:**
   *  To solve for 'x', we need to turn the fraction into a decimal. Then, we can solve for 'x': 
   * (9 novels) / (0.75 novels) = x
   
4. **Solve for 'x':**
   * Multiply both sides of the equation by (0.75 novels). 

5. **Find the value of 'x':**
        * (9 novels) * (0.75 novels) = x

6. **Calculate the value of 'x':**
        * x = 6.75 novels

7. **Final answer**:
        *The final answer is 6.75 novels


<end_of_turn><eos>","Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
Multiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels

*The question asks for the percentage of the travel distance covered by Michael.*

Here's how we can solve this:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in 3 days.**

* Michael travels at 50km/hr.
* We need to consider that the speed is constant and there are no stops.
* The total distance travelled in 3 days is 3 days * 50 km/hr = 150 km

**Step 2: Find the percentage of the distance traveled. **

* Divide the distance traveled by the total distance.
* 150 km / 6000 km = 0.025 
 
**Step 3: Convert the decimal to a percentage.**

* Multiply the decimal portion (0.025) by 100.
* 0.025 * 100 = 2.5%


**The final answer is:** 2.5% 


<end_of_turn><eos>","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the key information:** 
    * Madeline started with 6 grapes.
    * Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
    * Madeline wanted to make a full glass. 
    * Their mother then used the remaining grapes for 4 pies. 
    * The pie recipe needs 12 grapes per pie. 

2. **Calculate the number of grapes used by Madeline's brother:**
    * Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

3. **Calculate the total grapes used by both Madeline and her brother:**
    * Together they used 30 grapes (brother) + 6 grapes (Madeline) = 36 grapes.

4. **Determine the remaining grapes**: 
    *  We know that the total grapes used was 36 and Madeline's mother had 4 pies, so Madeline's mother used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

1. **Identify the given information:**
    * Last Friday, 13 out of 82 teachers were sick.
    * 9 substitute teachers were called in.

2. **Define the unknown:**
    * We want to find the total number of teachers at school that day.

3. **Use the given information to form an equation:**
    *  We can use the information that ""Last Friday, 13 out of 82 teachers were sick"" to represent the unknown:  Total teachers -13 = teachers sick
    
4. **Substitute the known values to solve for the unknown:**
    * To find the total number of teachers (Total teachers), we need to isolate it in the equation from Step 3.
    * Total teachers = ...
    * Total teachers -13 = teachers sick
    * Total teachers = teachers sick + 13
    * Total teachers = 13

5. **Use the information about substitute teachers:**
    * We know there were 9 substitute teachers called in.
  
6. ** Find the total teachers:**
   * We used the information about 'teachers sick' to find the number of total teachers
   * Total teachers = 13

How much money does , Bud spend on , making macaroni ? and cheese in one year?<end_of_turn>


Here's how we can solve this problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of Gruyere cheese per box:**

* Bud spends twice the amount for Gruyere as he does for cheddar.
* Cost of Gruyere = 2 * $3.00 = $6.00

**2. Calculate the total cost per box of macaroni and cheese:**

* Cost of pasta = $1.00
* Cost of cheddar cheese = $3.00
* Cost of Gruyere cheese = $6.00
* Total cost per box = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

**3. Calculate the number of boxes of macaroni and cheese Bud makes in a year:**

* Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. 
* There are 52 weeks in a year.
* Number of boxes = 52 weeks * 1 box/week = 52 boxes

**.4. Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per year:**

* Total cost per box = $10.00
* Number of boxes = 52
*Total cost per year = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

 {The final answer is $520.00} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

3. **Determine the daily workday:**
   * Workday duration: 8 hours

4. **Calculate the daily cleaning time in proportion to the workday:**
   * Daily cleaning time: 20 hours
   * Workday duration: 8 hours
   * Proportion of cleaning time as a percentage of a workday: 20 / 8 * 100% = 250%

5. **Adjust the percentage:**

*  Therefore, the total cost of the eggs is 60 * $2.40 = $144. 

**2. Calculate the number of egg sales:**

*   Rose sells each egg for $1 for 3 eggs. 
*  Therefore, a total of 60 / 3 = 20  egg sales can be made.
 
**3. Calculate the total revenue from egg sales:**

*   Each egg sale brings in $1.
*   Rose will make 20 sales at $1 per egg.
*   The total revenue from egg sales is 20 * $1 = $20.  

**4. Calculate the profit:**

*   Rose's profit is the difference between her total revenue and total cost.
*   Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost 
*   Profit = $20 - $144 = -$124


**The final answer is -$124.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

Here's how we can break down the problem and solve it step by step:

**1.  Understand the given information:**

* **Cost of a bag:** $18.00
* **Discount:** $3.00 
* **Number of sticks:** 30 sticks per bag
* **Goal:** Find the cost of each stick in cents.


**2. Calculate the price of the bag after the discount:**

*  Discount amount: $3.00
*  Price after discount: $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

**3.  Find the price of each stick:**

*  Price of a bag: $15.00
*  Number of sticks: 30 
*  Cost per stick: $15.00 / 30 sticks = $0.50

**4.  Convert dollars to cents:**

*  Cost per stick in dollars: $0.50
*  1 dollar = 100 cents
*  Cost per stick in cents: $0.50 * 100 cents = 50 cents


**The final answer is: 50 cents** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00
The bag has 30 sticks of jerky and costs $15.00 so each stick will cost 15/30 = $0.50

She makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of ? blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry ? cubes minus 4. If she makes 116 ice cubes , total, how many blueberry cubes does she make?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let  's' represent the number of strawberry cubes. 

**2. Set Up an Equation**

* The problem tells us that Mary makes 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4 blueberry cubes. 
* The total number of ice cubes is 116.
* So the equation would be:  s + 5s - 4 = 116 

 
**3. Solve the Equation for 's'**

* Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116
* Add 4 to both sides of the equation: 6s = 120
* Divide both sides by 6: s = 20

**4. Find the Number of Blueberry Cubes**

* Substitute the value of 's' (20) into the equation: 20 + 5(20) - 4 = 116
* Simplify: 20 + 100 - 4 = 116
* Continue simplifying: 116 = 116
 


**5. Answer the Question**

*  The final answer is {There are 20 strawberry cubes.} 


 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

Let's break down this problem step-by-step, using clear and consistent language:

**1. Define the Goal:**

* Jason needs to make 15 car sales this month to earn a big bonus.

**2. Determine Conversion Rates:** 

* Jason finds that, on average, for every 25 calls, he gets one customer to visit the dealership. 
* He finds that, for every 2 customers he brings to the dealership, one will buy a car.

**3.  Set Up Variables:**

*  Let 'C' be the number of calls Jason needs to make to get 15 car sales. 

**4. Define the Relationship between Calls and Sales**

*  Use the relationship between calls, and customers visiting the dealership who become buyers. 

**5. Solve for 'C':**

* To achieve a sales target of 15 cars, we need to establish an effective equation that maps the number of calls to the number of customers.

Here's a step-by-step solution explanation:
 
 **1. Understand the Problem:**

   - We are given that Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets.
   - We're told that there were 20 helmets.
   - We need to find the total number of items he saw.

**2. Calculate the Number of Robots:**

   - Half the number of helmets is equal to (20 helmets) / 2 = 10 robots.

**3. Calculate the Total Number of Items:**

   -  We know there are 20 helmets.
   -  There are 10 robots.
   -  There are 20 footballs.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the key information:**
    *  Old varnish drying time: 7 minutes per painting.
    *  New varnish drying time: 12 minutes per painting.
    *  Number of paintings: 6.
    
2. **Calculate the drying time difference:** 
    *  Difference in drying time =  12 minutes - 7 minutes = 5 minutes.

3. **Extend the drying time to all the paintings:** 
    * Since the new varnish takes 5 minutes longer to dry compared to the old varnish, applying varnish to 6 paintings will now take 5 minutes * 6 = 30 minutes extra. 

4. **Determine the total time for all paintings:** 
    *  Time for all paintings with old varnish = 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.
    *  Time for all paintings with new varnish = 30 minutes extra.

5. **Calculate the difference:**
   *  Time difference = 42 minutes (old varnish) - 30 minutes (new varnish) = 12 minutes

                    Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need ; half ? of a cup : of water. . 8 plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}


Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the plants needing half a cup:**
   - 4 plants * (1/2) cup / plant = 2 cups of water

2. **Calculate the plants needing 1 cup:**
   - 8 plants * 1 cup / plant = 8 cups of water

3. **Calculate the plants needing a quarter of a cup:**
   - 20 plants - 4 plants - 8 plants = 8 plants

4. **Calculate how much water those needing a quarter cup need:**
   - 8 plants * (1/4) cup / plant = 2 cups of water

**Step 5: Add the amounts of water needed from each group:**
   - 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups of water


{The final answer is} 12 cups of water 


<end_of_turn><eos>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups
She will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.
Since she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

**Solution:**
1. **Identify the distances:**
   - Land distance: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
   - Water distance: 200 yards / 2 = 100 yards
2. **Calculate land time:**
   - Speed: 20 yards/minute
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time (land) = 100 yards / 20 yards/minute = 5 minutes.
3. **Calculate water time:**
   - Speed: 10 yards/minute
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Time (water) = 100 yards / 10 yards/minute = 10 minutes.
4. **Total time:**
   - Total time = Time (Land) + Time (Water)
   - Total time = 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.


{The final Answer is 15 minutes.} 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.
100 yards at 20 yards per minute is 100/20=<<100/20=5>>5 minutes.
100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.
In total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.

**Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:**

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   * Divide the total number of popsicle sticks needed by the number per box: 56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle sticks/box = 7 boxes

2. **Calculate the total cost:** 
   * Multiply the number of boxes needed by the cost per box: 7 boxes * $2.00/box = $14.00

**Final answer: It will cost Bob $14.00 to build his Washington Monument.{The final answer is}** 
 


<end_of_turn><eos>","He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes

Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, how much does the : whole phone plan cost?<end_of_turn>


**Step 1:** Define the unknowns.

* Let **x** represent the cost of each additional phone.

**Step 2:** Formulate an equation.

*  The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, meaning the main phone cost is 2x.
*  The total cost of the plan is $20.
* We can express this as an equation: 2x + 5x = $20

**Step 3:** Solve for x.

* Combine the terms on the left side: 7x = $20
* Divide both sides by 7: x = $20 / 7 = $2.86 (rounded to the nearest cent)

**Step 4:**  Calculate the cost of the main phone.

* The main phone costs 2x, so the main phone cost is 2 * $2.86 = $5.72. 

**Step 5:** Find the total cost of the whole plan.

*  The total cost of the plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the cost of all the additional phones.
* Find the total cost by adding the cost of the main phone ($5.72) and the cost of each additional phone ($2.86) for five phones: $5.72 + 5 * $2.86 = $5.72 + $14.30 = $20.02.
 


{The final answer is $20.02} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.
Thus, the four additional phones cost 4 * 10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 in all.
Thus, the whole phone plan cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60.

**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts:** 
    * Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts / day.
    * 10 dozen = 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day
2. **Calculate the daily earnings:**
    * He sells each doughnut for $2.
    * He sells 120 doughnuts per day, so his daily earnings are 120 * $2 = $240 
3. **Calculate the earnings for the entire month of June:** 
    * Assuming June has 30 days.  
    * His total earnings for June would be $240/day * 30 days = $7,200


{The final answer is $7,200} 



<end_of_turn><eos>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.
Since each doughnut sells at $2 per piece, Derrick makes 120*$2 = $<<120*2=240>>240 per day from selling his doughnuts.
In June, with 30 days, after making and selling the doughnuts every day, Derrick makes $240*30 = $<<30*240=7200>>7200

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Focus on the Key Information** 

* Jade took 210 photos.
* She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
* She uploads 6 batches per day.


**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Photos Uploaded Daily**

* She uploads 7 photos per batch.
* She uploads 6 batches per day.
* Total photos uploaded daily: 7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Days Needed**

* Total photos to upload: 210 photos
* Photos uploaded per day: 42 photos/day
* Number of days to upload all photos: 210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days.

 


**The final answer is:** 5 days.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Initial Popping Rate:**

* Garrett starts with a certain rate of kernels popping at the beginning. We don't know the starting rate, but this information is essential for the next calculations.

**2. Increased Rate:**

* After the first 30 seconds, the rate increases: ""Twenty pop in the first 30 seconds.."" 
* We need to figure out how many kernels popped in the first 30 seconds and then increase that number by three times.

**3. Sustained Increased Rate:**

* The rate speeds up further: ""four times the initial popping rate in the next thirty seconds"".
* This is where we can quantify the rate of increase

**4. Slowed Down Rate:**
* The popping rate declines after the next 30 seconds: ""the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds.""

**5. Residual Heat:**

* The kernels that stop popping after 30 seconds continue to pop slightly after the heat is removed.
* We need to figure out the number of kernels that pop from residual heat.

**6. Calculating Popcorn Count:**

* Now that we have a detailed timeline for popcorn popping, we need to establish a logical way to calculate the final amounts. 

**7. Additional Questions**



Let me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these steps or if you want to break down any specific parts further.
<end_of_turn><eos>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

Here's the solution step-by-step:

**1.  Find the total juice needed**

* Tim needs 4 gallons of lemonade.
* Each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
* Total juice needed: 4 gallons * 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups of lemon juice

**2. Calculate the number of lemons for the standard gallons**

* Each cup needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
* Tim needs 4 cups of lemon juice.
* Number of lemons: 4 cups / 1 cup/lemon = 4 lemons

**3. Determine the lemons needed for the extra gallon**

* The extra gallon is twice as tart as the others.
* He will need 4 cups of lemon juice * 2 = 8 cups of lemon juice


**4. Calculate the number of lemons for the extra gallon**
* Each cup of lemon juice needs 1 cup of lemon juice.
* Tim needs 8 cups of lemon juice.
* Number of lemons: 8 cups / 1 cup/lemon = 8 lemons 


 **5. Calculate the total number of lemons**

* He needs 4 lemons for the standard recipe
* He needs 8 lemons for the extra recipe 
* Total lemons: 4 lemons + 8 lemons = 12 lemons.



{The final answer is 12 lemons} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

*Note: You can assume they are consuming the same amount of dog food every day*

Here's how we can solve this step-by-step:

**Step 1:  Calculate the daily food consumption for each dog**

* **German Shepherd:** 5 kg/day
* **Bulldog:** 3 kg/day

**Step 2: Calculate the total daily food consumption**

* Total consumption = German Shepherd food + Bulldog food 
* Total consumption = 5 kg + 3 kg = 8 kg/day

**Step 3: Calculate the total weekly food consumption**

* Total consumption per week = Total daily consumption per day * Number of days in a week
* Total consumption per week = 8 kg/day * 7 days/week = 56 kg/week


**The final answer is:** 56 kilograms of dog food will they need in a week. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.

* Total legs from 2-legged animals + total legs from 4-legged animals = 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs


**4.  Find the number of pairs of animal legs.**

*  There are 80 legs in total.
*   Each pair of legs has 2 legs.
*  Number of pairs = 80 legs / 2 legs/pair = 40 pairs

 {The final answer is 40 pairs}


<end_of_turn><eos>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs

{The final answer is}


**Solution:**
1. **Define variables:** 
   - Let 'b' represent the number of blue blocks.
   - Let 'y' represent the number of yellow blocks.
   - Let 'r' represent the number of red blocks

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - We know the total number of blocks is 32.  So  'b + y + r = 32' 
   -  We know there are 4 blue blocks. So 'b = 4'
   - We know there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So 'y = 2b'

3. **Solve for the number of red blocks:**
   - Substitute the value of 'b' into the equation for 'y': 'y = 2(4)'
   - Simplify: 'y = 8'
   - Substitute the values of 'b' and 'y' into the equation: '4 + 8 + r = 32'
 4. **Simplify and solve for 'r':**
   - Combine the constants: '12 + r = 32' 
   -  Isolate the 'r' term: 'r = 32 - 12'
   -  Simplify: 'r = 20'


{The final answer is} 20 red blocks

Here's the breakdown of how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Define Variables**

* Let 'x' be the distance from Elvis's house to where he traveled east.

**Step 2: Analyze the Movements**

* **Westward Trip:**  He travels for 5 hours at 18 mph.
* **Eastward Trip:** He travels for 8 hours at 18 mph.

**Step 3: Use the Concepts of Distance, Time, and Speed**

* **Westward Distance:** Using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
* **Eastward Distance:**  Using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time

**Step 4: Apply the Formulas**

* **Westward Distance:**  x = 18 mph * 5 hours
* **Eastward Distance:**  
   * We must remember he traveled this distance east before turning around, so we can apply the same formula.


**Step 5: Combine the Distances**

* The total distance traveled is the sum of the westward and eastward distances. 


**Step 6: Find the Final Answer**

Here's how we can break down the solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the depreciation in the first year.**

* 30% of $9000 = (30/100) * $9000 = $2700

**Step 2: Calculate the boat's value after the first year.**

*  Original value - depreciation  = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

**Step 3: Calculate the depreciation in the second year.**

* 30% of $6300 = (30/100) * $6300 = $1890

**Step 4: Calculate the boat's value after the second year.**

*  $6300 - $1890 = $4410

**Step 5: Calculate the depreciation in the third year.**

* 20% of $4410 = (20/100) * $4410 = $882

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of each bus trip:**

*  The bus ride cost 10% of the hotel price, so each bus trip was $80 * 0.10 = $8.

**2. Calculate the total cost of the bus trips:** 

*  We know Helen rode the bus 7 times.
*  The total cost of bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56

**3. Calculate the total cost of the hotel:**

*  The hotel cost $80 per night.
*  Total hotel cost is $80 * 3 = $240

**4. Calculate the total cost of the trip:**

*  Total cost is the sum of the hotel and the bus expenses. 
*  Total cost  = $240 + $56 = $296




{The final answer is $296}<end_of_turn><eos>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.

**Here's how to break down the problem:**

1. **Identify the knowns:**
    *  Mass of the car: 1200 pounds
    *  Luggage weight: 250 pounds
    *  Weight of each child: 75 pounds * 2 = 150 pounds  
  
2. **Calculate the total weight:**
    * Total weight = 1200 lb + 250 lb + 150 lb = 1600 pounds

3. **Determine the force needed to move the car:**
    * Force = 1% of the total weight

Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the backyard:**
   - Long side: 20 feet
   - Short side: 15 feet

2. **Determine the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter is the total length of all sides of the rectangle.
   - Perimeter = 2 * (long side + short side)
   - Perimeter = 2 * (20 feet + 15 feet)
   - Perimeter = 2 * 35 feet

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - Perimeter = 70 feet

4. **Answer:**
   - James needs 70 feet of crepe paper. 



{The final answer is 70 feet}<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet

Here's the step-by-step solution:

**1. Define Variables:**

* Let 'm' represent Mia's current age.
* Let 'e' represent Emma's current age.

**2. Set up Equations:**

* We know Mia is 40 years old.  So:  m = 40
* We know they are 16 years apart in age.  This means: e - m = 16

**3. Solve for the Other Age:**

* We can use the second equation to solve for Emma's age.
* Equation: e - m = 16
* Substitute m = 40: e - 40 = 16
* Solve for e: e = 40 + 16
* Therefore: e = 56


**4. Calculate the Average Age:**

* The average age of Mia and Emma is the sum of their ages divided by 2.
* Average Age = (m + e ) /2 
* Average Age = (40 + 56) / 2
* Average Age = 96 / 2
* The average age is 48.

{The final answer is 48}

* Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so he starts with 300 pounds.
* He uses 280 pounds, leaving him with 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed.

 **The final answer is:** 20 pounds of feed are left after a week. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.
In a week, five pigs consume 40 x 7 = <<40*7=280>>280 pounds.
So, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.

*Solution*
1. **Determine the total number of hot dogs needed.** 
    * John needs to serve 2 hot dogs per guest.
    * Total guests = 20
    * Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests * 2 hot dogs/guest = 40 hot dogs 
2. **Calculate the hot dogs needed to be purchased.** 
    * He already has 4 hot dogs leftover.
    * Total hot dogs needed = 40 hot dogs – 4 hot dogs = 36 hot dogs.
3. **Find the number of packs needed.**
    * Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
    * Number of packs = 36 hot dogs / 6 hot dogs/pack = 6 packs
4. **Calculate the total cost of the hot dogs.**
     * Each pack costs $2
    * Total cost = 6 packs * $2/pack = $12.

cupcake money = 20 cupcakes * 2$ = ?
cookie money = 40 cookies * 1$ = ?
tray money = 5 trays * 4$ = ?
total money = ?
final answer is

 


Here's how we break it down:

1. **Cupcake Money:**
   - Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each.
   - Cupcake money = 20 cupcakes * 2$ = $40

2. **Cookie Money:**
   - Frances sells 40 cookies at $1 each.
   - Cookie money = 40 cookies * 1$ = $40

3. **Tray Money:**
   - Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
   - Tray money = 5 trays * 4$ = $20

4. **Total Money:**
   - Total money = Cupcake money + Cookie money + Tray money 
   - Total money = $40 + $40 + $20 = $100


5. **Money Left:**
   - Frances has $100 and starts with that amount.  {The final answer is $100} 


<end_of_turn><eos>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.
So, Frances earns $40 + $40 = $<<40+40=80>>80 for selling cupcakes and cookies.
The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

The original 5 children then give up and leave the group. How many children are now following the truck?<end_of_turn>
    
Here's how we can break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Identify the initial setup.**

* We start with 5 children at the beginning of the first street. 

**Step 2:  Analyze the growth pattern of the group.**

* **Street 2:** Each child gets joined by another, so the group expands by 1 child (5 + 1 = 6)
* **Street 3:** Each child gets joined by 2 more,  so the expansion is 6 + 2 = 8 children. 

**Step 3:  Record the changes in the group.**

* The original 5 children give up. 

**Step 4: Calculate the final number of children.**


* The group at the end is now 8 children.

{The final answer is 8} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

On the third street, each child is joined by 2 more so the group has tripled to 10 children * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 children.
After the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Identify the initial amount:** 
   - Mamou wants to distribute 1,360 meals. 

2. **Calculate total meals distributed:**
   - 64 meals (Friday) + 30 meals (Saturday) + 48 meals (Sunday) = 142 meals

3. **Find the remaining meals:** 
    - 1,360 meals (initial) - 142 meals (distributed) = 1,218 meals

**Solution**

1. **Identify the units of measurement.** The problem asks for the amount of money James has. This means we're dealing with a monetary unit.

2. **Define each coin's value.** 
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents
   - A dime is worth 10 cents

3. **Calculate the value of each coin type.** 
   - 25 cents (quarter) 
   - 10 cents (dime) x 7 = 70 cents 
   - 5 cents (nickel) x 2 = 10 cents 
 
4. **Add the total value of all the coins.** 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 


**The final answer is 105 cents.** 



<end_of_turn><eos>","First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents
Then figure out how much the dimes are worth: 7 * 10 cents = <<7*10=70>>70 cents

Let's break down this problem step by step:

**1. Define Variables**

* Let `b` represent the age of the older brother. 
* Let `s` represent the age of each sister.
* We know that `s = 16` (all sisters are the same age)

**2. Set Up Equations**

* We are given that one of the brothers is 12 years old and  is half the age of the older brother.
    *  ""One of the brothers... is 12 years old"" translates into the equation:  `b / 2 = 12`.

**3. Solve for the Older Brother's Age**

* Simplify the equation:  `b = 24`

**4. Calculate the Age of the Other Brother**

* Using the equation: `b = 24`, we now know the age of the other brother.


**5. Determine the Total Age**

* Total age of all siblings = (Age of the older brother) + (Age of other brother) + (Age of all sisters)

* {The total age of all these siblings is 24 + 12 + 48 = 84


 



<end_of_turn><eos>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Calculate the area of the small t-shirts:**

* Small shirts area = 3 square feet/shirt * 11 shirts = 33 square feet

**2. Calculate the area of the medium t-shirts:**

* Medium shirts area = 4 square feet/shirt * 8 shirts = 32 square feet

**3. Calculate the area of the large t-shirts:**

* Large shirts area = 6 square feet/shirt * 6 shirts = 36 square feet

**4. Calculate the total area of all the t-shirts:**

* Total area = 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

**The final answer is**: 101 square feet.

Here's the breakdown:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

* We need to find Jackie's height before the summer. 
* We know Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. 
* We know Anne is twice the size of Albert.
* We know Albert is 36 inches tall.

**Step 2:  Determine Anne's height**

* Anne is twice the size of Albert, meaning Anne is 2 * 36 inches = 72 inches tall. 

**Step 3: Determine Jackie's current height**

* Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, meaning Jackie is 72 inches - 2 inches = 70 inches tall.

**Step 4: Find Jackie's height before the summer**

* We know Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
* We know Jackie's current height is 70 inches.
* Therefore, her height before the summer was 70 inches - 3 inches = 67 inches.

**The final answer is:** 67 inches 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall

## Detailed Solution

**1. Calculate the discount on the T-shirts:**

*   **Discount amount:** $8 * 0.50 = $4 
*   **Price of each T-shirt after the discount:** $8 - $4 = $4

**2. Calculate the price of the shoes before the discount:**

*   **Original price:** $40 

**3. Calculate the discount on the shoes:**

*   **Discount amount:** $40 * 0.40 = $16

**4. Calculate the price of the shoes after the discount:**

*   **Price of each shoe after the discount:** $40 - $16 = $24

**5. Calculate the total cost of the two T-shirts:**

*   **Cost of each T-shirt:** $4
*   **Number of T-shirts:** 2
*   **Total cost of T-shirts:** $4 * 2 = $8


**6.  Calculate the total cost:**

*   **Cost of two T-shirts:** $8
*   **Cost of the shoes:** $24
*   **Total Cost:** $8 + $24 = $32




{The final answer is $32}<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4
The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $<<8+4=12>>12
The amount of money taken off from the original price of the shoes is $40 * 0.40 = $<<40*0.4=16>>16
The cost of the shoes after the sale is $40 - $16 = $<<40-16=24>>24
The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $12 + $24 = $<<12+24=36>>36

**Step 1: Define the Variables**
Let's use the following variables:
*  `e` = the total cost Ellen spent. 
*  `l` = the total cost Lani spent.


**Step 2: Calculate Ellen's expenses**
*  Ellen's cost for leggings: $100 
*  Ellen's cost for the photo frame: $5
*  Ellen's total expenses: `e = 100 + 5`

**Step 3: Calculate Lani's expenses**
*  Lani's cost for sunglasses: $30
*  Lani's cost for bathrobes: $100 * 2 = $200
*  Lani's total expenses: `l = 30 + 200`

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost**
*  We now have the individual expenses for each person.
*  To find the total cost, add the expenses for Ellen and Lani.


**Step 5: Combine the Results**

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

**1. Calculate the cost of each ingredient for 1 jar:**

   * Passion fruit cost: 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12
   * Jackfruit cost: 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12
   * Honey cost: 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20

**2. Calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars:**

   * Cost of passion fruit: 10 jars * $12/jar = $120
   * Cost of jackfruit: 10 jars * $12/jar = $120
   * Cost of honey: 10 jars * $20/jar = $200
   *  Total cost of ingredients: $120 + $120 + $200 = $440

**3. Calculate Tim's total revenue from selling 10 jars:**

* Price per jar: $50
* Number of jars: 10
* Total revenue: $50/jar * 10 jars = $500 {This number represents the revenue from selling the jars} 

**4. Determine Tim's profit:**

*  Profit: Total Revenue - Total Cost 
* Profit: $500 - $440 = $60

 
{The final answer is $60}  
<end_of_turn><eos>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Starting Cookies:**
    * Oatmeal: 9 cookies
    * Chocolate chip: 4 cookies
    * Sugar: 5 cookies

2. **Early Day Snack:**
    * Oatmeal: 3 cookies

He found a buyer who is willing to pay for half ; his collection $5 per toy, and for the other half $7 per toy. If Matthew would agree to that offer, how much money would he earn?<end_of_turn>


Here's how to solve this problem:

**1. Calculate the value of the first half:**

*   Price per toy for the first half: $5
*   Number of toys in the first half: 12 / 2 = 6 toys
*   Value of the first half: 6 toys * $5/toy = $30

**2. Calculate the value of the second half:**

*   Price per toy for the second half: $7
*   Number of toys in the second half: 12 / 2 = 6 toys
*   Value of the second half: 6 toys * $7/toy = $42

**3. Calculate the total earnings:**

*   Total earnings: $30 + $42 = $72


**The final answer is $72** 



Let me know if you'd like any further explanation or if you need help calculating anything else! 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

Here's how to break down the problem:

**1. Set up variables:**

*  Let  *t* represent the number of test tubes Igor originally planned to gather.
*  Let *p* represent the number of Petri dishes Igor planned to gather.
*  Let *b* represent the number of beakers Igor originally planned to gather.

**2. Formulate equations based on the given information:**

*  **Test tubes:**  Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested: *t* = 16 / 2 = 8 
*  **Petri dishes:** Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested: *p* = 14 + 2 
*  **Total:**  Igor had placed a total of 29 items: *t* + *p* + *b* = 29

**3. Solve for the number of beakers:**

* We know *t*, *p*, and *b*.  We can use the equation to solve for *b*.


<end_of_turn><eos>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.
On the lab bench, there were 14+2=<<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.
Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

                    The : girls are trying to ? raise money , for . a ? carnival. ! Kim . raises $320 more than ? Alexandra, . who raises $430, . and Maryam raises ! $400 . more than ! Sarah, who raises $300. How ! much money, in dollars, did they ? all raise , in total?<end_of_turn>
{The final answer is}

**Here's the step-by-step solution:**

1. **Identify the information from the question:**
    * Alexandra: Raises $430
    * Maryam: Raises $400 more than Sarah
    * Sarah: Raises $300
    * Kim: Raises $320 more than Alexandra

2. **Set up a system of equations:**
    * Let 'x' represent the amount Sarah raises.
    * Maryam's amount = x + $400 
    * Kim's amount = x + $320 + $430 = x + $750

3. **Calculate Maryam's and Kim's amounts:**
    * Maryam's amount = x + $400
    * Kim's amount = x + $750

4. **Combine all the amounts:**
    * Total amount raised = Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount + Kim's amount
    * Total amount raised = x + (x + $400) + (x + $750)


5. **Solve the equation for 'x':**
    * Combine like terms: 3x + $1150 
    * Set equal to the given amount: 3x + $1150 = $430 + $400 
    * Combine constants: 3x + $1150 = $830

6. **Isolate 'x':**
    * Subtract $1150 from both sides: 3x = -$320
 
7. **Solve for 'x':**
    * Divide both sides by 3: x = -$106.67

8. **Calculate the amounts each girl raised**
    * Sarah:  x = -$106.67
    * Maryam: x + $400 = - $106.67 + $400 = $293.33
    * Kim: x + $750 = -$106.67 + $750 = $643.33


9. **State the total amount raised:**
    * Total amount raised = Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount + Kim's amount
    * Total amount raised = -$106.67 + $293.33 + $643.33 = {$939.33}




<end_of_turn><eos>","Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars.
Maryam raises 400+300=<<400+300=700>>700 dollars.
They raise 750+430+400+700=<<750+430+400+700=2280>>2280 dollars.

If : Vanessa ran 4 miles ? and Aaron completed his part of the race : in . 16 minutes, , how long in minutes did Vanessa . take ! to complete her part?<end_of_turn>


Here's a step-by-step solution:

**1. Understand the Ratios Involved**

* We need to understand how fast Aaron runs compared to Vanessa. 
* We also need to consider how much further Vanessa runs compared to how much Aaron covers.
* The problem uses the terms ""twice as fast"" and ""twice as far"", these suggest a relationship where they run at a rate proportional to their distance.

**2. Define Variables**

* Let 'x' represent the speed of Aaron (in miles per minute). 
* Let 'y' represent the speed of Vanessa (in miles per minute).

**3. Set up Formulas**

* We know that Aaron takes 16 minutes to run 1 mile, so the formula connecting him and his speed is: 
     Distance covered by Aaron = Speed × Time
     1 mile = x × 16 minutes
* We know Vanessa runs 4 miles.
     Distance covered by Vanessa = Speed × Time
     4 miles = y × Time 


**4. Express Speed in terms of Distance** 


* To calculate speed we'll use the provided information: Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron. 
     Distance covered by Vanessa = 2 × Distance covered by Aaron 
   * Substitute x for distance.

 

**5. Solve for Speed**

* We can now express the speed of Vanessa in terms of the speed of Aaron. 


**6. Calculate Time for Vanessa** 

* Once we've set up a relationship between Vanessa's speed and Aaron's speed, we can express time.

{The final answer is}



Let me know if you'd like me to continue working through the problem! <end_of_turn><eos>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.
Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes for each mile.
She ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Relationship:** The caretaker needs to buy line based on the ratio of line per dock. 

2. **Define Variables:**
   * Let  represent the total feet of line the caretaker needs. 
   * Given: 3 feet of  line for every 1 foot of  dock. 
   * Given: The caretaker currently has 6 feet of line.

3. **Calculate Total Line Needed:**
   * Use the formula to find the total length of the dock line the caretaker needs: 
     * _Total Line Needed = (Dock Length) * (Line per Dock)_

4. **Apply the Formula**
   * Total Line Needed = 200 feet * 3 feet/foot
   * Total Line Needed = 600 feet


{The final answer is 600 feet.}

                    A fruit : vendor , bought ; 50 . watermelons ! for $80. He sold all of them , at a ; profit of . 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?<end_of_turn>


**Here's how we can break down the problem to find the solution.**

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   * Initial cost: 50 watermelons at $80 = $80 * 50 = $4000
   * Profit percentage: 25% 
 2. **Calculate the selling price:**
   * Profit = Original cost * Profit percentage
   * Profit = $4000 * 0.25 = $1000
   * Selling price = Original cost + Profit
   * Selling price = $4000 + $1000 = $5000

3. **Calculate the price of each watermelon:**
   * Price per watermelon = Selling price / Number of watermelons
   * Price per watermelon = $5000 / 50 = $100


**The final answer is $100** 


<end_of_turn><eos>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

*

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

**1. Figure out James's current age.**

* We know James is twice as old as his sister Dora.
* Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so in three years she will be 12 + 3 = 15 years old.
* James is twice as old as Dora, so James is 15 * 2 = 30 years old.

**2. Determine John's age when James was born.**

* We are told that James was born when John was 32. 


**3. Determine the age of John's youngest son**

*  


{The final answer is} 
<end_of_turn><eos>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old

*Hint: Remember to use your problem-solving skills to solve the problem!* 

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the discount:**
    *  80% of $400 = (80/100) * $400 = $320.
    * This means Mark pays $320 for the new radiator. 

2. **Calculate the cost of the mechanic:**
    *  Mechanic Cost = $50/hour * 3 hours = $150. 

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
    * Total cost =  Discount price of the radiator + Mechanic cost  
    * Total cost = $320 + $150 = $470

{The final answer is $470} ,

Here is how we can solve this problem:

**Step 1: Define variables**

* Let  `c` represent the number of chickens.
* Let `w` represent the number of cows.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on given information**

* **Equation 1 (Total Animals):**  c + w = 20 (Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total)
* **Equation 2 (Total Legs):** 2c + 4w = 70 (Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs)


**Step 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other**

Let's solve Equation 1 for `c`:
* c = 20 - w

**Step 4: Substitute to eliminate a variable**

Substitute the value of `c` from Step 3 into Equation 2:
* 2(20 - w) + 4w = 70

**Step 5: Solve for the remaining variable**

* 40 - 2w + 4w = 70
* 2w + 40 = 70
* 2w = 30
* w = 15 

**Step 6: Find the number of chickens**

 Substitute the value of `w` back into the equation c = 20 - w: 
* c = 20 - 15
*  c = 5


**Final Answer is:** 5 chickens. 


<end_of_turn><eos>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5
