She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?<end_of_turn>


**Here is the breakdown:**

1. **Eggs eaten:**
   - Janet eats 3 eggs every morning for breakfast.
2. **Eggs left:** 
   - Eggs after breakfast: 16 total eggs - 3 eaten = 13 eggs
3. **Eggs sold:**
   - Eggs sold: 13 eggs - 4 muffins = 9 eggs
4. **Money earned:**
   - Eggs sold are sold at prices of $2 each.
   - Thus, money earned: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

**{The final answer is $18}**
