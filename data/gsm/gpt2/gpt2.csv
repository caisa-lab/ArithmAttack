                <|endoftext|>A Florida woman pleaded guilty to charges and a felony for allegedly running a ""furniture scam"" that cost her five children's lives when they were just 15 years old.

Shane Ross, 35, was charged Tuesday in the state's most serious misdemeanor traffic trafficking for operating a vehicle in the mail for a total of $1,000 a week.

Ross allegedly brought in a $15,000 check for each of her children and another child in June 2012 with her driver's license to be loaded into what was considered her car.

Then, she loaded it in a plastic bag and drove away under a tree, the Palm Beach Gazette reports. Ross said later she'd only loaded the bag to the garage where she rented a home and then drove to a house to drive home the next day. After she left, the children were just 8 and $16.

When the children were grown up, this was for a wedding and two for a family home, Ross told the Gazette, her actions and decisions could be viewed on the car video the next day. Ross also told the Gazette that she was going to pay all her bills.

She was sentenced to seven years jail with 30 days behind bars.

Ross later pleaded guilty to child pornography charges, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.

She was later sentenced — after receiving only 15 days of supervised release — to 19 months without parole, according to the Guardian.

Ross' former high school classmates say that they're very proud at being able to see her go from being a victim of petty theft to not being victimized by her criminal record.

""I love the way she did it. She saved a family of three kids, now four, so she could help them out and she's been able to do that by lending her voice and being a part of the community,"" said one teenager. ""It's incredible. As a parent, you know there is a need. And we are just living right next to her.""
