                    question:
                    Janet’s : ducks lay 16 . eggs : per day. She ! eats three for breakfast : every ; morning and bakes muffins . for her ; friends every day with four.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day
Janet has ducks that lay 16 eggs per day.

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs she uses for herself
She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning.
This leaves her with \(16 - 3 = 13\) eggs per day.

### Step 3: Determine how many eggs she uses for her friends
She bakes muffins for her friends every day, using 4 eggs.
This leaves her with \(13 - 4 = 9\) eggs per day.

### Step 4: Calculate how many eggs remain unsold after selling to friends
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers’ market for $2 per egg.
So, if there are 9 eggs left unsold, she makes \(9 \times 2 = \$18\) from these sales.

### Step 5: Add up all earnings
- From her sale at the farmers' market: $18
- We need to find out how many ducks lay eggs to determine her revenue from selling them.

### Step 6: Determine the number of days required to sell all ducks’ eggs
Since each duck lays 16 eggs per day, we need to know how many ducks lay eggs over several days. Let's denote the number of ducks as \(D\).

If Janet has \(D\) ducks, then she will have \(16D\) eggs per day (since each duck lays 16 eggs per day).

We can set up an equation where \(E\) represents the total number of eggs sold over some period:
\[ E = D \times 16 \]

However, since we don't have information about the exact number of ducks or the duration of the sales, let's assume she has enough ducks so that she can sell all their eggs without any leftovers. 

For simplicity, let's say she has 10 ducks (\(D = 10\)), then:
\[ E = 10 \times 16 = 160 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings based on the number of eggs sold:
- Eggs sold at the market: \(160\) eggs
- Revenue from selling eggs: \(160 \times 2 = \$320\)

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is $\boxed{320}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   - The problem states that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - It is given that the white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber:**
   - Sum up the blue fiber (2 bolts) and the white fiber (half the blue fiber).

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Blue Fiber: 
   \[
   \text{Blue Fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts}
   \]

2. White Fiber:
   \[
   \text{White Fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue Fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt}

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.
Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in an additional $50,000 for repairs.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the increase in value due to the renovation.
The value of the house increased by 150%.

\[
\text{Increase in Value} = \text{Original Value} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}
\]
\[
\text{Increase in Value} = \$130,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = \$130,000 \times 1.5 = \$195,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Profit is calculated as the difference between the total cost and the increase in value.

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Increase in Value} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$195,000 - \$130,000 = \$65,000
\]

Thus, the amount of profit Josh made from this flip is **$65,000**.<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sprints per week:**
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Each time he runs 3 sprints.

   Therefore, the total number of sprints per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ times/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/time} = 9 \text{ sprints/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance covered per sprint:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.

   Therefore, the total distance covered per sprint is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 3600 \text{ meters/sprint}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance covered in a week:**
   - Since there are 9 sprints per week, we multiply the distance of one sprint by the number of sprints:
   \[
   3600 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 9 \text{ sprints/week} = 32400 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of feed consumed by all chickens.
- Each chicken consumes 3 cups per day.
- There are 20 chickens.

\[ \text{Total feed consumption} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days in the given time frame.
- The total feed provided over two days (morning + afternoon) is 40 cups (15 cups + 25 cups).

Since we're asked about one full day, we'll assume that the feeding schedule repeats every day.

### Step 3: Calculate the daily feed consumption for the entire flock.
- Daily feed consumption = Total feed consumption per day ÷ Number of days.

\[ \text{Daily feed consumption} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining feed after the morning and afternoon portions.
- Morning feed portion: 15 cups.
- Afternoon feed portion: 25 cups.

\[ \text{Remaining feed} = 60 - 15 - 25 = 10 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 5: Determine how much feed is needed for the final meal.
- Since there are 20 chickens, and each chicken consumes approximately 8.57 cups per day, the total required for the flock is \(20 \times 8.57\) cups.

\[ \text{Required feed for the flock} = 20 \times 8.57 \approx 171.4 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 6: Subtract the already given feed from the required amount.
- We have 10 cups left from the previous feeding sessions.

\[ \text{Final feed needed} = 171.4 - 10 = 161.4 \text{ cups} \]

### Conclusion:
Wendi needs to give her chickens 161.4 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

**The final answer is:** 161.4 cups.<|im_end|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>sys
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of each glass
Kylar buys one glass that costs $5.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost if all glasses were at full price
If all glasses were priced at their full amount, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 16 \times \$5 \]

Let's do the multiplication first:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \]
So, if all glasses were at full price, the total cost would be $80.

### Step 3: Calculate the discount on each glass
Every second glass receives a discount of 60%. This means that only half of the original price applies to these discounted glasses.

### Step 4: Determine the discounted price per glass
Since the discount is applied to half of the original price, we can calculate the discounted price as follows:
\[ \text{Discounted Price per Glass} = \frac{\$5}{2} = \$2.50 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the discount
Now, we multiply the discounted price by the number of discounted glasses (which is half of the total):
\[ \text{Total Discounted Cost} = 16 \times \$2.50 \]

Let's perform the multiplication now:
\[ 16 \times 2.50 = 40 \]
So, the total cost after applying the discount is $40.

### Final Answer
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $\boxed{40}$ to buy 16 glasses.<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheep each city has based on the relationships given between them. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Seattle:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Charleston:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

Now, let's put all these values together to find the total number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle}
\]
Substituting the numbers we found:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is {The final answer is}: 260.<|im_end|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken for the initial download:**
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - Carla normally downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   - The duration to download the entire file without any interruptions would be \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes.

2. **Account for the interruption caused by the Windows update:**
   - The update causes a 20-minute delay.
   - This delay occurs after the first 60 minutes (since 40% of 100 minutes is 40 minutes).

3. **Calculate the remaining time after the update:**
   - After the update, the remaining time to download is \( 100 - 60 = 40 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time needed to complete the download during the interrupted period:**
   - During the update, Carla can still download at her normal speed.
   - Therefore, the time required to download the rest of the file while the update is happening is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time including the update:**
   - Total time = Time before the update + Update time + Time after the update
   - Total time = 60 minutes (before the update) + 20 minutes (update) + 20 minutes (after the update)
   - Total time = 80 minutes

<|im_start|>system
To determine how far John is from his home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he travels during each segment of his trip.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time spent: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time spent: 2 hours
   - Speed: Unknown (let's call it \( v_2 \))
   - Distance traveled: \( v_2 \times 2 \) miles

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time spent: Half an hour (0.5 hours)
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

Now, let's add up all these distances:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 2v_2 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 315 + 2v_2 \, \text{miles}
\]

Since John starts from home and travels away until he reaches his destination, the total distance he has traveled must be equal to the distance from home plus the remaining distance to his destination. However, since the problem does not specify his starting point or his destination, we assume that he ends up exactly where he started (home), meaning the total distance traveled equals the initial distance from home.

Therefore, if he returns to his original location after traveling 315 miles, he would have been back at his home.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{315 \text{ miles}} \]<|im_end|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours

He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles

                    question:
                    Eliza's rate per hour ; for the first 40 . hours she works ; each week is $10. She also ! receives an ; overtime pay , of 1.2 ? times her , regular ? hourly rate. If Eliza : worked for : 45 . hours this week, how much are her earnings for : this week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Eliza's regular hourly rate.
Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the overtime pay rate.
Overtime pay is 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.

Regular hourly rate = $10
Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate × 1.2 = $10 × 1.2 = $12

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of regular hours and overtime hours.
Total working hours = 45 hours
Regular hours (up to 40) = 40 hours
Overtime hours = Total working hours - Regular hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours

### Step 4: Calculate the earnings from regular hours.
Earnings from regular hours = Regular hours × Regular hourly rate = 40 hours × $10/hour = $400

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings from overtime hours.
Earnings from overtime hours = Overtime hours × Overtime pay rate = 5 hours × $12/hour = $60

### Step 6: Sum up all earnings to get the total weekly earnings.
Total weekly earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
= $400 + $60 = $460

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$460**.<|im_end|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads = 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times the downloads from the first month.
   - Therefore, downloads in the second month = \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \)

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - First, find 30% of the second-month downloads:
     \[
     180 \times 0.30 = 54
     \]
   - Then, subtract this value from the second-month downloads:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126
     \]

4. **Total Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from all three months together:
     \[
     60 + 180 + 126 = 366
     \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366. {The final answer is} 366.<|im_end|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Toula purchased at the bakery. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts
- **Number of dozens of donuts**: 3 dozen
- **Cost per dozen of donuts**: $68

\[
\text{Total cost of donuts} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = \$204
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes
- **Number of dozens of mini cupcakes**: 2 dozen (since 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24)
- **Cost per dozen of mini cupcakes**: $80

\[
\text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} = 24 \times 80 = \$1920
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the cheesecakes
- **Number of dozens of cheesecakes**: 6 dozen
- **Cost per dozen of cheesecakes**: $55

\[
\text{Total cost of cheesecakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = \$330
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs
Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of donuts} + \text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Total cost of cheesecakes}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 1920 + 330 = \$2454
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of all the items purchased by Toula is $\boxed{\$2454}$.<|im_end|>","The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts making money from his lemon tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:**
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - He gets 7 lemons per year.

   \[
   \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5
   \]

2. **Subtract the annual cost to maintain the tree:**
   - The cost to water and feed the tree annually is $3.

   \[
   \text{Net Annual Income} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
   \]

3. **Determine the number of years needed to accumulate enough net income to break even:**

   To find out when he breaks even (i.e., starts earning money), divide the total initial investment by the net annual income.

   \[
   \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from his lemon tree.<|im_end|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5

                    question:
                    Melanie , is a door-to-door ! saleswoman. She ? sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at ; the green house, ; 2 : more to the red house, . and : half ; of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has ? 5 ! vacuum cleaners left, how ! many did ! she start with?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about how many vacuum cleaners were sold and remaining in each location.

1. **Determine how many vacuum cleaners were sold in total:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
   - She sold a third of them to the green house, so \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners were sold there.
   - After selling to the green house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
   
   According to the problem, after selling to the green house, she then sold twice that amount (i.e., \( \frac{2x}{3} \)) to the red house, making it clear that she sold all of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the green house because the next part states ""and two more to the red house."" This means no vacuum cleaners remained for the red house or any other location besides the green one where she sold all her remaining ones.

2. **Calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:**
   - The total number of vacuum cleaners sold can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total sold} = \frac{x}{3} + \frac{2x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} = x
     \]
   So, Melanie sold \( x \) vacuum cleaners in total.

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners initially:**
   - We know that Melanie ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling \( x \) vacuum cleaners. Therefore,
     \[
     x - x = 0 \quad \text{(vacuum cleaners sold)} \\
     \Rightarrow 5 = \text{initial vacuum cleaners}
     \]

Therefore, Melanie must have started with **5** vacuum cleaners.<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - Total number of students = \(20!\)
   - Percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of contemporary dancers} = 0.20 \times 20!
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dancers:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 20! - (\text{Number of contemporary dancers})
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance (75% of the remaining students):**
   - Percentage of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of jazz dancers} = 0.25 \times \text{Remaining students}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance (the rest of the remaining students):**
   \[
   \text{Number of hip-hop dancers} = \text{Remaining students} - \text{Number of jazz dancers}
   \]

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
\[
\text{Number of contemporary dancers} = 0.20 \times 20! = 0.20 \times 20 \times 19 \times 18 \times \ldots \times 1
\]
Since calculating \(20!\) directly is impractical due to its size, we can use properties of factorials for simplification. However, this calculation would be done in a computational environment or using logarithmic functions if needed.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dancers.
After determining the number of contemporary dancers, subtract that from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
\[
\text{Number of jazz dancers} = 0.25 \times \text{Remaining students}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Subtract the number of jazz dancers from the remaining students to get the number of hip-hop dancers.

Given the complexity of direct computation with such large numbers, let's assume we have computed the values as follows (for demonstration purposes):

- Let’s say \(20!\) results in approximately \(2.43290200816E+18\).
- Number of contemporary dancers = \(4.86580401632E+17\).

Using the above values:
- Remaining students after contemporary dancers = \(2.43290200816E+18 - 4.86580401632E+17\) 
  (approximately 2 billion minus 48 million, which leaves us with around 2 billion remaining students.)

- Number of jazz dancers = \(0.25 \times 2 \times 10^9 = 5 \times 10^8 = 500,000,000\)

- Number of hip-hop dancers = \(2 \times 10^9 - 5 \times 10^8 = 1.5 \times 10^9 = 1.5 \times 10^9\)

Thus, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is calculated as:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of hip-hop dancers}}{\text{Total number of students}} \times 100 = \frac{1.5 \times 10^9}{2 \times 10^9} \times 100 = 75\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \(\boxed{75}\).<|im_end|>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both the jewelry and electronics based on the given growth rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Jewelry Increase
- Initial value of jewelry = $5,000
- Jewelry grows by 2.5%

First, convert the percentage increase into a decimal:

\[ \text{Increase} = 2.5\% = \frac{2.5}{100} = 0.025 \]

Now, apply this increase to the initial value:

\[ \text{New Value} = \text{Initial Value} + (\text{Initial Value} \times \text{Increase}) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,000 + (\$5,000 \times 0.025) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,000 + \$125 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,125 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Electronics Increase
- Initial value of electronics = $8,000
- Electronics grow by 1.2%

Next, convert the percentage increase into a decimal:

\[ \text{Increase} = 1.2\% = \frac{1.2}{100} = 0.012 \]

Apply this increase to the initial value:

\[ \text{New Value} = \text{Initial Value} + (\text{Initial Value} \times \text{Increase}) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,000 + (\$8,000 \times 0.012) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,000 + \$96 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,096 \]

### Step 3: Compare Final Values
- Jewelry after growth = $5,125
- Electronics after growth = $8,096

Since $8,096 > $5,125, purchasing electronics results in a higher value.

### Conclusion
By comparing the final values, it is clear that the maximum profit can be achieved by purchasing the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 over the jewelry worth $5,000. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is}: The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets because they will yield a greater profit.<|im_end|>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled on the first day**

- Each train travels 80 miles on the first day.
- There are two trains (let's call them Train A and Train B), so we multiply this distance by 2.

\[ \text{Total distance on the first day} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered on the second day**

- Each train travels 150 miles on the second day.
- Again, there are two trains, so we multiply this distance by 2.

\[ \text{Total distance on the second day} = 150 \times 2 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Add the distances from both days together**

\[ \text{Total distance covered by both trains over the two days} = 160 + 300 = 460 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is **460 miles**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{460}
\]<|im_end|>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

\]

Since there are 50 weeks in a year, we can now calculate her total annual earnings from teaching:

\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks Per Year}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \$700 \times 50
\]
\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \$35,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a cheerleader.
Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours per week as a cheerleader.

\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \$30 \times 15
\]
\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \$450
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Jill's annual earnings from being a cheerleader.
There are also 50 weeks in a year, so we can now calculate her total annual earnings from cheering:

\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks Per Year}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \$450 \times 50
\]
\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \$22,500
\]

### Step 4: Sum up Jill’s annual earnings from both jobs.
Now, we add her earnings from teaching and from cheerleading:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Teacher Earnings} + \text{Cheerleader Earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \$35,000 + \$22,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \$57,500
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $\boxed{\$57,500}$.<|im_end|>","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of eggs per meal:**
   - Claire makes an omelet that consists of 3 eggs.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten per day:**
   - She eats one omelet per day.
   - Therefore, she eats \(3\) eggs per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten per week:**
   - There are \(7\) days in a week.
   - So, she eats \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs per week.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over 4 weeks:**
   - Over 4 weeks, she eats \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.

5. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - Since there are \(12\) eggs in a dozen,
   - We need to find out how many dozens are in \(84\) eggs.
   - The calculation is as follows: 
     \[
     \frac{84}{12} = 7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking**

- Time taken for the first part of the hike: 1 hour
- Time taken for the second part of the hike: 1 hour

Total time = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

**Step 2: Determine the remaining distance**

Marissa's total trail length is 12 miles.

She has already hiked 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Hiked distance
= 12 - 6 = 6 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the required average speed**

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

We know that average speed = Total distance / Total time

Let \( v \) be the desired average speed in miles per hour.

\[ \frac{v}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given:
- Distance to cover = 6 miles
- Average Speed required = 4 miles per hour

So,
\[ \frac{v}{4} = \frac{6}{2} \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ \frac{v}{4} = 3 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( v \)**

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \( v \):
\[ v = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ v = 12 \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of **12 miles per hour** to achieve her goal.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the initial mixtures.
- **Orange Drink**:
  - Total volume = 10 liters
  - Fraction of water = 2/3
  - Volume of water in Orange Drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters

- **Pineapple Drink**:
  - Total volume = 15 liters
  - Fraction of water = 3/5
  - Volume of water in Pineapple Drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = \( \frac{9}{1} \times 1.5 \) liters = 4.5 liters

Now, we sum these volumes to find the total volume of water initially present.

### Step 2: Adjust for the spilled volume.
- Spilled volume = 1 liter (water)

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining volume of water after spilling.
- Remaining volume of water = Initial total volume of water - Spilled volume
- Remaining volume of water = \( 6.67 + 4.5 - 1 \) liters = 10 liters

### Conclusion:
After pouring out 1 liter of the orange drink and spilling some of it, there is still 10 liters of water left in the mixture. 

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 10 liters.<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the ages of Raymond and Samantha when they have their children.
- Samantha is currently 31 years old.
- We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha.

Let's calculate the current age of Raymond:
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = 31 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = 37 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time difference between when Raymond and Samantha were born.
- The time difference in years between them is 6 years.

### Step 3: Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
- It is given that Raymond has a son who is 23 years old.

Since the time difference between when Raymond and Samantha were born is 6 years, we can determine the year when Raymond's son was born:
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = \text{Raymond's current year} - \text{time difference} \]
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = 37 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = 31 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 31 years ago from his own current age.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: 31 years ago.<|im_end|>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

   - Number of DVDs = 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

2. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers:**
   - Each of these 2 customers buys 2 DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs = 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

3. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold to the last 3 customers:**
   - Each of these 3 customers buys no DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs = 3 * 0 = 0 DVDs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the book before any discounts were applied.

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- The book cost Kyle $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- We need to find out the original price of the book before the discount.

Step 2: Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Step 3: Since the book has been discounted by 25%, it means that the remaining amount (after discount) represents 75% of the original price.

Step 4: Set up an equation based on this relationship:
\[ 0.75P = \$19.50 \]

Step 5: Solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.

                    question:
                    Henry made ; two . stops during : his 60-mile bike trip. He first ? stopped after 20 : miles. ? His second stop : was 15 ; miles . before the end of the . trip. , How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Total distance of the trip**: Henry traveled a total of 60 miles.

2. **First stop location**: Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles from the start of the trip.
   
3. **Second stop location**: Henry made his second stop at a point that was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

4. **Calculate the distance to the first stop**:
   - Total distance = 60 miles
   - Distance to the first stop = 20 miles
   
5. **Calculate the remaining distance after the first stop**:
   - Remaining distance after first stop = Total distance - Distance to first stop
   - Remaining distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

6. **Determine the distance to the second stop**:
   - The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - Therefore, the distance to the second stop = Total distance - Distance to second stop
   - Distance to second stop = 40 miles (remaining distance after first stop) + 15 miles = 55 miles

7. **Calculate the distance between the first and second stops**:
   - Distance between first and second stops = Distance to second stop - Distance to first stop
   - Distance = 55 miles - 20 miles = 35 miles

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 35 miles.<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.

                    question:
                    Gloria : is shoe shopping when , she ? comes across a pair , of boots that , fit her shoe : budget.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and reason through each step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - One pair of high heels costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much as the first one.
   - Therefore, the second pair also costs $66 (since 2 * $33 = $66).

2. **Calculate the combined cost of both pairs of high heels:**
   - Total cost of both pairs of high heels = $33 + $66 = $99.

3. **Determine the total cost of the boots:**
   - According to the information given, the boots and the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
   - Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots.
   - So, \( B + 99 = B - 5 \).
   
4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( B \):
     \[
     B + 99 = B - 5 \\
     99 = -5
     \]
   - This doesn't make sense because it leads to an impossible result. It seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the relationship between the boots and the high heels. 

Let's correct our approach:

- The boots and the two pairs of high heels together cost exactly $5 more than the boots.
- Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots.
- Then the combined cost of the boots and the two pairs of high heels should equal \( B + 5 \).

Given the corrected understanding:
\[ B + 5 = B + 99 \]

This indicates that the total cost of the boots plus the two pairs of high heels equals $99. Since these are already accounted for, we realize that the boots themselves must be cheaper than what they seem to be based on the initial interpretation.

**Final Answer:**

After re-evaluating, the boots' cost is indeed the remaining amount after accounting for the high heels and their combined price. Thus, the boots' cost is:

\[
B = 99 - 5 = 94
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $94.<|im_end|>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    ; Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio ; of 7:11. . If their , total ! age now is : 162, calculate Allen's age : 10 years from now.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information**:
   - Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11.
   - Their total age now is 162.

2. **Define variables**:
   Let \( D \) represent Darrell's current age and \( A \) represent Allen's current age.

3. **Set up the equation based on the ratio**:
   According to the ratio 7:11, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]

4. **Write the sum of their ages**:
   The total age of both Darrell and Allen is 162:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]

5. **Substitute \( D \) from the ratio into the total age equation**:
   Substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
   \]

6. **Combine like terms**:
   Combine the terms involving \( A \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{7}{11} + 1\right)A = 162
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left(\frac{7}{11} + \frac{11}{11}\right)A = 162
   \]
   Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{18}{11}A = 162
   \]

7. **Solve for \( A \)**:
   To isolate \( A \), multiply both sides by \(\frac{11}{18}\):
   \[
   A = 162 \times \frac{11}{18}
   \]
   Simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   A = 9 \times 11
   \]
   \[
   A = 99
   \]

So, Allen’s current age is 99.

8. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**:
   \[
   A_{\text{future}} = A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is **109**.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18
Since the fraction of the ratio that represents Allen's age is 11/18, Allen's current age is 11/18*162 = <<11/18*162=99>>99
If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old
