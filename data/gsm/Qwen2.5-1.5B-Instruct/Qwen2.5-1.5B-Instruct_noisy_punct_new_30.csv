                    question:
                    Janet’s : ducks lay 16 . eggs : per day. She ! eats three for breakfast : every ; morning and bakes muffins . for her ; friends every day with four.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day
Janet has ducks that lay 16 eggs per day.

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs she uses for herself
She eats three eggs for breakfast every morning.
This leaves her with \(16 - 3 = 13\) eggs per day.

### Step 3: Determine how many eggs she uses for her friends
She bakes muffins for her friends every day, using 4 eggs.
This leaves her with \(13 - 4 = 9\) eggs per day.

### Step 4: Calculate how many eggs remain unsold after selling to friends
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers’ market for $2 per egg.
So, if there are 9 eggs left unsold, she makes \(9 \times 2 = \$18\) from these sales.

### Step 5: Add up all earnings
- From her sale at the farmers' market: $18
- We need to find out how many ducks lay eggs to determine her revenue from selling them.

### Step 6: Determine the number of days required to sell all ducks’ eggs
Since each duck lays 16 eggs per day, we need to know how many ducks lay eggs over several days. Let's denote the number of ducks as \(D\).

If Janet has \(D\) ducks, then she will have \(16D\) eggs per day (since each duck lays 16 eggs per day).

We can set up an equation where \(E\) represents the total number of eggs sold over some period:
\[ E = D \times 16 \]

However, since we don't have information about the exact number of ducks or the duration of the sales, let's assume she has enough ducks so that she can sell all their eggs without any leftovers. 

For simplicity, let's say she has 10 ducks (\(D = 10\)), then:
\[ E = 10 \times 16 = 160 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's calculate her earnings based on the number of eggs sold:
- Eggs sold at the market: \(160\) eggs
- Revenue from selling eggs: \(160 \times 2 = \$320\)

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the amount she makes every day at the farmers' market is $\boxed{320}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the amount of blue fiber needed:**
   - The problem states that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:**
   - It is given that the white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber:**
   - Sum up the blue fiber (2 bolts) and the white fiber (half the blue fiber).

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Blue Fiber: 
   \[
   \text{Blue Fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts}
   \]

2. White Fiber:
   \[
   \text{White Fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue Fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt}

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much profit Josh made from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house after repairs.
Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in an additional $50,000 for repairs.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Purchase Price} + \text{Repair Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the increase in value due to the renovation.
The value of the house increased by 150%.

\[
\text{Increase in Value} = \text{Original Value} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}
\]
\[
\text{Increase in Value} = \$130,000 \times \frac{150}{100} = \$130,000 \times 1.5 = \$195,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Profit is calculated as the difference between the total cost and the increase in value.

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Increase in Value} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$195,000 - \$130,000 = \$65,000
\]

Thus, the amount of profit Josh made from this flip is **$65,000**.<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000
He increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000
So the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many total meters James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sprints per week:**
   - James runs 3 times a week.
   - Each time he runs 3 sprints.

   Therefore, the total number of sprints per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ times/week} \times 3 \text{ sprints/time} = 9 \text{ sprints/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance covered per sprint:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.

   Therefore, the total distance covered per sprint is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 3600 \text{ meters/sprint}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance covered in a week:**
   - Since there are 9 sprints per week, we multiply the distance of one sprint by the number of sprints:
   \[
   3600 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 9 \text{ sprints/week} = 32400 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of feed consumed by all chickens.
- Each chicken consumes 3 cups per day.
- There are 20 chickens.

\[ \text{Total feed consumption} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days in the given time frame.
- The total feed provided over two days (morning + afternoon) is 40 cups (15 cups + 25 cups).

Since we're asked about one full day, we'll assume that the feeding schedule repeats every day.

### Step 3: Calculate the daily feed consumption for the entire flock.
- Daily feed consumption = Total feed consumption per day ÷ Number of days.

\[ \text{Daily feed consumption} = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining feed after the morning and afternoon portions.
- Morning feed portion: 15 cups.
- Afternoon feed portion: 25 cups.

\[ \text{Remaining feed} = 60 - 15 - 25 = 10 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 5: Determine how much feed is needed for the final meal.
- Since there are 20 chickens, and each chicken consumes approximately 8.57 cups per day, the total required for the flock is \(20 \times 8.57\) cups.

\[ \text{Required feed for the flock} = 20 \times 8.57 \approx 171.4 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 6: Subtract the already given feed from the required amount.
- We have 10 cups left from the previous feeding sessions.

\[ \text{Final feed needed} = 171.4 - 10 = 161.4 \text{ cups} \]

### Conclusion:
Wendi needs to give her chickens 161.4 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

**The final answer is:** 161.4 cups.<|im_end|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.
If she feeds the flock 15 cups of feed in the morning, and 25 cups in the afternoon, then the final meal would require 60-15-25=<<60-15-25=20>>20 cups of chicken feed.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>sys
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of each glass
Kylar buys one glass that costs $5.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost if all glasses were at full price
If all glasses were priced at their full amount, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 16 \times \$5 \]

Let's do the multiplication first:
\[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \]
So, if all glasses were at full price, the total cost would be $80.

### Step 3: Calculate the discount on each glass
Every second glass receives a discount of 60%. This means that only half of the original price applies to these discounted glasses.

### Step 4: Determine the discounted price per glass
Since the discount is applied to half of the original price, we can calculate the discounted price as follows:
\[ \text{Discounted Price per Glass} = \frac{\$5}{2} = \$2.50 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the discount
Now, we multiply the discounted price by the number of discounted glasses (which is half of the total):
\[ \text{Total Discounted Cost} = 16 \times \$2.50 \]

Let's perform the multiplication now:
\[ 16 \times 2.50 = 40 \]
So, the total cost after applying the discount is $40.

### Final Answer
Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $\boxed{40}$ to buy 16 glasses.<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheep each city has based on the relationships given between them. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Seattle:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Charleston:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

Now, let's put all these values together to find the total number of sheep in all three cities:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle}
\]
Substituting the numbers we found:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is {The final answer is}: 260.<|im_end|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken for the initial download:**
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - Carla normally downloads at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   - The duration to download the entire file without any interruptions would be \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) minutes.

2. **Account for the interruption caused by the Windows update:**
   - The update causes a 20-minute delay.
   - This delay occurs after the first 60 minutes (since 40% of 100 minutes is 40 minutes).

3. **Calculate the remaining time after the update:**
   - After the update, the remaining time to download is \( 100 - 60 = 40 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the time needed to complete the download during the interrupted period:**
   - During the update, Carla can still download at her normal speed.
   - Therefore, the time required to download the rest of the file while the update is happening is \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time including the update:**
   - Total time = Time before the update + Update time + Time after the update
   - Total time = 60 minutes (before the update) + 20 minutes (update) + 20 minutes (after the update)
   - Total time = 80 minutes

<|im_start|>system
To determine how far John is from his home at the end of those 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he travels during each segment of his trip.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time spent: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time spent: 2 hours
   - Speed: Unknown (let's call it \( v_2 \))
   - Distance traveled: \( v_2 \times 2 \) miles

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Time spent: Half an hour (0.5 hours)
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles} \)

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

Now, let's add up all these distances:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 180 \, \text{miles} + 2v_2 \, \text{miles} + 15 \, \text{miles} + 120 \, \text{miles}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 315 + 2v_2 \, \text{miles}
\]

Since John starts from home and travels away until he reaches his destination, the total distance he has traveled must be equal to the distance from home plus the remaining distance to his destination. However, since the problem does not specify his starting point or his destination, we assume that he ends up exactly where he started (home), meaning the total distance traveled equals the initial distance from home.

Therefore, if he returns to his original location after traveling 315 miles, he would have been back at his home.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{315 \text{ miles}} \]<|im_end|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home
He was only able to drive 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 hours in the first four hours

He then drives another 2-.5=<<2-.5=1.5>>1.5 hours
In that time he goes 80*1.5=<<80*1.5=120>>120 miles
So he drove 120+15=<<120+15=135>>135 miles

                    question:
                    Eliza's rate per hour ; for the first 40 . hours she works ; each week is $10. She also ! receives an ; overtime pay , of 1.2 ? times her , regular ? hourly rate. If Eliza : worked for : 45 . hours this week, how much are her earnings for : this week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Eliza's regular hourly rate.
Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the overtime pay rate.
Overtime pay is 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.

Regular hourly rate = $10
Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate × 1.2 = $10 × 1.2 = $12

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of regular hours and overtime hours.
Total working hours = 45 hours
Regular hours (up to 40) = 40 hours
Overtime hours = Total working hours - Regular hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours

### Step 4: Calculate the earnings from regular hours.
Earnings from regular hours = Regular hours × Regular hourly rate = 40 hours × $10/hour = $400

### Step 5: Calculate the earnings from overtime hours.
Earnings from overtime hours = Overtime hours × Overtime pay rate = 5 hours × $12/hour = $60

### Step 6: Sum up all earnings to get the total weekly earnings.
Total weekly earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime hours
= $400 + $60 = $460

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$460**.<|im_end|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - Downloads = 60

2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times the downloads from the first month.
   - Therefore, downloads in the second month = \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \)

3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads in the third month is reduced by 30% compared to the second month.
   - First, find 30% of the second-month downloads:
     \[
     180 \times 0.30 = 54
     \]
   - Then, subtract this value from the second-month downloads:
     \[
     180 - 54 = 126
     \]

4. **Total Over Three Months:**
   - Add the downloads from all three months together:
     \[
     60 + 180 + 126 = 366
     \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366. {The final answer is} 366.<|im_end|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Toula purchased at the bakery. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts
- **Number of dozens of donuts**: 3 dozen
- **Cost per dozen of donuts**: $68

\[
\text{Total cost of donuts} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = \$204
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes
- **Number of dozens of mini cupcakes**: 2 dozen (since 2 dozen = 2 * 12 = 24)
- **Cost per dozen of mini cupcakes**: $80

\[
\text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} = 24 \times 80 = \$1920
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the cheesecakes
- **Number of dozens of cheesecakes**: 6 dozen
- **Cost per dozen of cheesecakes**: $55

\[
\text{Total cost of cheesecakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = \$330
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs
Now, let's add up the costs of all the items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of donuts} + \text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Total cost of cheesecakes}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 1920 + 330 = \$2454
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of all the items purchased by Toula is $\boxed{\$2454}$.<|im_end|>","The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts making money from his lemon tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:**
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   - He gets 7 lemons per year.

   \[
   \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5
   \]

2. **Subtract the annual cost to maintain the tree:**
   - The cost to water and feed the tree annually is $3.

   \[
   \text{Net Annual Income} = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5
   \]

3. **Determine the number of years needed to accumulate enough net income to break even:**

   To find out when he breaks even (i.e., starts earning money), divide the total initial investment by the net annual income.

   \[
   \text{Number of Years} = \frac{\$90}{\$7.5} = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money from his lemon tree.<|im_end|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5

                    question:
                    Melanie , is a door-to-door ! saleswoman. She ? sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at ; the green house, ; 2 : more to the red house, . and : half ; of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has ? 5 ! vacuum cleaners left, how ! many did ! she start with?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about how many vacuum cleaners were sold and remaining in each location.

1. **Determine how many vacuum cleaners were sold in total:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
   - She sold a third of them to the green house, so \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners were sold there.
   - After selling to the green house, she had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
   
   According to the problem, after selling to the green house, she then sold twice that amount (i.e., \( \frac{2x}{3} \)) to the red house, making it clear that she sold all of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the green house because the next part states ""and two more to the red house."" This means no vacuum cleaners remained for the red house or any other location besides the green one where she sold all her remaining ones.

2. **Calculate the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:**
   - The total number of vacuum cleaners sold can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total sold} = \frac{x}{3} + \frac{2x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} = x
     \]
   So, Melanie sold \( x \) vacuum cleaners in total.

3. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners initially:**
   - We know that Melanie ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling \( x \) vacuum cleaners. Therefore,
     \[
     x - x = 0 \quad \text{(vacuum cleaners sold)} \\
     \Rightarrow 5 = \text{initial vacuum cleaners}
     \]

Therefore, Melanie must have started with **5** vacuum cleaners.<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

Now we know that 2/3 * x = 12, where x is the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We can find x by dividing each side of the equation by 2/3, which produces x = 18

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - Total number of students = \(20!\)
   - Percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of contemporary dancers} = 0.20 \times 20!
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dancers:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 20! - (\text{Number of contemporary dancers})
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance (75% of the remaining students):**
   - Percentage of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of jazz dancers} = 0.25 \times \text{Remaining students}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance (the rest of the remaining students):**
   \[
   \text{Number of hip-hop dancers} = \text{Remaining students} - \text{Number of jazz dancers}
   \]

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
\[
\text{Number of contemporary dancers} = 0.20 \times 20! = 0.20 \times 20 \times 19 \times 18 \times \ldots \times 1
\]
Since calculating \(20!\) directly is impractical due to its size, we can use properties of factorials for simplification. However, this calculation would be done in a computational environment or using logarithmic functions if needed.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dancers.
After determining the number of contemporary dancers, subtract that from the total number of students to find the remaining students.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
\[
\text{Number of jazz dancers} = 0.25 \times \text{Remaining students}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Subtract the number of jazz dancers from the remaining students to get the number of hip-hop dancers.

Given the complexity of direct computation with such large numbers, let's assume we have computed the values as follows (for demonstration purposes):

- Let’s say \(20!\) results in approximately \(2.43290200816E+18\).
- Number of contemporary dancers = \(4.86580401632E+17\).

Using the above values:
- Remaining students after contemporary dancers = \(2.43290200816E+18 - 4.86580401632E+17\) 
  (approximately 2 billion minus 48 million, which leaves us with around 2 billion remaining students.)

- Number of jazz dancers = \(0.25 \times 2 \times 10^9 = 5 \times 10^8 = 500,000,000\)

- Number of hip-hop dancers = \(2 \times 10^9 - 5 \times 10^8 = 1.5 \times 10^9 = 1.5 \times 10^9\)

Thus, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is calculated as:
\[
\frac{\text{Number of hip-hop dancers}}{\text{Total number of students}} \times 100 = \frac{1.5 \times 10^9}{2 \times 10^9} \times 100 = 75\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is \(\boxed{75}\).<|im_end|>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the potential increase in value for both the jewelry and electronics based on the given growth rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Jewelry Increase
- Initial value of jewelry = $5,000
- Jewelry grows by 2.5%

First, convert the percentage increase into a decimal:

\[ \text{Increase} = 2.5\% = \frac{2.5}{100} = 0.025 \]

Now, apply this increase to the initial value:

\[ \text{New Value} = \text{Initial Value} + (\text{Initial Value} \times \text{Increase}) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,000 + (\$5,000 \times 0.025) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,000 + \$125 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$5,125 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Electronics Increase
- Initial value of electronics = $8,000
- Electronics grow by 1.2%

Next, convert the percentage increase into a decimal:

\[ \text{Increase} = 1.2\% = \frac{1.2}{100} = 0.012 \]

Apply this increase to the initial value:

\[ \text{New Value} = \text{Initial Value} + (\text{Initial Value} \times \text{Increase}) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,000 + (\$8,000 \times 0.012) \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,000 + \$96 \]
\[ \text{New Value} = \$8,096 \]

### Step 3: Compare Final Values
- Jewelry after growth = $5,125
- Electronics after growth = $8,096

Since $8,096 > $5,125, purchasing electronics results in a higher value.

### Conclusion
By comparing the final values, it is clear that the maximum profit can be achieved by purchasing the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 over the jewelry worth $5,000. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is}: The merchant should choose the electronic gadgets because they will yield a greater profit.<|im_end|>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled on the first day**

- Each train travels 80 miles on the first day.
- There are two trains (let's call them Train A and Train B), so we multiply this distance by 2.

\[ \text{Total distance on the first day} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered on the second day**

- Each train travels 150 miles on the second day.
- Again, there are two trains, so we multiply this distance by 2.

\[ \text{Total distance on the second day} = 150 \times 2 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Add the distances from both days together**

\[ \text{Total distance covered by both trains over the two days} = 160 + 300 = 460 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is **460 miles**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{460}
\]<|im_end|>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

\]

Since there are 50 weeks in a year, we can now calculate her total annual earnings from teaching:

\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks Per Year}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \$700 \times 50
\]
\[
\text{Annual Teacher Earnings} = \$35,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings as a cheerleader.
Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours per week as a cheerleader.

\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \$30 \times 15
\]
\[
\text{Weekly Cheerleader Earnings} = \$450
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Jill's annual earnings from being a cheerleader.
There are also 50 weeks in a year, so we can now calculate her total annual earnings from cheering:

\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks Per Year}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \$450 \times 50
\]
\[
\text{Annual Cheerleader Earnings} = \$22,500
\]

### Step 4: Sum up Jill’s annual earnings from both jobs.
Now, we add her earnings from teaching and from cheerleading:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Teacher Earnings} + \text{Cheerleader Earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \$35,000 + \$22,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \$57,500
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $\boxed{\$57,500}$.<|im_end|>","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of eggs per meal:**
   - Claire makes an omelet that consists of 3 eggs.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten per day:**
   - She eats one omelet per day.
   - Therefore, she eats \(3\) eggs per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten per week:**
   - There are \(7\) days in a week.
   - So, she eats \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs per week.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over 4 weeks:**
   - Over 4 weeks, she eats \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.

5. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - Since there are \(12\) eggs in a dozen,
   - We need to find out how many dozens are in \(84\) eggs.
   - The calculation is as follows: 
     \[
     \frac{84}{12} = 7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent hiking**

- Time taken for the first part of the hike: 1 hour
- Time taken for the second part of the hike: 1 hour

Total time = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

**Step 2: Determine the remaining distance**

Marissa's total trail length is 12 miles.

She has already hiked 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

Remaining distance = Total distance - Hiked distance
= 12 - 6 = 6 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the required average speed**

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

We know that average speed = Total distance / Total time

Let \( v \) be the desired average speed in miles per hour.

\[ \frac{v}{\text{Average Speed}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given:
- Distance to cover = 6 miles
- Average Speed required = 4 miles per hour

So,
\[ \frac{v}{4} = \frac{6}{2} \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ \frac{v}{4} = 3 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( v \)**

Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \( v \):
\[ v = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ v = 12 \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of **12 miles per hour** to achieve her goal.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the initial mixtures.
- **Orange Drink**:
  - Total volume = 10 liters
  - Fraction of water = 2/3
  - Volume of water in Orange Drink = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \) liters = \( \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters

- **Pineapple Drink**:
  - Total volume = 15 liters
  - Fraction of water = 3/5
  - Volume of water in Pineapple Drink = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \) liters = \( \frac{9}{1} \times 1.5 \) liters = 4.5 liters

Now, we sum these volumes to find the total volume of water initially present.

### Step 2: Adjust for the spilled volume.
- Spilled volume = 1 liter (water)

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining volume of water after spilling.
- Remaining volume of water = Initial total volume of water - Spilled volume
- Remaining volume of water = \( 6.67 + 4.5 - 1 \) liters = 10 liters

### Conclusion:
After pouring out 1 liter of the orange drink and spilling some of it, there is still 10 liters of water left in the mixture. 

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 10 liters.<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the ages of Raymond and Samantha when they have their children.
- Samantha is currently 31 years old.
- We know that Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha.

Let's calculate the current age of Raymond:
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = 31 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Raymond's age} = 37 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time difference between when Raymond and Samantha were born.
- The time difference in years between them is 6 years.

### Step 3: Determine the age of Raymond's son when he was born.
- It is given that Raymond has a son who is 23 years old.

Since the time difference between when Raymond and Samantha were born is 6 years, we can determine the year when Raymond's son was born:
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = \text{Raymond's current year} - \text{time difference} \]
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = 37 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Year of son's birth} = 31 \]

Thus, Raymond's son was born 31 years ago from his own current age.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: 31 years ago.<|im_end|>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

   - Number of DVDs = 3 * 1 = 3 DVDs.

2. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers:**
   - Each of these 2 customers buys 2 DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs = 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

3. **Calculate the number of DVDs sold to the last 3 customers:**
   - Each of these 3 customers buys no DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs = 3 * 0 = 0 DVDs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the book before any discounts were applied.

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- The book cost Kyle $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- We need to find out the original price of the book before the discount.

Step 2: Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Step 3: Since the book has been discounted by 25%, it means that the remaining amount (after discount) represents 75% of the original price.

Step 4: Set up an equation based on this relationship:
\[ 0.75P = \$19.50 \]

Step 5: Solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Total distance of the trip**: Henry traveled a total of 60 miles.

2. **First stop location**: Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles from the start of the trip.
   
3. **Second stop location**: Henry made his second stop at a point that was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

4. **Calculate the distance to the first stop**:
   - Total distance = 60 miles
   - Distance to the first stop = 20 miles
   
5. **Calculate the remaining distance after the first stop**:
   - Remaining distance after first stop = Total distance - Distance to first stop
   - Remaining distance = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

6. **Determine the distance to the second stop**:
   - The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - Therefore, the distance to the second stop = Total distance - Distance to second stop
   - Distance to second stop = 40 miles (remaining distance after first stop) + 15 miles = 55 miles

7. **Calculate the distance between the first and second stops**:
   - Distance between first and second stops = Distance to second stop - Distance to first stop
   - Distance = 55 miles - 20 miles = 35 miles

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 35 miles.<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and reason through each step.

1. **Identify the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - One pair of high heels costs $33.
   - The other pair costs twice as much as the first one.
   - Therefore, the second pair also costs $66 (since 2 * $33 = $66).

2. **Calculate the combined cost of both pairs of high heels:**
   - Total cost of both pairs of high heels = $33 + $66 = $99.

3. **Determine the total cost of the boots:**
   - According to the information given, the boots and the two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
   - Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots.
   - So, \( B + 99 = B - 5 \).
   
4. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( B \):
     \[
     B + 99 = B - 5 \\
     99 = -5
     \]
   - This doesn't make sense because it leads to an impossible result. It seems there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the relationship between the boots and the high heels. 

Let's correct our approach:

- The boots and the two pairs of high heels together cost exactly $5 more than the boots.
- Let \( B \) be the cost of the boots.
- Then the combined cost of the boots and the two pairs of high heels should equal \( B + 5 \).

Given the corrected understanding:
\[ B + 5 = B + 99 \]

This indicates that the total cost of the boots plus the two pairs of high heels equals $99. Since these are already accounted for, we realize that the boots themselves must be cheaper than what they seem to be based on the initial interpretation.

**Final Answer:**

After re-evaluating, the boots' cost is indeed the remaining amount after accounting for the high heels and their combined price. Thus, the boots' cost is:

\[
B = 99 - 5 = 94
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $94.<|im_end|>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.
The heels together cost 66 + 33 = $<<66+33=99>>99.
The boots cost $5 more than both pairs of heels together, so the boots cost 99 + 5 = $104.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information**:
   - Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11.
   - Their total age now is 162.

2. **Define variables**:
   Let \( D \) represent Darrell's current age and \( A \) represent Allen's current age.

3. **Set up the equation based on the ratio**:
   According to the ratio 7:11, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   D = \frac{7}{11}A
   \]

4. **Write the sum of their ages**:
   The total age of both Darrell and Allen is 162:
   \[
   D + A = 162
   \]

5. **Substitute \( D \) from the ratio into the total age equation**:
   Substitute \( D = \frac{7}{11}A \) into the equation \( D + A = 162 \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162
   \]

6. **Combine like terms**:
   Combine the terms involving \( A \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{7}{11} + 1\right)A = 162
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \left(\frac{7}{11} + \frac{11}{11}\right)A = 162
   \]
   Add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{18}{11}A = 162
   \]

7. **Solve for \( A \)**:
   To isolate \( A \), multiply both sides by \(\frac{11}{18}\):
   \[
   A = 162 \times \frac{11}{18}
   \]
   Simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   A = 9 \times 11
   \]
   \[
   A = 99
   \]

So, Allen’s current age is 99.

8. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**:
   \[
   A_{\text{future}} = A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109
   \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is **109**.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

                    question:
                    Gunter is ? trying to . count ; the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends ; how many they think ? are in the ? jar. One says . 80. Another says 20 more than half ! the first one. A third says , 25% : more than ? the first one. , What is . their average . guess?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the average guess, we need to determine each friend's guess and then calculate the mean of those guesses.

1. **First Friend:**
   - The first friend says there are 80 jelly beans.
   - This can be expressed as \(80\).

2. **Second Friend:**
   - The second friend says there are 20 more than half of what the first friend guessed.
     - Half of 80 is \(40\).
     - So, the second friend's guess is \(40 + 20 = 60\).
   - This can be expressed as \(60\).

3. **Third Friend:**
   - The third friend says there are 25% more than what the first friend guessed.
     - 25% of 80 is \(0.25 \times 80 = 20\).
     - So, the third friend's guess is \(80 + 20 = 100\).
   - This can be expressed as \(100\).

Now that we have all three guesses:

- First friend: \(80\)
- Second friend: \(60\)
- Third friend: \(100\)

Next, we'll calculate the average guess:

\[ \text{Average Guess} = \frac{\text{Sum of all guesses}}{\text{Number of guesses}} \]

Let's sum up all the guesses:

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Finally, divide this sum by the number of guesses (which is 3):

\[ \text{Average Guess} = \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

Therefore, the average guess is:

**The final answer is:** 80.<|im_end|>","The second person guessed 60 because 20 + (80/2)= <<20+(80/2)=60>>60

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time John spends caring for his dogs in a week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate daily time spent on each dog
Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day.

### Step 2: Calculate total daily time spent on all dogs
John has 10 dogs.
\[ \text{Total daily time} = 10 \times 0.5 \, \text{hours/day} \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \, \text{hours/day} \]

So, John spends 5 hours per day looking after all his dogs.

### Step 3: Calculate weekly time spent on all dogs
There are 7 days in a week.
\[ \text{Total weekly time} = 5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \, \text{hours/week} \]

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.
Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

We know from the problem statement that:
- The total number of coins is 110.
- There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

So, we can write our first equation based on the total number of coins:
\[ G + S = 110 \]

And the second equation based on the relationship between gold and silver coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

**Step 2: Substitute the Second Equation into the First**
We substitute \( G = S + 30 \) into the first equation \( G + S = 110 \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( S \)**
Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate terms involving \( S \):
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

**Step 4: Find \( G \) Using the Value of \( S \)**
Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can find \( G \) using the relationship \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

**Final Answer:**
Gretchen has **70 gold coins**.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of silver coins Gretchen has

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - We know that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - Since Raymond has 40 jewels, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels as follows:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, Aaron has 5 more jewels than 20:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]

2. **Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Aaron has 25 jewels, so Siobhan has:

   - The problem states that in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 25% more points than he does in the first 20 minutes.
   - He scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.
   - Calculate 25% of 4 points:

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets:**
   - John sold each Lego set for $15.
   - He has 13 Lego sets.

\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per set}
\]

\[
\text{Total money} = 13 \times 15 = \$195
\]

2. **Calculate how much money John spent on video games:**
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - He bought 8 video games.

\[
\text{Total cost of video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Cost per game}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = \$160
\]

3. **Subtract the cost of the video games from the total money John had:**

\[
\text{Remaining money after buying video games} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost of video games}
\]

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 195 - 160 = \$35
\]

4. **Check if there was any remaining money after buying video games:**
   - According to the problem statement, John has $5 left.

Since we've calculated that John should have $35 left but only has $5, there seems to be an inconsistency in the information provided (the problem might have an error). However, based on the given data, we can proceed as follows:

5. **Determine the number of Lego sets John originally planned to sell:**
   - We know he ended up with $5 left after spending on video games.

\[
\text{Money used on video games} = \text{Total cost of video games} = \$160
\]

6. **Calculate the number of Lego sets he could have sold for $160 at $15 each:**

\[
\text{Number of Lego sets sold} = \frac{\text{Money used on video games}}{\text{Price per set}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of Lego sets sold} = \frac{160}{15} \approx 10.67
\]

Since John cannot sell a fraction of a Lego set, he would have sold 10 complete sets.

7. **Subtract the number of sets sold from the original number of sets to find out how many he still has:**

\[
\text{Lego sets remaining} = \text{Original number of sets} - \text{Number of sets sold}
\]

\[

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    John runs ; 60 miles ; a week. He runs ! 3 days a week. .  He . runs 3 ? hours ! the : first day , and half as much . the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how fast John runs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John runs in one week:**
   - John runs for 3 days a week.
   - Each day, he runs for \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour more than the previous day.

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

- Day 1: \( \frac{1}{2} \) hour
- Day 2: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) hour
- Day 3: \( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \) hour

Now, sum up all the hours:
\[
\text{Total hours} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{7}{8}
\]

First, find a common denominator (which is 8):
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{4}{8}, \quad \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{8}, \quad \frac{7}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
\]

Add them together:
\[
\frac{4}{8} + \frac{6}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{17}{8} = 2.125 \text{ hours}
\]

So, John runs a total of 2.125 hours per week.

2. **Determine the average speed per hour:**
   - John runs 60 miles in 2.125 hours.
   
Speed can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{2.125 \text{ hours}}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{60}{2.125} \approx 28.39 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of approximately 28.39 miles per hour. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{28.39 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]<|im_end|>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.

So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the speeds:**
   - Let \( v \) be Dana's walking speed.
   - Since Dana runs four times faster than she walks, her running speed is \( 4v \).
   - Her skipping speed is half her running speed, so her skipping speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4v = 2v \).

2. **Convert given information to units:**
   - Given that Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, we have \( 2v = 3 \). Solving for \( v \), we get \( v = \frac{3}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - The total time spent traveling is 6 hours.
   - One-third of the time (running) is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time (walking) is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the distances covered:**
   - Distance running = Running speed × Time running = \( 4v \times 2 \)
     Substituting \( v = \frac{3}{2} \):
     \[
     4 \times \frac{3}{2} \times 2 = 8 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance walking = Walking speed × Time walking = \( v \times 4 \)
     Substituting \( v = \frac{3}{2} \):
     \[
     \frac{3}{2} \times 4 = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Sum up all distances:**
   - Total distance traveled = Distance running + Distance walking
     \[
     8 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 14 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

Suzy's iPhone is given to be 1 year old.

### Step 2: Calculate the age of Ben's iPhone
According to the problem, Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone.

To determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon before her gold javelin misses it, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the maximum range Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.

2. **Determine the additional range gained by holding the gemstone:**
   - When Polly holds the gemstone, she throws the javelin three times farther.
   
3. **Calculate the total range Polly can achieve with the gemstone:**
   \[
   \text{Total range} = 400 \text{ feet (without gemstone)} + 3 \times \text{additional range}
   \]
   
4. **Find the additional range gained by holding the gemstone:**
   Since Polly throws the javelin three times farther with the gemstone,
   \[
   \text{Additional range} = 3 \times \text{distance thrown without gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Sum up the total range Polly can achieve with the gemstone:**
   \[
   \text{Total range with gemstone} = 400 \text{ feet} + 1200 \text{ feet} = 1600 \text{ feet}
   \]

6. **Determine how far Polly must be from the dragon’s flames to hit the dragon with the javelin:**
   - Polly needs to be at least 1000 feet away from the dragon's flames to avoid its fire.
   - Therefore, Polly can stand \(1600 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 600 \text{ feet}\) outside the dragon's reach.

**Conclusion:** Polly can stand 600 feet outside the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with her gold javelin.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pies and slices:**
   - Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
   - Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   - Total number of slices = 5 pies * 8 slices per pie = 40 slices.

2. **Determine how many pies were actually given away:**
   - The problem states that only 5 pies were left on the buffet.
   - Number of pies taken = Total pies - Pies left = 5 pies - 5 pies = 0 pies.

3. **Verify the remaining pieces:**
   - If 5 pies were taken, then the total number of slices taken would be 5 pies * 8 slices per pie = 40 slices.
   - However, since there were only 14 slices remaining, this indicates that the problem might have been misunderstood or misstated. Let's correct this by re-evaluating the information provided.

4. **Re-evaluate the given information:**
   - There should be 14 slices remaining if only 5 pies were taken.
   - This means that the number of slices taken must equal the total number of slices minus the remaining slices.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of slices taken.
   - Then, \( x = (5 \text{ pies} * 8 \text{ slices per pie}) - 14 \text{ slices remaining} \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - \( x = (5 * 8) - 14 \)
   - \( x = 40 - 14 \)
   - \( x = 26 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: 26 slices were taken by the guests.<|im_end|>","To start the evening, there were 5 pies, each with 8 pieces, which is 5*8=<<5*8=40>>40 pieces of pie.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings in the bag
Given that 5 servings = 300g (or 1 bag), we need to find out how many servings are in the entire bag.

- Number of servings per bag = 5 servings
- Total weight of the bag = 300g

Therefore, for one bag:
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Weight per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{300\, \text{g}}{300\, \text{g/serving}} = 1\, \text{bag} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of calories in the bag
Given that there are 250 calories per serving, we calculate the total calories in the bag.

\[ \text{Total calories} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Calories per serving} \]
\[ \text{Total calories} = 1 \times 250\, \text{calories} = 250\, \text{calories} \]

So, the bag contains **250 calories**.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining calories needed
Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, but you've already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories needed are:
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = \text{Daily target} - \text{Calories already consumed} \]
\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000\, \text{calories} - 1800\, \text{calories} = 200\, \text{calories} \]

### Step 4: Determine how much of the bag you can consume based on your remaining calorie needs
Since you can only eat up to 250 calories from the bag, and you need 200 more calories, you will be able to eat all of the bag because:
\[ 200\, \text{calories needed} < 250\, \text{calories in the bag} \]

### Conclusion:
You can eat the whole bag of chips since you have enough remaining calories to do so without exceeding your daily limit.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The bag of chips is sufficient for you to meet your remaining calorie needs without exceeding your daily target. You can eat the entire bag of chips.<|im_end|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat
If each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving
We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

### Step 1: Determine how much money Charlie spends on wax.
Charlie needs 1 pound of beeswax per candle. He plans to sell 20 candles.

1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00.
Since he uses 1 pound for each candle, we calculate the total cost as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Cost per pound of beeswax} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 10 = \$200.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the candles.
Each candle sells for $2.00.

Revenue from selling 20 candles:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = 20 \times 2 = \$40.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the revenue.
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = 40 - 200 = -\$160.00 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, let's break down the information given:

1. **Monday**:
   - Number of articles: 5
   - Time taken per article (average): 4 hours
   - Total time for Monday: \( 5 \times 4 = 20\) hours

2. **Tuesday**:
   - Number of articles: More than Monday’s amount
   - Since it was mentioned that Tuesday had ""2/5"" times more articles than Monday,
     - Let \( x \) be the number of articles written on Monday.
     - Then, the number of articles on Tuesday would be \( x + \frac{2}{5}x \).
     - Simplifying this, we get \( x + \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{7}{5}x \).

3. **Wednesday**:
   - Number of articles: Twice the number written on Tuesday
   - From Step 2, if \( x \) represents the number of articles on Monday, then on Tuesday, it would be \( \frac{7}{5}x \), so on Wednesday, it would be \( 2 \times \frac{7}{5}x \).

Let's denote the number of articles written on Monday as \( m \). Therefore:
- \( m = x \)
- The number of articles on Tuesday would then be \( \frac{7}{5}m \)
- The number of articles on Wednesday would be \( 2 \times \frac{7}{5}m \)

Now, calculating the time for each day based on these numbers:

### Monday:
- Articles: \( m \)
- Time per article: 4 hours
- Total time for Monday: \( m \times 4 \)

### Tuesday:
- Articles: \( \frac{7}{5}m \)
- Time per article: 4 hours
- Total time for Tuesday: \( \left(\frac{7}{5}m\right) \times 4 \)

### Wednesday:
- Articles: \( 2 \times \frac{7}{5}m \)
- Time per article: 4 hours
- Total time for Wednesday: \( \left(2 \times \frac{7}{5}m\right) \times 4 \)

Summing up all the times:
\[ \text{Total time} = m \times 4 + \left(\frac{7}{5}m\right) \times 4 + \left(2 \times \frac{7}{5}m\right) \times 4 \]

Simplifying further:
\[ \text{Total time} = 4m + \left(\frac{28}{5}m\right) + \left(\frac{56}{5}m\right) \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 4m + \frac{28}{5}m + \frac{56}{5}m \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 4m + \frac{84}{5}m \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20m}{5} + \frac{84m}{5} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{104m}{5} \]

Given that \( m = x \):
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{104x}{5} \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of articles on Monday, and without knowing the exact number of articles written on Monday, we cannot determine the exact number of hours. However, the formula above gives us the relationship between the total time spent and the number of articles.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Candice ; put 80 post-it , notes in her purse before she , headed out ? to ? her job at the coffee shop.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of Post-It notes Candice used:**
   - She placed one Post-It note per cup of coffee.
   - She made 220 cups of coffee.
   - Therefore, the total number of Post-It notes used = 220.

2. **Subtract the used Post-It notes from the initial quantity:**
   - Candice initially had 80 Post-It notes.
   - After using 220 notes, she has \( 80 - 220 \) notes left.
   
   This results in:
   \[
   80 - 220 = -140 \quad \text{(which means she needs more notes)}
   \]

3. **Add the additional Post-It notes she purchased:**
   - She needed 140 more notes (since she started with -140).
   - So, she bought \( 140 + 23 \) notes because she ended up with 23 notes.
   
   Therefore, the number of Post-It notes she purchased is:
   \[
   140 + 23 = 163
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{163}
\]<|im_end|>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.
And if she used 220 Post-it notes at work and had 23 left, then 80+x=220+23
Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - We know that the blue ties cost $40 each.
   - John spends a total of $200 on blue ties.

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total cost of blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

2. **Calculate the cost of one red tie based on the given information:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.

\[
\text{Cost of one red tie} = \text{Cost of one blue tie} + (0.5 \times \text{Cost of one blue tie}) 
\]
\[
= 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

3. **Determine the total cost for all blue ties:**

\[
\text{Total cost for blue ties} = \text{Number of blue ties} \times \text{Cost per blue tie}
\]
\[
= 5 \times 40 = 200
\]

4. **Verify the total amount spent on blue ties matches the given information:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties.

This confirms our calculations so far.

5. **Calculate the number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

6. **Calculate the total cost for all red ties:**

\[
\text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie}
\]
\[
= 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

7. **Sum up the costs to find the total amount spent on ties:**

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties}
\]
\[
= 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

{The final answer is} 800<|im_end|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties

To determine how many pieces Tracy obtained from the wire, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit:**
   - The length of the wire is given as 4 feet.
   - Each piece is measured in inches.

2. **Convert the total length of the wire to inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in one foot.
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}

3. **Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from the 48-inch wire:**
   - Divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece.
   \[
   \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   
   Total units = Number of floors × Units per floor
   \[
   \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 = 120

2. **Calculate the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   
   Occupied units = Total units × Occupancy rate
   \[
   \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90
   \]

3. **Find the number of unoccupied units:**
   - Unoccupied units = Total units − Occupied units

                    Lloyd ; has ? an egg . farm. His chickens produce ; 252 eggs ! per day and : he ; sells them for : $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Lloyd makes from selling his eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate daily earnings:**
   - Each chicken produces 252 eggs per day.
   - The price per dozen is $2.

First, let's find out how many dozens of eggs Lloyd gets in one day:
\[ \text{Number of dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} \]

Now, calculate this:
\[ \text{Number of dozens per day} = 21 \text{ dozens/day} \]
Since each dozen costs $2, the total daily earnings can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \times \$2 = \$42 \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, Lloyd earns \( 7 \) times more than his daily earnings.

Thus, the total weekly earnings will be:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$42 \times 7 \]

Let's perform this multiplication:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = \$42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{\$294}\) per week from selling eggs.<|im_end|>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken for Tom to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM.
- The distance between 1 PM and 4 PM is 3 hours (from 1 PM to 2 PM, and then from 2 PM to 3 PM, and finally from 3 PM to 4 PM).
- Tom's speed is 10 miles per hour.

Using the formula \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \):

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to go back}} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{10 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to go back}} = 0.3 \text{ hours} \]

Convert 0.3 hours to minutes:

\[ 0.3 \times 60 = 18 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Tom 18 minutes to travel from 1 PM to 4 PM.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for Tom's journey.
- Tom travels back in the same direction but at a different speed (6 mph).

Since he has already traveled one way, his return trip will be faster, so we'll calculate the time based on the average speed over the entire round trip.

Let’s denote:
- \( d \) as the distance between 1 PM and 4 PM,
- \( v_1 \) as the first speed (10 mph),
- \( v_2 \) as the second speed (6 mph).

The total distance for both trips combined would be twice the single trip distance:

\[ d_{total} = 2d \]

The average speed over the entire journey is given by:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{2} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{10 + 6}{2} \]

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{16}{2} \]

\[ \text{Average Speed} = 8 \text{ mph} \]

Now, using the formula for time again:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{d_{total}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{2d}{8} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{d}{4} \]

We know that the distance \( d \) is 3 hours times 10 mph (the distance covered in the forward journey), which is 30 miles.

So,

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{4} \]

\[ \text{Total Time} = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes Tom to complete his journey back is 7.5 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the current weight of the book bag.
Let's denote the total weight of the book bag as \( W \).

### Step 2: Calculate the initial removal needed.
Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from the book bag.

### Step 3: Determine the current weight contribution from comic books.
Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and Uriah has removed 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight contributed by the comic books initially would be:

\[ \text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the weight of comic books from the initial removal.
Subtracting the weight of the comic books from the total removal required gives us the remaining amount that must come from toys.

\[ \text{Remaining removal} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 5: Determine the current weight contribution from toys.
Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. Let \( T \) represent the number of toys. The total weight of these toys currently is:

\[ \text{Current weight of toys} = T \times \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 6: Set up an equation to find the number of toys.
Since all remaining removal (after removing comic books) comes from toys, we have:

\[ \frac{T}{2} = 7.5 \]

### Step 7: Solve for \( T \).
Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( T \):

\[ T = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove **15** toys from the book bag.

### Final Answer:
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the mechanic on both days and then find the difference between them.

### Day 1: Mechanics Repair Truck Tires Only
- **Number of Truck Tires Repaired**: 6
- **Charge per Truck Tire Repair**: $60
- **Total Revenue from Truck Tires** = Number of Truck Tires × Charge per Truck Tire Repair
\[ \text{Revenue}_{\text{Truck Tires}} = 6 \times 60 = \$360 \]

### Day 2: Mechanics Repair Both Truck and Car Tires
- **Number of Truck Tires Repaired**: 6 (same as Day 1)
- **Number of Car Tires Repaired**: 4
- **Charge per Truck Tire Repair**: $60
- **Charge per Car Tire Repair**: $40
- **Total Revenue from Truck Tires** = Number of Truck Tires × Charge per Truck Tire Repair
\[ \text{Revenue}_{\text{Truck Tires}} = 6 \times 60 = \$360 \]
- **Total Revenue from Car Tires** = Number of Car Tires × Charge per Car Tire Repair
\[ \text{Revenue}_{\text{Car Tires}} = 4 \times 40 = \$160 \]
- **Total Revenue on Day 2** = Total Revenue from Truck Tires + Total Revenue from Car Tires
\[ \text{Total Revenue}_{\text{Day 2}} = 360 + 160 = \$520 \]

### Difference in Revenue Between Days
- **Difference in Revenue** = Total Revenue on Day 2 - Total Revenue on Day 1
\[ \text{Difference} = 520 - 360 = \$160 \]

Thus, the mechanic earned $160 more on Day 2 compared to Day 1. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$160}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kittens the Doubfired family currently has after adopting 7 kittens initially and then adding more kittens from the shelter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Adoption:**
   - The Doubfired sisters adopt 7 kittens.
   
2. **Adoption from Shelter:**
   - Their mother informs them that the two house cats (Patchy and Trixie) have just had kittens.
   - Patchy has thrice as many adopted kittens as Trixie's total number of kittens.

3. **Calculate Trixie’s Kittens:**
   - Let \( T \) represent the number of kittens Trixie has.
   - According to the information given, Patchy has three times as many kittens as Trixie: 
     \[
     P = 3T
     \]
   - Since they are both cats in the same family, we know that the total number of kittens in the family must be equal to the sum of the adopted kittens and the newly born kittens.

4. **Sum of Adopted Kittens and Newborns:**
   - They already have 7 adopted kittens.
   - Adding the new kittens from the shelter gives us:
     \[
     7 + N = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]

5. **Determine the Number of Kittens for Each Cat:**
   - We also know that Patchy has thrice as many kittens as Trixie:
     \[
     P = 3T
     \]
   - Since Patchy and Trixie together make up the family, let’s express their total:
     \[
     P + T = 3T + T = 4T
     \]

6. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - From the above steps, we can set up the equation based on the relationship between the numbers of kittens:
     \[
     3T + T = 4T
     \]
   - This represents the combined number of kittens from Patchy and Trixie.

7. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4T = 4 \times \text{(number of kittens)}
     \]
   - We don’t need the exact number since we’re only concerned with the total number of kittens in the family, not individual counts.

8. **Find the Total Number of Kittens:**
   - Summing the adopted kittens and the newborns:
     \[
     7 + N = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
   - To find the total number of kittens, we need to add the new kittens from the shelter:
     \[
     N = \frac{4}{3} \times \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
   - Substituting \( N \) back into the equation:
     \[
     7 + \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)N = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]

9. **Solve for the Total Number of Kittens:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     7 + \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)\left(7\right) = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     7 + \frac{28}{3} = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     7 + \frac{28}{3} = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{21}{3} + \frac{28}{3} = \text{Total Kittens}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{49}{3} = \text{Total Kittens}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded on the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the truck:**
   - The driver weighs \(3755\) pounds.
   - Let the weight of an empty truck be \(W_{truck}\).

2. **Determine the weight of one box:**
   - Each box weighs \(15\) pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of \(n\) boxes:**
   \[
   W_{boxes} = n \times 15
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality for the truck's total weight:**
   - The truck must not exceed its weight limit of \(5000\) pounds when carrying \(n\) boxes.
   \[
   (3755 + n \times 15) < 5000
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   \[
   3755 + 15n < 5000
   \]
   Subtract \(3755\) from both sides:
   \[
   15n < 1245
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(15\):
   \[
   n < \frac{1245}{15}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n < 83
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) that satisfies the inequality is \(82\).
   
Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(82\). 

### Final Answer:
The final answer is {The final answer is} \(82\).<|im_end|>","The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the final price Stephen paid after accounting for all additional charges.

1. **Calculate the base cost without any additional fees:**
   - The base cost of the groceries is $40.00.
   
2. **Add the delivery fee (25% of the base cost):**
   - Delivery fee = 25% of $40.00
   - Delivery fee = 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00
   
3. **Include the delivery fee in the calculation:**
   - Total before tip = Base cost + Delivery fee
   - Total before tip = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00
   
4. **Add the tip amount ($4.00):**
   - Tip amount = $4.00
   
5. **Sum up all amounts to get the final total:**
   - Final total = Total before tip + Tip
   - Final total = $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all fees and tips is $54.00. 

{The final answer is} $54.00.<|im_end|>","He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to consider both the clustered fruits and the scattered fruits.

1. **Calculate the total number of clustered fruits:**
   - The problem states that there are 6 clusters, and each cluster contains 20 fruits.
   - Therefore, the total number of fruits in the clusters is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total clustered fruits} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruits per cluster}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total clustered fruits} = 6 \times 20 = 120
     \]

2. **Add the number of scattered fruits:**
   - The problem also mentions that there are 67 individual fruits scattered across the bush.
   - We add this number to the total from the clustered fruits:
     \[
     \text{Total fruits (including scattered)} = \text{Total clustered fruits} + \text{Scattered fruits}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fruits (including scattered)} = 120 + 67 = 187

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine how many oranges are good in the basket, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of oranges:**
   The total number of oranges in the basket is given as 25.

2. **Determine the percentage of unripe oranges:**
   According to the information provided, 20% of the oranges are unripe. 

3. **Calculate the number of unripe oranges:**
   To find out how many unripe oranges there are, we need to calculate 20% of 25.
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of unripe oranges from the total number of oranges to get the number of good oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total number of oranges} - \text{Number of unripe oranges}
   \]

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Janet buys a brooch for $500.

2. **Material Cost**: The material costs an additional $800.

3. **Jeweler's Cost**: The jeweler constructs the brooch at a cost of $1300 (the sum of $500 + $800).

4. **Insurance**: Janet pays 10% of the total construction cost ($1300) as insurance.

Now let's calculate the total amount Janet paid:

- First, add up all the individual costs: $500 (material) + $800 (jeweler's cost) = $1300.
  
- Then, take 10% of $1300 as insurance: $1300 * 10% = $130.

So, Janet's total payment would be: $1300 (brooch cost) + $130 (insurance) = $1430.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of years Marcy worked at the company:**
   - She worked for the company for 40 years.

2. **Determine how many years she was not entitled to receive the higher pension rate:**
   - She started receiving the higher pension rate after 20 years.
   - Therefore, she was not entitled to the higher pension rate for \(40 - 20 = 20\) years.

3. **Calculate the remaining years she received the lower pension rate (for the first 20 years):**
   - Since she received the lower pension rate for the entire 40 years, she did not receive any additional benefit during this period.

4. **Determine how much money she saved over the 20 years under the lower pension rate:**
   - Her annual pension before the increase was $50,000.
   - The amount she would have earned in 20 years if she continued working at that rate is \(20 \times 50,000 = \$1,000,000\).

5. **Calculate the percentage of the increased pension rate based on her savings:**
   - After 20 years, she became eligible for the 5% of the original pension rate.
   - To find out what her new annual pension would be, we need to calculate 5% of her savings ($1,000,000).
   - The calculation is: \(1,000,000 \times 0.05 = \$50,000\).

6. **Verify the formula used to calculate the pension:**
   - We can also verify this by considering that her annual pension increases linearly with time. Over 20 years, her pension increases from $50,000 to the new annual pension rate.
   - This means her pension increases proportionally with time. For every year she worked, her pension increases by a certain factor. Since it increases by 5% annually, her pension after 20 years should be \(1.05^{20} \times \$50,000\). However, since the problem states she receives a fixed annual pension starting after 20 years, the increase is directly calculated as 5%.

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting will be $\boxed{50000}$.<|im_end|>","First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost for one half of the year
- Aleena subscribes to the streaming service at $140 per month.
- One half of the year consists of 6 months (since there are 12 months in a year).

\[
\text{Cost for one half of the year} = 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rate for the second half of the year
- The company charges an additional 10% off the initial amount.
- Let's denote the initial amount as \( A \). Here, \( A = 840 \) dollars.

\[
\text{Second half of the year cost} = 840 - (0.1 \times 840)
\]
\[
= 840 - (0.1 \times 840)
\]
\[
= 840 - 84
\]
\[
= 756 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over the year
- The total amount paid is the sum of the costs for both halves of the year.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{1596}

1. **Calculate the total distance Sophia can travel based on the information given:**
   - Sophia needs 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - Her tank holds 12 gallons.

2. **Determine how many full tanks she has left:**
   - Since she needs 4 gallons to fill one tank, she currently has \(\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}\) of a tank remaining.

3. **Calculate the number of miles she can drive per full tank:**
   - If she can drive \(d\) miles per full tank, then driving \(\frac{1}{3}\) of a tank will give her \(\frac{1}{3} \times d\) miles.

4. **Use the distance already driven to find out how much more she can drive before refilling:**
   - She has driven 100 miles so far.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of additional miles she can drive on the remaining part of her current tank.
   - Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{3}d\).

5. **Set up an equation to solve for \(d\):**
   - The total distance she can drive before refilling is the sum of the distance already driven (100 miles) and the distance she can still drive from the remaining part of her tank (\(x\)).
   - This gives us the equation: 
     \[
     100 + x = 100 + \frac{1}{3}d
     \]

6. **Solve for \(d\):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     100 + \frac{1}{3}d = 100 + \frac{1}{3}d
     \]
   - Subtract 100 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3}d = \frac{1}{3}d
     \]
   - Divide both sides by \(\frac{1}{3}\):
     \[
     d = 90
     \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - If Sophia drives 90 miles using a full tank, she uses \(90 / 90 = 1\) gallon.
   - Refilling this tank takes 4 gallons, leaving her with \(\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}\) of another tank.

Thus, Sophia can drive **90 miles** on a single tank of gas.<|im_end|>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the time Jim spends reading:**
   - Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV.
   - Time spent watching TV = 2 hours
   - Time spent reading = \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour

2. **Calculate the total time spent on one session (reading + watching):**
   - Total time per session = 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours

3. **Calculate the number of sessions Jim has per week:**
   - Number of sessions per week = 3

4. **Calculate the total time spent on all sessions per week:**
   - Total time per week = 3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours

5. **Calculate the total time spent on all sessions over 4 weeks:**
   - Total time over 4 weeks = 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours

So, Jim spends a total of 36 hours on both TV and reading over 4 weeks.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 36 hours.<|im_end|>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of individuals involved in the competition. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Number of teams per school**:
   - Each school sends two teams: one for girls' basketball (with 5 players) and one for boys' basketball (also with 5 players).

2. **Total number of players per school**:
   - Girls' team: 5 players
   - Boys' team: 5 players
   - Total players per school = 5 + 5 = 10 players

3. **Total number of schools**:
   - There are 4 schools.

4. **Calculate the total number of players across all schools**:
   - Total players across all schools = Number of schools × Players per school
   - Total players = 4 schools × 10 players/school = 40 players

5. **Consider coaches**:
   - Each school has a coach for each team.
   - Since there are 8 teams (4 girls' + 4 boys') and each school has a coach, the number of coaches is equal to the number of schools.

6. **Calculate the total number of coaches**:
   - Total coaches = Number of schools = 4 coaches

7. **Sum up the total number of individuals**:
   - Total individuals = Total players + Total coaches
   - Total individuals = 40 players + 4 coaches = 44 individuals

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 44.<|im_end|>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define some variables to make our calculations easier:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of diamonds.
- Let \( R \) represent the number of rubies.
- Let \( E \) represent the number of emeralds.

Given:
- There are 175 diamonds (\( D = 175 \)).
- There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds (\( R = D - 35 \)).

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Rubies
Since we know the total number of diamonds (175), we can find the number of rubies:
\[ R = D - 35 \]
Substitute \( D = 175 \):
\[ R = 175 - 35 \]
\[ R = 140 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Emeralds
We're also given that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies. So:
\[ E = 2R \]
Substituting \( R = 140 \):
\[ E = 2 \times 140 \]
\[ E = 280 \]

### Final Answer:
There are 280 emeralds in the treasure chest.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]<|im_end|>","There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know that there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Given that there are 60 girls, we can calculate the number of boys.
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Add the number of boys and girls together.
     \[
     \text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
     \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio (5 students per teacher):**
   - We know that for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher.
   - Divide the total number of students by 5 to find out how many teachers are needed.
     \[
     \text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and then combine our findings.

### Step 1: Calculate the total allowance received over 8 weeks.
Bailey receives an allowance of $5 per week for 8 weeks.

\[ \text{Total Allowance} = \$5 \times 8 \]

Let's calculate that:

\[ \text{Total Allowance} = 40 \]

So, Bailey receives a total of $40 in allowances over the 8 weeks.

### Step 2: Determine the initial amount of money Bailey had.
We know that at the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This includes her initial amount plus all the allowances she received.

Given:
- Total amount at the end = $100
- Total allowance = $40

To find out what Bailey started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount at the end.

\[ \text{Initial Amount} = \text{Total Amount at End} - \text{Total Allowance} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Initial Amount} = 100 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Initial Amount} = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes taught in one week.
- Judy teaches 5 dance classes every weekday (Monday to Friday).
- She also teaches 8 dance classes on Saturdays.

First, calculate the total number of classes for the weekdays:
\[ \text{Weekday Classes} = 5 \times 5 \]

Next, add the number of classes on Saturdays:
\[ \text{Saturdays Classes} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Total Week Classes} = \text{Weekday Classes} + \text{Saturdays Classes} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
So, there are \(25\) classes on weekdays.

Add the classes from Saturdays:
\[ 25 + 8 = 33 \]
Therefore, the total number of classes Judy teaches in one week is \(33\).

### Step 2: Determine the total number of students.
Each class has \(15\) students.

Thus, the total number of students in one week is:
\[ \text{Total Students} = \text{Classes} \times \text{Students per Class} \]
\[ \text{Total Students} = 33 \times 15 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ 33 \times 15 = 495 \]
So, the total number of students in one week is \(495\).

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Judy charges \$\(15\) per student.

Thus, the total amount of money she earns in one week is:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Students} \times \text{Charge Per Student} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 495 \times 15 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 495 \times 15 = 7425 \]
So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is \$\(7425\).

### Conclusion:
Judy makes a total of \$\(7425\) in one week.

   - Price per pot = $1.87
   - Number of pots sold = 9
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue from petunias} = 9 \times 1.87 = 16.83
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling begonias**:
   - Price per pot = $2.12
   - Number of pots sold = 17
   
   \[
   \text{Revenue from begonias} = 17 \times 2.12 = 36.04

5. **Round the total revenue to the nearest dollar**:
   Since the total revenue is already an integer (85.75), rounding it doesn't change its value.

Therefore, Artie will make $85.75 in total.

                    question:
                    Luke : is spending time at ; the beach building sandcastles. He eventually ; notices that ; each level : of a sandcastle ? will have . half the square footage as the ! level below it.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total area of all levels in Luke's 4-level sandcastle. Let's break down the information given:

1. The topmost level (level 4) has an area of 16 square feet.
2. Each subsequent level has half the area of the one beneath it.

We can calculate the areas of the other three levels using these relationships:

- Level 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) square feet
- Level 2: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) square feet
- Level 1: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) square feet

Now, let's sum up the areas of all four levels:

\[ 
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of level 1} + \text{Area of level 2} + \text{Area of level 3} + \text{Area of level 4}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[ 
\text{Total area} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16
\]

Adding these together gives us:

\[ 
\text{Total area} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 20
\]

Therefore, the average square footage per level is calculated by dividing the total area by the number of levels:

\[ 
\text{Average area per level} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Number of levels}}
\]

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[ 
\text{Average area per level} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, the average square footage of a single level is **5** square feet.<|im_end|>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

The four levels total to 240 square feet because 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 = <<128+64+32+16=240>>240
The average square footage of a level is 60 because 240 / 4 = <<240/4=60>>60

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need over the course of a year, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days.
Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.

- Number of days = 180
- Daily intake = 1 cup/day

Total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days:
\[ \text{Total} = 180 \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of days remaining after the first 180 days.
Since there are 365 days in a year (assuming a non-leap year):

- Total days in a year = 365 days
- Days already fed = 180 days
- Remaining days = \( 365 - 180 \)

\[ \text{Remaining days} = 185 \text{ days} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the daily intake during the remaining days.
For the remaining 185 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food per day.

- Daily intake = 2 cups/day

Total amount of dog food required for the remaining 185 days:
\[ \text{Total} = 185 \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total amount of dog food needed for the entire year.
Total amount of dog food needed for the entire year:
\[ \text{Total} = 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 5: Determine the number of bags of dog food required.
One bag of dog food contains 110 cups.

Number of bags required:
\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{550}{110} \approx 5 \]

### Conclusion:
Cecilia will use approximately **5** bags of dog food in the first year.<|im_end|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much laundry each person does and then find the difference between what Raymond and David do.

1. **Determine how much laundry Sarah does:**
   - We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Calculate how much laundry David does:**
   - According to the information given, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
     Therefore, \( 4D = 400 \).
   - Solving for \( D \):
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry Raymond does.
     Therefore, \( R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \).
   - Simplifying,
     \[
     R = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do:**
   - The difference is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = |R - D| = |200 - 100| = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( \boxed{100 \text{ pounds}} \).<|im_end|>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost per flower when Vincent buys 18 flowers using different package options.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of packages needed if he buys 18 flowers in packages of 3.
- Number of packages = Total flowers / Flowers per package
- Number of packages = 18 / 3
- Number of packages = 6

Now let's calculate the total cost based on the cheaper option:

### Step 2: Determine the total cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3.
- Cost per package (3 flowers) = $2.50
- Total cost = Number of packages * Cost per package
- Total cost = 6 * $2.50
- Total cost = $15.00

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost if Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2.
- Cost per package (2 flowers) = $1.00
- Total cost = Number of packages * Cost per package
- Total cost = 9 * $1.00
- Total cost = $9.00

### Step 4: Compare the two costs to determine savings.
- Savings = Higher cost - Lower cost
- Savings = $15.00 - $9.00
- Savings = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by choosing the cheaper option of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 instead of buying them individually.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $6.00.<|im_end|>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate how much water the two girls initially got.
- Each girl gets \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters.
\[
\text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters}
\]
\[
= \frac{24}{6} \text{ liters}
\]
\[
= 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls:
\[
\text{Total water for both girls} = 4 \text{ liters/girl} \times 2 \text{ girls} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much water the boy got.
- The boy got 6 liters.

### Step 3: Subtract the total amount of water already accounted for from the original amount.
- Total water initially: 24 liters.
- Water taken by girls: 8 liters.
- Water taken by boy: 6 liters.

Subtracting these amounts gives us the remaining water:
\[
\text{Remaining water} = 24 \text{ liters} - (8 \text{ liters + 6 \text{ liters}}) = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the number of liters of water that were left is **10**.<|im_end|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Alex's weight based on Grace's weight.
Grace's weight = 125 pounds.

Alex's weight is stated to be ""less than 4 times what Grace weighs.""

Let's calculate 4 times Grace's weight first:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]

Since Alex's weight is less than 500 pounds, we need to find a value that is below 500 pounds but more than Grace's weight (125 pounds).

### Step 2: Find an appropriate number for Alex's weight.
We can choose any number below 500 pounds as long as it is less than 4 times Grace's weight. For simplicity, let's assume Alex weighs approximately half of Grace's weight.

So, if we divide Grace's weight by 2:
\[ \frac{125}{2} = 62.5 \]

This means Alex would weigh 62.5 pounds.

### Step 3: Calculate Alex's weight.
Now, let's verify:
- Grace's weight: 125 pounds
- Alex's weight: 62.5 pounds

Check if 62.5 pounds is indeed less than 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
\[ 62.5 < 500 \]

### Step 4: Combine Grace's and Alex's weights.
Now that we have both weights, we add them together:
\[ 125 + 62.5 = 187.5 \]

### Final Answer:
Their combined weights are \( \boxed{187.5} \) pounds.<|im_end|>","Alex weighs 125*4-2 = <<125*4-2=498>>498.

   Let \( W \) represent the number of wins.
   Let \( L \) represent the number of losses.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   We know that the total number of games played is 22. This means:
   \[

3. **Translate the Winning Condition into an Equation:**
   The statement ""They won 8 more than they lost"" translates to:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for \( W \) from Step 3 into the Equation in Step 2:**
   Replace \( W \) in the equation \( W + L = 22 \) with \( L + 8 \):
   \[
   (L + 8) + L = 22
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many quilt blocks Gene will sew together based on his information about his vacations.

1. **Determine the number of rows per block:**
   - Since there are 4 vacations a year and he has been going on for 9 years (from age 23 until age 34), that means he has been on vacations for 9 years.
   - Given that he makes each row using blocks from a different year, he can use at most 4 blocks per row because he only went on 4 vacations in those 9 years.

2. **Calculate the total number of blocks needed:**
   - To find the total number of blocks, multiply the number of rows by the number of blocks per row.
   
\[
\text{Total number of blocks} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of rows}}{4}\right) \times 4 = \left(\frac{9}{4}\right) \times 4 = 9
\]

Therefore, Gene needs to sew 9 quilt blocks in total.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 9.<|im_end|>","Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.
He goes on 4 vacations a year, so he has been on 4 * 11 = <<4*11=44>>44 vacations.
Gene has 1 shirt from each vacation, so he has 44 * 1 = <<44*1=44>>44 quilt blocks in all.

To determine how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to consider the ringing pattern described for each instance when the alarm goes off.

1. **First Time (Today):**
   - The alarm rings 4 times.
   
2. **Second Time:**
   - The alarm rings 3 times.
   
3. **Third Time:**
   - The alarm rings \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the time that the first alarm rang.
     Since the first alarm rang 4 times, the third alarm will ring \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) times.

Now, let's sum up the number of times the alarm rang over the course of the entire day:

- First instance: 4 times
- Second instance: 3 times
- Third instance: 2 times

Total ringing instances = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 times.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 9 times.<|im_end|>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the increase rate per year
The company increases salaries by 10% annually.

### Step 2: Calculate the increase amount after one year
Let's denote the initial salary as \( S \).

After one year, the new salary will be:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S + (S \times 0.10) = S \times 1.10 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the salary after two years
After another year, the salary will increase again:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.10 \times 1.10 = S \times 1.10^2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the salary after three years
After three years, the salary will increase yet again:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.10^3 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the salary after four years
After four years, the salary will increase once more:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.10^4 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the salary after five years
After five years, the salary will increase one last time:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.10^5 \]

### Step 7: Apply the policy to Sylvie
Since Sylvie has been at the company for 5 years, she qualifies for the 10% raise on her current salary.
\[ S_{\text{final}} = S \times 1.10^5 \]

Given that the initial salary \( S \) is $600, we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[ S_{\text{final}} = 600 \times 1.10^5 \]

### Calculation:
First, calculate \( 1.10^5 \):
\[ 1.10^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

Now multiply this by the initial salary:
\[ S_{\text{final}} = 600 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ S_{\text{final}} \approx 966.31 \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service would be approximately **$966.31**.<|im_end|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let \( M \) represent the number of copies that Marilyn sold.
Let \( H \) represent the number of copies that Harald sold.

Step 2: Set up the relationship between their sales based on the given information.
We know that Marilyn's first sale was 10 times Harald's sale. Therefore, we can write:
\[ M = 10H \]

Step 3: Use the total sales to set up an equation.
According to the problem, together they sold 88,000 copies. This gives us:
\[ M + H = 88,000 \]

Step 4: Substitute the expression for \( M \) from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3.
Substituting \( M = 10H \) into \( M + H = 88,000 \), we get:
\[ 10H + H = 88,000 \]

Step 5: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

Step 6: Solve for \( H \).
Divide both sides by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Final Answer:
Harald sold 8,000 copies.<|im_end|>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many guests won't show up.
Given that 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, we can calculate the number of guests who won't come as follows:
\[ \text{Number of guests not coming} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total guests invited} \]

Substituting the given number of guests invited (16):
\[ \text{Number of guests not coming} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of guests who actually attend.
Since 16 people were invited, and 4 don't come, the number of actual guests attending is:
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = \text{Total guests invited} - \text{Number of guests not coming} \]
\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2, and she needs 0.75 bags per guest. So, for one guest, the cost would be:
\[ \text{Cost per guest} = 0.75 \times \$2 = \$1.50 \]

For 12 guests, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times \$1.50 = \$18 \]

Therefore, the amount she will spend on gift bags is:

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of potato salad needed for one adult dinosaur.
- An adult dinosaur eats **10 lbs** of potato salad.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all adults.
- There are **20 adults** at the picnic.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for adults = \(20 \times 10\) lbs.

\[ 
\text{Total for adults} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the amount of potato salad needed for one child.
- A child eats half as much as an adult.
- So, a child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5\) lbs of potato salad.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all children.
- There are **5 children** at the picnic.
- Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for children = \(5 \times 5\) lbs.

\[ 
\text{Total for children} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

### Step 5: Sum up the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children.
- Total potato salad needed = (Total for adults) + (Total for children).

\[ 
\text{Total potato salad needed} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

### Conclusion:
Ted needs to bring **225 lbs** of potato salad to the picnic to ensure there is enough food for everyone.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{225}

### Step 1: Determine the number of pets Cindy has.
Given that Cindy has 4 pets:

\[ \text{Cindy} = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pets Marcia has based on Cindy's count.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy:

\[ \text{Marcia} = \text{Cindy} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Marcia} = 4 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Marcia} = 6 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pets Jan has based on Marcia's count.
Jan has three times the number of pets Marcia has:

\[ \text{Jan} = 3 \times \text{Marcia} \]
\[ \text{Jan} = 3 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Jan} = 18 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of pets.
Now we add up all the pets:

\[ \text{Total Pets} = \text{Jan} + \text{Marcia} + \text{Cindy} \]
\[ \text{Total Pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Pets} = 28 \]

Let's break down the information given and solve for Jackson's age step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the ages relationships between Amy and Jackson.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- We can represent this as \( A = J + 5 \).

### Step 2: Determine the relationship between Jackson and Corey.
- Jackson is 2 years younger than Corey.
- We can represent this as \( J = C - 2 \).

### Step 3: Determine the relationship between Corey and James.
- James is 10 years older than Corey.
- We can represent this as \( J = C + 10 \).

### Step 4: Substitute the expression from Step 3 into Step 2 to find an equation involving only Jackson's age.
Since \( J = C + 10 \), we substitute it into \( J = C - 2 \):
\[ C + 10 = C - 2 \]

### Step 5: Solve for Corey's age in terms of Jackson's age.
Subtracting \( C \) from both sides gives us:
\[ 10 = -2 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ C = 12 \]

### Step 6: Substitute Corey's age back into the equation from Step 2 to find Jackson's age.
We know that \( J = C - 2 \), so substituting \( C = 12 \) gives:
\[ J = 12 - 2 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

### Final Answer:
Jackson is 10 years old.<|im_end|>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original running time for Gerald:**
   - Let \( T_G \) represent the original running time for Gerald.
   - According to the information provided, Gerald was 2 seconds faster than Lee when they both ran the 400-meter hurdles.
   - Therefore, if Lee runs it in 38 seconds, then \( T_G = 38 + 2 = 40 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate the new running time after improving his diet:**
   - The problem states that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%.
   - To find out how much faster he becomes, calculate 10% of \( T_G \):
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}

   We know that the number of dogs and cats together make up part of the rabbit count but not all of it. According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve more than the sum of the number of dogs and cats. So we can write:
   \[
   R = D + C + 12
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( D \) and \( C \):
   \[
   R = 60 + 120 + 12 = 192
   \]

5. **Verify Total Pet Count:**
   Now we have the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits. To ensure accuracy, let's add these numbers together:
   \[
   \text{Total Pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 192 = 372
   \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 372.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 372.<|im_end|>","If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120

The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total students are boys.
   - The total number of students is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \).

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - Since there are 200 students in total and we already have 80 boys, the number of girls = \( 200 - 80 = 120 \).

3. **Find out how many of these girls are part of the Girl Scout organization:**
   - We're told that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the Girl Scout.
   - So, the number of girls in the Girl Scout = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \).

4. **Calculate the number of girls who are NOT in the Girl Scout:**
   - To find this, subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls.
   - Number of girls not in the Girl Scout = \( 120 - 80 = 40 \).

Therefore, the number of girls not in the Girl Scout is \(\boxed{40}\).<|im_end|>","There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much time James slept:**
   - We know that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept.
   - Harry slept 9 hours.

2. **Calculate the amount James slept:**
   - Since James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of Harry's total sleep,
   \[

   \]
   - Simplify the multiplication:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Freda makes her sauce from canned tomatoes.
- The canned tomatoes have lost half of their volume when cooked.
- Each 16-ounce can contains three tomatoes.

### Step 2: Determine how much sauce was used in the last batch
Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.

### Step 3: Calculate the volume loss due to cooking
Since the tomatoes lose half their volume during cooking, the volume of the sauce after cooking would be half of the original volume before cooking.

So, if 32 ounces of sauce were made from tomatoes, then before cooking, there must have been double that amount because the tomatoes lose half their volume.

\[ \text{Volume before cooking} = 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

### Step 4: Convert the volume of tomatoes needed back to the number of cans
We know that one 16-ounce can of tomatoes provides three tomatoes.

Therefore, we need to find out how many 16-ounce cans are required for 64 ounces.

\[ \text{Number of cans needed} = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

### Step 5: Verify the number of tomatoes per can
Each can contains three tomatoes.

### Conclusion
Freda used **4 cans** of tomatoes to make her sauce, which translates to **12 tomatoes** (since each can contains three tomatoes).

So, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is: 12}}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cars initially on the motorway.
- Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes.
- In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through.
- After 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes, a total of 5 cars remain in the jam.
- Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is 5 (initially) + 20 (after 20 more) = **25** cars.

### Step 3: Verify the logic for the last part of the question.
- The initial number of cars was 30, but only 25 cars actually drove through during the 15-minute period.
- This means that 5 cars took an exit after driving through the jam, leaving 20 cars still on the motorway.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is **25**.

{The final answer is} 25.<|im_end|>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:**
   - Mary already has 2 potted plants.
   - She receives 18 new potted plants yesterday.

   Total current number of potted plants = 2 + 18 = 20 potted plants.

2. **Calculate how many potted plants Mary gives away:**
   - Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
   - Number of ledges = 40.
   
   Number of potted plants given away = 40 * 1 = 40 potted plants.

3. **Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants Mary originally had:**
   - Total number of potted plants initially = 20.
   - Number of potted plants given away = 40.
   
   Final count of potted plants Mary will have left = 20 - 40 = -20.

Since it's not possible for Mary to end up with negative numbers of potted plants, there must be an error in the initial conditions or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the given information:

- If Mary has 20 potted plants at the start and adds 18 more, she would have 38 plants (not 20).
- The calculation of giving away 40 plants seems incorrect based on the initial condition.

Given these issues, let's correct our approach:

1. **Recheck the initial condition:**
   - Mary starts with 20 potted plants.
   - She receives 18 more, so she now has 38 plants.

2. **Re-calculate the number of potted plants given away correctly:**
   - Mary gives away 1 potted plant per ledge, which means she gives away 1 potted plant per ledge, but since she only has 38 plants, she can't give away all 18 she received yesterday without exceeding her available stock.

Therefore, Mary cannot fulfill her intention of giving away all 18 she received yesterday because she doesn't have enough potted plants to do so. 

Hence, the correct conclusion should indicate that Mary does not have enough potted plants to give any away according to her plan as calculated.

**Final Answer:** Mary will not have enough potted plants to give any away. Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is 0.<|im_end|>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants

Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

   - There were 4 friends in total.
   - Each friend pressed the doorbell a specific number of times.

2. **Sum up the total number of presses:**
   - First friend: 20 presses
   - Second friend: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 20 = 15 \) presses (since 20 is \( \frac{4}{3} \) of Jerome’s press)
   - Third friend: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) presses (since the third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend)
   - Fourth friend: 60 presses

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.
Solo reads three different textbooks:

- Science: \( \frac{4}{\text{pages per page}} = 4 \) pages
- Social Studies: \( \frac{20}{\text{pages per page}} = 20 \) pages
- History: \( \frac{7}{\text{pages per page}} = 7 \) pages
- Geography: \( \frac{8}{\text{pages per page}} = 8 \) pages

Adding these up gives the total number of pages needed:
\[ 
\text{Total Pages} = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of days left for Solo to finish his reading.
We know that Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Let's denote the remaining days as \( x \).

Given that he has \( 4 - x \) days left to complete his reading, we can write an equation based on the total number of pages:
\[ 
(4 - x) \times (x \times \text{average pages per day}) = 39 
\]
where \( x \) represents the number of days left.

### Step 3: Find the average number of pages Solo should read per day.
Let’s rearrange the equation to find the average number of pages per day:
\[ 
(x \times \text{average pages per day}) = \frac{39}{4 - x}
\]

Since we want to find the average number of pages per day over the remaining days, we can express this as:
\[ 
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\frac{39}{4 - x}}{x} = \frac{39}{x(4 - x)}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression.
Now we need to simplify this fraction further. However, since we don't have any specific values for \( x \), we'll leave it in terms of \( x \):
\[ 
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{39}{x(4 - x)}
\]

This is the expression representing the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day if he finishes all his reading within the remaining \( x \) days.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{39}{x(4 - x)}}
\]<|im_end|>","Solo has to read a total of 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = <<4+20+7+8=39>>39 pages.

To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break down his drinking routine:

1. **Breakfast**: He drinks 1 glass of water.
2. **Lunch**: He drinks another 1 glass of water.
3. **Dinner (every day)**: He drinks 1 glass of water.

Now we need to calculate the total for the weekdays (Monday to Friday):
- Breakfast + Lunch = 1 + 1 = 2 glasses per day
- Weekdays: 5 days * 2 glasses/day = 10 glasses

For the weekend:
- He alternates between drinking water and having soda at dinner.
- On Saturday evening, he drinks 1 glass of water.
- On Sunday evening, he drinks 1 glass of water.
- Weekend: 2 days * 1 glass/day = 2 glasses

Finally, add up all the glasses:
Weekday glasses + Weekend glasses = Total glasses

Let's do the math:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it would take for the fog bank to completely cover the entire city given that it covers 3 miles every 10 minutes.

Here’s the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance covered per minute.
- The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, in one minute, the fog bank covers \( \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \) miles.

### Step 2: Determine the number of minutes required to cover the full city.
- The city's width is 42 miles.
- To find out how many minutes it takes to cover all 42 miles at a rate of 0.3 miles per minute, we divide the total distance by the coverage per minute.
  
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Distance Covered Per Minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles/minute}} \]

### Step 3: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{42}{0.3} \]

### Step 4: Simplify the division.
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{42}{0.3} = \frac{42}{\frac{3}{10}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} \]

### Step 5: Multiply the numbers.
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

Therefore, it will take **140 minutes** for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

                    question:
                    Poppy is solving a 1000-piece jigsaw ? puzzle. She places a quarter ! of the pieces on : the board, then her ! mom places . a third of the remaining ? pieces. How . many . jigsaw pieces ; are left ! to be placed?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many pieces Poppy places initially**
- The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 1000.
- Poppy places a quarter (1/4) of the pieces on the board.
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \)

So, after Poppy places 250 pieces, there are \( 1000 - 250 = 750 \) pieces left.

**Step 2: Calculate how many pieces her mom places**
- Her mom places a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \)

So, her mom places 250 more pieces on the board.

**Step 3: Determine how many pieces are left to be placed**
- After both Poppy and her mom place their respective numbers of pieces,
- We need to subtract these from the initial count of 1000 pieces.
- Calculation: \( 1000 - 250 - 250 = 500 \)

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces that are left to be placed is **500**.<|im_end|>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies Cody eats:**
   - We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir.
   - Given that Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. **Calculate the number of cookies Cody eats:**
   \[
   \text{Cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times (\text{Cookies Amir eats})

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find the total inner volume of the three boxes, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of one box.
Each box has an outer dimension of 5 inches (length) × 6 inches (width) × 4 inches (height).

- **Length**: 5 inches
- **Width**: 6 inches
- **Height**: 4 inches

Since the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, we subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch per wall thickness on both ends).

- **Inner Length**: \(5 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 3 \text{ inches}\)
- **Inner Width**: \(6 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 6 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 4 \text{ inches}\)
- **Inner Height**: \(4 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 4 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}\)

### Step 2: Calculate the volume of one box.
The volume of one box can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[
V_{\text{box}} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height}
\]

Substitute the inner dimensions into this formula:

\[
V_{\text{box}} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume of all three boxes.
Multiply the volume of one box by the number of boxes:

\[
\text{Total Volume} = V_{\text{one box}} \times \text{Number of Boxes}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total Volume} = 24 \text{ cubic inches} \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total inner volume of all three boxes is {The final answer is} 72 cubic inches.<|im_end|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension

Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break down Frank's television viewing habits over the week and determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Monday and Tuesday:
Frank watched one hour (60 minutes) of his favorite show each night from Monday to Tuesday. 
\[ \text{Total time watched} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

#### Wednesday:
On Wednesday, Frank watched several episodes of a 30-minute show.
Let \( x \) represent the number of 30-minute shows he watched.

We know that the total time spent watching TV on Wednesday was less than or equal to 90 minutes (since he only watched until Friday).
\[ 30x \leq 90 \]
\[ x \leq 3 \]

#### Thursday:
On Thursday, Frank finished his homework early and watched a 1-hour (60 minutes) and a 30-minute show.
\[ \text{Total time watched} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

#### Friday:
On Friday, Frank stayed up late to watch two 1-hour episodes.
\[ \text{Total time watched} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

#### Total Time Watched:
Summing up the time Frank watched from Monday to Friday:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes (Monday and Tuesday)} + 30x \text{ minutes (Wednesday)} + 90 \text{ minutes (Thursday)} + 120 \text{ minutes (Friday)} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Convert 7 hours into minutes:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} = 420 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, set up the equation based on the total time watched:
\[ 120 + 30x + 90 + 120 = 420 \]
\[ 350 + 30x = 420 \]
\[ 30x = 420 - 350 \]
\[ 30x = 70 \]
\[ x = \frac{70}{30} \]
\[ x = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.33 \]

Since \( x \) must be an integer representing whole episodes, Frank watched approximately 2 full 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frank watched on Wednesday is **2**.<|im_end|>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
Henry plans to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Therefore, he aims to bake:
\[ 2x \]
cookies for the competition.

When he bakes these cookies, he finds that he actually baked 15 more cookies than intended. So, he ends up baking:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, he drops 5 cookies on the way to cooling. Thus, he has:
\[ (2x + 15 - 5) = 2x + 10 \]

We know from the problem statement that after dropping some, he has a total of 110 cookies. This gives us our equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
First, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{50}
\]<|im_end|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - The price of one gallon of gas is $3.00.
   - Someone buys 10 gallons of gas.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 \times \$3.00 = \$30.00
   \]

2. **Determine the cashback reward:**
   - The company offers $0.20 in cashback per gallon.
   - For 10 gallons, the cashback amount would be:
   
   \[
   \text{Cashback amount} = 10 \times \$0.20 = \$2.00
   \]

3. **Subtract the cashback from the total cost:**
   - Subtracting the cashback from the total cost will give us the net amount paid.

   \[
   \text{Net amount paid} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00
   \]

4. **Final calculation:**
   - After applying the cashback, the person pays $28.00 for 10 gallons of gas.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $28.00.<|im_end|>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups in each person's roll-up.
- **Beatrice's roll-ups**: 
  - Width: 2 (wide)
  - Length: 24 (rolls per width)

  \[
  \text{Total rolls for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length}
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Total rolls for Beatrice} = 2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

- **Marcell's roll-ups**:
  - Width: 3 (wide)
  - Length: 14 (rolls per width)

  \[
  \text{Total rolls for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length}
  \]
  
  \[
  \text{Total rolls for Marcell} = 3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

### Step 2: Determine which person had more roll-ups.

Since Marcell has 42 roll-ups and Beatrice has 48 roll-ups, it's clear that Beatrice has more roll-ups than Marcell.

### Step 3: Calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten per person.

Both people have eaten all their roll-ups. Therefore, we simply divide the total number of roll-ups each person has by the number of people (which is 2).

\[
\text{Average roll-ups per person} = \frac{\text{Total roll-ups}}{\text{Number of people}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Average roll-ups per person} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
\]

\[
\text{Average roll-ups per person} = \frac{42}{2} = 21
\]

### Conclusion:
Beatrice ate an average of 24 roll-ups per person, while Marcell ate an average of 21 roll-ups per person. Since Beatrice has more roll-ups, she wins the contest.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{The final answer is The winner is Beatrice!}<|im_end|>","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Julia to reach the shore and then calculate the amount of water that has leaked into the boat.

1. **Calculate the speed at which Julia rows:**
   - Time taken to row 20 feet = 16 seconds.
   - Speed (in feet per second) = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet/second.

2. **Determine the distance from Julia's starting point to the shore:**
   - Total distance to shore = 64 seconds * 1.25 feet/second = 80 feet.

3. **Calculate the total time it takes Julia to reach the shore:**
   - Time taken to row 80 feet = 64 seconds.

4. **Determine the rate at which water leaks into the boat:**
   - For every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water.
   - Since Julia is rowing at a rate of 1.25 feet/second, in one second she will row \( \frac{1}{1.25} = 0.8 \) feet.
   - Therefore, the number of 10-foot segments in 80 feet = 80 / 10 = 8 segments.
   - Water leakage rate = 2 liters/8 segments = 0.25 liters/segment.

5. **Calculate the total amount of water that has leaked into the boat by the time Julia reaches the shore:**
   - Amount of water leaked = 0.25 liters/segment * 8 segments = 2 liters.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.

                    question:
                    Jamal's : phone , can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone.  ; The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's ? phone ! can hold ! is 50 times more than the , number of , birds ; in Jamal's photograph of , the ducks at the ; zoo.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the maximum number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

### Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
- According to the problem, Jamal's phone holds 6 times as many photographs as Brittany's phone.
- Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1}{6} \) of what Jamal's phone can hold.
\[ \text{Brittany's phone capacity} = \frac{1}{6} \times 1800 \]

Let's perform the calculation for Brittany's phone capacity:
\[ \frac{1}{6} \times 1800 = 300 \]
So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of photographs in Brittany's photo of the ducks at the zoo.
- The problem states that the number of ducks visible in Jamal's photograph is 50 times the number of birds in the picture.
- We need to find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph given that the total number of photographs (1800) represents the total number of ducks and birds in the picture.

Let's denote the total number of ducks in the picture as \( D \). Then the total number of birds as \( B \).

Given:
\[ D + B = 1800 \]

From the problem, we know:
\[ D = 50B \]

Substitute \( D \) from the above equation into the total number of pictures:
\[ 50B + B = 1800 \]
\[ 51B = 1800 \]

Now, solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{51} \approx 35.294 \]

Since the number of birds must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:
\[ B = 36 \]

Therefore, there are 36 birds in the picture.

### Step 4: Find the number of ducks visible in Jamal's photograph.
- Since the total number of ducks is 50 times the number of birds:
\[ D = 50 \times 36 \]
\[ D = 1800 \]

Thus, the number of ducks visible in Jamal's photograph is **1800**.<|im_end|>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.
Since Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photos than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, then 300/50=6 ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.

                    question:
                    : Sasha . notices that prices for ; lumber have gone up 50% . in the last ? few months ? after she bought ! some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling both types of lumber and then determine the profit based on the initial cost.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of one board:**
   - Sasha buys 10 boards at $10 each.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100
     \]
   
2. **Calculate the total cost for 2x4x10 boards (since she bought 10 of these):**
   - Each 2x4x10 board costs $10.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 4x4x10 boards (since she bought 5 of these):**
   - Each 4x4x10 board costs $16.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$16 = \$80
     \]

4. **Sum up the total costs:**
   - Total cost for 2x4x10 boards: $100
   - Total cost for 4x4x10 boards: $80
   - Total cost for both types of lumber: 
     \[
     \$100 + \$80 = \$180
     \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all boards:**
   - Sasha sells all her boards.
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = (\text{Number of 2x4x10 boards} \times \$10) + (\text{Number of 4x4x10 boards} \times \$16)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = (10 \times \$10) + (5 \times \$16) = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
     \]

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$0}
\]<|im_end|>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100
She bought the 4 x 4s for 80 because 5 x 16 = 80

The same number now sells for $270 because 180 x 1.5 = <<180*1.5=270>>270
She made $90 in profit because 270 - 180 = <<270-180=90>>90

                    question:
                    Katy makes . coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of ! 7:13. If she ? used a total of , 120 , teaspoons of sugar and ! cups of ! water, calculate : the number of ! teaspoonfuls ; of ! sugar she used.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used based on the given ratio and total amounts of sugar and water.

Step 1: Understand the ratio
The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of sugar per part
Since there are 7 parts of sugar for every 13 parts of water, the amount of sugar per part can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sugar per part} = \frac{\text{Total sugar}}{7}
\]

Given that the total amount of sugar is 120 teaspoons, we substitute this into the equation:

\[
\text{Sugar per part} = \frac{120}{7}
\]

Performing the division gives us:

\[
\text{Sugar per part} = 17.14 \text{ teaspoons (approximately)}
\]

However, since the question asks for the exact number of teaspoonfuls, we will use the whole number part without rounding up or down because it's not specified what happens if the remaining quantity isn't a full part.

Step 3: Determine the total number of parts
There are 13 parts of water, so the total number of parts is:

\[
\text{Total parts} = 13
\]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of teaspoonfuls of sugar
Multiply the number of parts by the amount of sugar per part:

\[
\text{Total sugar} = \text{Total parts} \times \text{Sugar per part}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total sugar} = 13 \times 17.14 \approx 222.92 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Again, since the question asks for the exact number of teaspoonfuls, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because we're dealing with an approximate value from our earlier calculation:

\[
\text{Total sugar} = 222 \text{ teaspoonfuls}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: 222 teaspoonfuls of sugar.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20
Since the fraction representing the number of teaspoons she used is 7/20, she used 7/20*120 = <<7/20*120=42>>42

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much John paid in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pairs of shoes:**
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.

\[
\text{Total pairs} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Pairs per child}
\]
\[
\text{Total pairs} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pairs}
\]

2. **Determine the cost per pair of shoes:**
   - Each pair costs $60.

\[
\text{Cost per pair} = \$60
\]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Counting**:
   - On the first day, there were 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles.
   - Total vehicles from the first day: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day**:
   - On the second day, more containers were brought in, and the total number of vehicles increased to 30.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
   - Since each container still contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles after the second day can be represented as: \(10 + x \times 5\).

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the information provided, the equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is: 
     \[
     10 + 5x = 30
     \]

4. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   - To find \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: 
     \[
     5x = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     x = 4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
   - His salary has increased to 40% more than that amount.
   - Calculate the increase in Adrien's salary:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times 40,000 = 16,000
     \]
   - Add the increase to his original salary:
     \[
     \text{Adrien's current salary} = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000
     \]

2. **Calculate Lylah's current salary:**
   - Let \( x \) be Lylah's original salary.
   - According to the problem, Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Therefore, Adrien's salary can also be expressed as:
     \[
     1.3x = 56,000
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{56,000}{1.3}
     \]
     \[
     x \approx 43,076.92
     \]

3. **Verify if their salaries increased simultaneously:**
   - The problem states that both their salaries increased at the same rate over time.
   - Since we have calculated the increase directly from Adrien's data, we assume Lylah's salary would also increase proportionally based on her original salary.
   - This assumption holds true given the information provided.

4. **Calculate the combined total salary after four years:**
   - Both Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased proportionally.
   - Let \( y \) be their combined salary four years later.
   - Since their increases are proportional, their salaries will add up to \( y \).

Given the calculations:

- Adrien's current salary: $56,000
- Lylah's original salary (which is assumed to increase proportionally): approximately $43,076.92

Adding these together gives:
\[
y = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
\]

Therefore, the total salary they were receiving four years later is $\boxed{99,076.92}$.<|im_end|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000

   - Since each pad contains 30 sheets, 2 pads contain \(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets per week.

3. **Find out how many weeks there are in a month:**
   - Typically, a month has approximately 4 full weeks plus an extra day or two depending on the specific month (e.g., April has 5 weeks).

4. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a month:**
   - If we assume a month has exactly 4 weeks (which is a common approximation), then in one month, he would use \(4 \times 60 = 240\) sheets.
   
5. **Verify if the assumption about a month having 4 weeks holds true:**
   - If there were more than 4 weeks in the month, the calculation would be slightly different but still follows the same pattern where you multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in the month.

Since the exact number of days in a month can vary based on the specific month, the general approach to calculate monthly usage remains consistent. Therefore, the formula will always involve multiplying the weekly usage by the approximate number of weeks in a month.

   - Kael brings twice as many apples as Morisette.
   - Kael brings half as many oranges as Morisette.

2. **Calculate the number of apples and oranges Kael brings:**
   - Since Kael brings twice as many apples as Morisette, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Apples from Kael} = 2 \times (\text{Apples from Morisette}) = 2 \times 5 = 10

**Step 2: Calculate the total hours of sleep for the first three days**

Total sleep for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
= Monday's sleep + Tuesday's sleep + Wednesday's sleep
= 8 hours + 6 hours + 4 hours
= 18 hours

**Step 3: Determine the number of hours Sadie slept on Thursday**

Thursday's sleep = Total sleep for the first three days + 1 hour
Thursday's sleep = 18 hours + 1 hour
Thursday's sleep = 19 hours

**Step 4: Determine the number of hours Sadie slept on Friday**

Friday's sleep = Total sleep for the first four days (including Thursday) + 1 hour
Friday's sleep = 18 hours + 1 hour
Friday's sleep = 19 hours

**Step 5: Determine the number of hours Sadie slept on Saturday and Sunday**

Saturday's sleep = Total sleep for the last two days (including Friday) + 1 hour
Saturday's sleep = 19 hours + 1 hour
Saturday's sleep = 20 hours

Sunday's sleep = Total sleep for the entire week (including Saturday)
Sunday's sleep = 20 hours + 1 hour
Sunday's sleep = 21 hours

**Step 6: Calculate the total hours of sleep for the entire week**

Total sleep for the week
= Monday's sleep + Tuesday's sleep + Wednesday's sleep + Thursday's sleep + Friday's sleep + Saturday's sleep + Sunday's sleep
= 8 hours + 6 hours + 4 hours + 19 hours + 19 hours + 20 hours + 21 hours
= 107 hours

Therefore, Sadie slept a total of **107 hours** throughout the week.<|im_end|>","If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.

If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.

                    question:
                    Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for . 3 hours. , After that, she runs ; 5 miles ? per hour. ! How many ! miles ; can she ! run in 7 hours?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Rosie's distance during her first run.
Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 0.3 hours.

Distance = Speed × Time

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \times 0.3 \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 3 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Rosie's distance during her second run.
After her first run, Rosie increases her speed to 5 miles per hour and continues running for another 7 - 0.3 = 6.7 hours.

Distance = Speed × Time

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \times 6.7 \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 33.5 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 3: Add both distances together.
Total distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2

So,
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 3 + 33.5 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 36.5 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is \(36.5\) miles. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36.5}
\]<|im_end|>","For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.
However, she still has 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 hours left to room.
For the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.
In total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.

                    question:
                    Jennie is helping at her mom's : office. She has a pile of , 60 letters needing ? stamps, , and a pile of letters . already stamped.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of letters that were initially in the stamp-piled letters before Jennie started working. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of letters in the stamp-piled letters.
   - We know from the problem statement that there are 30 letters left in the stamp-piled letters after she adds stamps to some of them.

2. **Calculate Total Letters Needed Stamped:**
   - There are 60 letters needing stamps.

3. **Determine Number of Letters Added to Stamp-Piled Letters:**
   - One-third of these letters are added to the stamp-piled letters, so the number of letters added is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).

4. **Set Up Equation for Remaining Letters in Stamp-Piled Pile:**
   - After adding the letters, the remaining letters in the stamp-piled pile should equal 30.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     (x - 20) + 30 = x
     \]
     Here, \( x - 20 \) represents the letters in the stamp-piled pile after adding stamps, and \( 30 \) represents the letters already in the stamp-piled pile.

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x - 20 + 30 = x \\
     x + 10 = x
     \]
   - Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
     \[
     10 = 0
     \]

This results in an incorrect equation because we made an assumption about the initial letter count which isn't necessary. Instead, let’s directly calculate based on the given information:

- Jennie starts with 60 letters needing stamps.
- She adds stamps to one-third of these letters, i.e., \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).
- This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters not yet stamped.
- After adding stamps to the letters needed, she ends up with 30 letters still needing stamps.

Thus, initially, the number of letters in the stamp-piled pile was:
\[
x = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Julia was preparing for a dinner or party.
   - She intended to serve stew.
   - At her house.

2. **Julia's Actions:**
   - She noticed that she was out of plastic spoons.
   - So, she bought a new package of spoons.

3. **Later Events:**
   - Her husband bought another package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
   - While Julia was making the stew, she used three spoons for sampling.

4. **Final Count:**
   - After using some spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of spoons initially bought by Julia (before noticing she was out).
- \( y \) as the number of spoons given by her husband after buying more.

From the information provided, we can establish the following equations based on the total number of spoons available later:

\[
x + y = 12 \quad \text{(since 12 spoons were found)}
\]

And from the earlier steps:

\[
x - 3 = y \quad \text{because 3 spoons were used for tasting}
\]

Now, substitute \( y \) from the second equation into the first:

\[
x - 3 = x - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 6

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chicken sausages and fish sausages Dylan needs to buy for his party.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of chicken sausages:**
   - According to the problem, Dylan buys 38 chicken sausages.
   
2. **Calculate the number of fish sausages:**
   - The problem states that Dylan buys 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages.
   - Since he has already bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish sausages} = 38 + 6 = 44

   - Amy made 20 more friends than Lily.
   - Lily made 50 friends.

2. **Determine how many friends Amy made:**
   - Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, we can calculate Amy's number of friends as follows:
     \[
     \text{Amy's friends} = \text{Lily's friends} + 20
     \]
     Substituting the value for Lily's friends:
     \[
     \text{Amy's friends} = 50 + 20 = 70

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the Cost of Each Item
First, let's establish the cost relationships based on the given information.

- Let \( P \) represent the cost of one pepper.
- According to the problem, \( P = \$15 \).

Now we can calculate the costs for other items using this base value.

#### Watermelon Cost Calculation
- The problem states that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
\[ \text{Watermelon cost} = 3 \times P \]
Substitute \( P = \$15 \):
\[ \text{Watermelon cost} = 3 \times 15 = \$45 \]

#### Orange Cost Calculation
- The orange costs five dollars less than what a watermelon costs.
\[ \text{Orange cost} = \text{Watermelon cost} - 5 \]
Substitute the watermelon cost:
\[ \text{Orange cost} = 45 - 5 = \$40 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Amount of Money Spent
Dillon buys:
- 4 watermelons,
- 20 peppers,
- 10 oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each item.

#### Watermelon Costs
- Number of watermelons: 4
- Cost per watermelon: \$45
\[ \text{Total cost of watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = \$180 \]

#### Pepper Costs
- Number of peppers: 20
- Cost per pepper: \$15
\[ \text{Total cost of peppers} = 20 \times 15 = \$300 \]

#### Orange Costs
- Number of oranges: 10
- Cost per orange: \$40
\[ \text{Total cost of oranges} = 10 \times 40 = \$400 \]

### Step 3: Sum Up All Costs
Finally, let's add up all these amounts to find out how much money Dillon spends in total.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of watermelons} + \text{Cost of peppers} + \text{Cost of oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$180 + \$300 + \$400 = \$980
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **\$980**.<|im_end|>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on all appointments.
Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes per appointment. There are 500 patients per day. First, convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ \text{Total time in minutes} = 500 \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{60} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[
\text{Total time in minutes} = 500 \times 24 = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{12000}{60} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the total time spent on all appointments is **200 hours**.

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue generated by the doctors' fee.
Each doctor charges $150 per hour. With 200 hours of work, the total earnings from the doctors can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Revenue from doctors} = 200 \times 150 = \$30,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost incurred by the hospital.
The hospital charges $200 per hour for its services. Since there are 200 hours of service provided:

\[
\text{Cost to the hospital} = 200 \times 200 = \$40,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the hospital's profit.
Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the revenue. Thus,

\[
\text{Hospital Profit} = \text{Revenue from Doctors} - \text{Hospital Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Hospital Profit} = 30,000 - 40,000 = -\$10,000
\]

Therefore, the hospital incurs a loss of **$10,000** from these visits. 

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} The hospital makes a loss of **$10,000** from these visits.<|im_end|>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day

They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of elves who quit initially.
Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. According to the problem, one-third of these elves quit because children vomited on them.

\[
\text{Number of elves who quit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, 20 elves quit due to vomiting.

### Step 2: Determine how many elves remain after some quit due to vomiting.
After 20 elves quit due to vomiting, we need to subtract that number from the total hired:

\[
\text{Remaining elves after vomiting} = 60 - 20 = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kicked their shins.
According to the problem, out of the remaining 40 elves, 10 quit after kids kicked their shins.

### Step 4: Determine how many elves are left after both groups quit.
Subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked (10) from the remaining elves after vomiting:

\[
\text{Total elves left} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
2. Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
3. They both rode the luge 2 times.

Let's calculate the total number of rides for each person:

- For Pam: 
  - Roller Coaster (2 rides) + Luge (2 rides) = 4 rides in total.

- For Fred: 
  - Roller Coaster (4 rides) + Luge (2 rides) = 6 rides in total.

Now, we know that each ride costs 6 tickets. Let's calculate the total number of tickets used by Pam and Fred:

- Pam's tickets: \( 4 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets per ride} = 24 \text{ tickets} \).

- Fred's tickets: \( 6 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ tickets per ride} = 36 \text{ tickets} \).

Finally, we add up the tickets used by both Pam and Fred:

- Total tickets used: \( 24 \text{ tickets} + 36 \text{ tickets} = 60 \text{ tickets} \).

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: 60 tickets.<|im_end|>","The total times that they ride the roller coaster is 2+4=<<2+4=6>>6 times.
The total times that they ride the luge is 2+2=<<2+2=4>>4 times.

                    question:
                    On Monday, Walt walked , 4 miles. Tuesday, , he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday. His : total mileage ! Monday through ? Wednesday was : 41 miles. : How many miles : did he , walk . on Wednesday?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many miles Walt walked on Monday.
Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.

### Step 2: Calculate how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
According to the problem, Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. 
- Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, we multiply that amount by 6 to find out how much he walked on Tuesday.
\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 4 \times 6 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Miles on Tuesday} = 24 \]

### Step 3: Sum up the total miles for Monday and Tuesday.
We add the miles from both days to get the total miles walked in those two days.
\[ \text{Total Miles (Monday + Tuesday)} = 4 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total Miles (Monday + Tuesday)} = 28 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total miles walked in Monday and Tuesday from the given total miles for all three days.
We know that the total miles for all three days is 41 miles.
So, let’s subtract the total miles for Monday and Tuesday from the overall total:
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Miles on Wednesday} = 13 \]

Therefore, Walt walked **13 miles** on Wednesday.

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate monthly cost**
Tom gets 4 car washes per month.

Cost per car wash = $15

Number of car washes per month = 4

Monthly cost = Cost per car wash × Number of car washes per month
             = $15 × 4
             = $60

So far, Tom has spent $60 on car washes in a month.

**Step 2: Calculate yearly cost**
There are 12 months in a year.

Yearly cost = Monthly cost × Number of months in a year
            = $60 × 12
            = $720

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many video games Brian has:**
   - We know from the problem statement that Brian has 20 video games.

2. **Calculate three times the number of video games Brian has:**
   - Since Brian has 20 video games, we calculate three times this amount.
     \[
     3 \times 20 = 60
     \]

3. **Subtract five from the result to find out how many video games Bobby has:**
   - Bobby has 5 fewer than what three times the number of video games Brian has.
     \[
     60 - 5 = 55
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, Bobby has 55 video games.

2. Calculate how many of those unicorns are female.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine the number of unicorns in Scotland

We know that one-third of all unicorns are in Scotland. Given that there are 27 unicorns in total, we can calculate the number of unicorns in Scotland as follows:

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in Scotland} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27
\]

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in Scotland} = 9
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns

We're told that two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female. Since we've determined that there are 9 unicorns in Scotland, we can now find out how many of these are female:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
\]

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = 6

To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to calculate the individual costs of the items she ordered and then apply any applicable fees or discounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the sub orders.
Rory orders 2 subs, each costing $7.50.
\[ \text{Cost of subs} = 2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the bag of chips.
Rory buys 2 bags of chips, each costing $1.50.
\[ \text{Cost of chips} = 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the cookies.
Rory buys 2 cookies, each costing $1.00.
\[ \text{Cost of cookies} = 2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00 \]

#### Step 4: Sum up all item costs.
\[ \text{Total item cost} = \$15.00 (\text{subs}) + \$3.00 (\text{chips}) + \$2.00 (\text{cookies}) \]
\[ \text{Total item cost} = \$20.00 \]

#### Step 5: Apply the delivery fee (20%).
\[ \text{Delivery fee} = 20\% \times \$20.00 = 0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00 \]

#### Step 6: Add the tip.
Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip on top of the delivered order.
\[ \text{Tip} = \$5.00 \]

#### Step 7: Calculate the total order cost.
\[ \text{Total order cost} = \text{Total item cost} + \text{Delivery fee} + \text{Tip} \]
\[ \text{Total order cost} = \$20.00 + \$4.00 + \$5.00 \]
\[ \text{Total order cost} = \$29.00 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$29.00}

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in his first test.
- The total number of questions in the first test is 75.
- Mark completes the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.

First, we need to determine how long it takes Mark to complete the first test.
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Questions}}{\text{Questions per Hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75}{5} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in 15 hours:
\[ \text{Number of Questions} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Number of Questions} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

So, Mark completes all 75 questions in the first test within 15 hours.

### Step 2: Determine how many questions Mark leaves incomplete after completing the first test.
Since Mark completes all 75 questions in the first test, there are no questions left incomplete for the first test.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in his second test.
- The total number of questions in the second test is 100.
- Mark continues to work at the same rate (5 questions per hour).

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Mark to complete the second test.
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Questions}}{\text{Questions per Hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in 20 hours:
\[ \text{Number of Questions} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Number of Questions} = 5 \times 20 = 100 \]

So, Mark completes all 100 questions in the second test within 20 hours.

### Step 4: Determine how many questions Mark leaves incomplete after completing the second test.
Since Mark completes both tests without any questions left incomplete, the final answer is:

### Step 1: Identify the Total Number of Cars
There are 20 available cars in total.

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Semi-Automatic Cars
We know that there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars.
Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage of Semi-Automatic Cars
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substitute the numbers we found:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

### Conclusion
The percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is \(20\%\). Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Total number of bees = 700
   - Worker bees > Baby bees > Queens (in terms of quantity)

2. **Define variables:**
   Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
   Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.

3. **Set up equations based on the relationships:**
   - Since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
     \[
     W = 2B
     \]
   - And since there are twice as many baby bees as queens:
     \[
     B = 2Q
     \]

4. **Express everything in terms of \( Q \):**
   From \( B = 2Q \), we can express \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2Q
   \]
   Substitute \( B \) back into the equation for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 2(2Q) = 4Q
   \]

5. **Substitute both expressions for \( B \) and \( W \) into the total bee count equation:**
   The total number of bees is 700, so:
   \[
   W + B + Q = 700
   \]
   Substituting \( W = 4Q \) and \( B = 2Q \):
   \[
   4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
   \]

6. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   7Q = 700
   \]
   Divide both sides by 7:
   \[
   Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
   \]

7. **Calculate the number of baby bees \( B \):**
   Using \( B = 2Q \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

8. **Calculate the number of worker bees \( W \):**
   Using \( W = 4Q \):
   \[
   W = 4 \times 100 = 400

                    question:
                    Jordan ; plays video games for 2 hours every day. He also has a ? part-time job where , he earns $10 . an hour. How much : money would , Jordan earn in . one week ! if he ! spent ; his video game time working ? instead?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Jordan's daily earnings from playing video games.
Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day.

Step 1a: Determine how much Jordan earns per hour from playing video games.
- If we assume that Jordan earns $10 per hour from playing video games (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise), then his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hours Playing Video Games} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Daily Earnings} = 2 \, \text{hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$20 \text{ per day}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jordan's weekly earnings from playing video games.
Assuming there are 7 days in a week:

Step 2a: Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week.
\[
\text{Weekly Earnings from Video Games} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly Earnings from Video Games} = \$20 \times 7 = \$140 \text{ per week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Jordan's weekly earnings from his part-time job.
Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job.

Step 3a: Determine how many hours Jordan works in a week to maximize his earnings from his part-time job.
Since the total number of hours Jordan plays video games in a week is limited, we need to consider only the maximum possible hours he could work in a week. Assuming he works full-time or close to it:

Step 3b: Calculate the total amount Jordan earns from his part-time job in a week.
\[
\text{Weekly Earnings from Part-Time Job} = \text{Hours Working per Week} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
\]
Let's assume Jordan works all 24 hours of the week:
\[
\text{Weekly Earnings from Part-Time Job} = 24 \, \text{hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$240 \text{ per week}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the net difference between his earnings from both jobs.
Now, we calculate the net difference between his earnings from his part-time job and his earnings from playing video games.

Step 4a: Subtract the weekly earnings from video games from the weekly earnings from his part-time job.
\[
\text{Net Difference} = \text{Weekly Earnings from Part-Time Job} - \text{Weekly Earnings from Video Games}
\]
\[
\text{Net Difference} = \$240 - \$140 = \$100
\]

### Conclusion:
By spending his video game time working at his part-time job, Jordan would earn \$100 more than what he currently earns from playing video games in a single week.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: \( \boxed{\$100} \)<|im_end|>","Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day x 7 days in a week = <<2*7=14>>14 hours a week.
If Jordan spent his 14 hours working instead, he would make 14 hours x $10 = $<<14*10=140>>140.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of food items only.
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light Bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 = $11

### Step 2: Identify non-food items that will be taxed at 10%.

- Roach traps: $4 (This item does not have a tax because it's not considered non-food)

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost before taxes.

Total cost before taxes = Food items + Non-food items
= $11 + $4
= $15

### Step 4: Apply the 10% tax rate to the non-food items.

Tax amount = Total cost before taxes * Tax rate
= $15 * 10%
= $1.5

### Step 5: Add the tax amount to the total cost before taxes.

Final total cost = Total cost before taxes + Tax amount
= $15 + $1.5
= $16.5

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} $16.5<|im_end|>","The foodstuff cost 2+3=$<<2+3=5>>5

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of clients**: 
   - Currently, Kim has 3 clients.
   - He is considering adding another 5 potential clients.
   - Total number of clients = 3 (current) + 5 (potential) = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the total number of items needed**:
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - Total bottles of bleach per client = 2 bottles.
   - Total packs of cloths per client = 1 pack.
   - Total items for all clients = 8 clients * (2 bottles + 1 pack) = 8 * 3 = 24 items.

3. **Calculate the cost of supplies**:
   - Cost of one bottle of bleach = $2.
   - Cost of one pack of cloths = $5.
   - Total cost of bottles of bleach = 24 bottles * $2/bottle = $48.
   - Total cost of packs of cloths = 24 packs * $5/pack = $120.
   - Total expenses = $48 (bleach) + $120 (cloths) = $168.

4. **Calculate the total income**:
   - Total income per week = $92.

5. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $168 = -$76.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is -$76. This means that Kim will incur a loss of $76 each week.<|im_end|>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pineapples in the field.

John has 10 hectares of land. Each hectare contains 100 pineapples.
- Number of pineapples per hectare = 100
- Total number of hectares = 10

Therefore, the total number of pineapples in the field is:
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = \text{Number of hectares} \times \text{Pineapples per hectare} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 10 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 1000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how often John can harvest his pineapples.

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

### Step 3: Determine how many harvests John can make in one year.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to calculate how many times John can harvest his pineapples in that time frame.

To do this, divide the total number of months in a year by the frequency of harvests:
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{\text{Total months in a year}}{\text{Frequency of harvests per year}} \]
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = 4 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.

Now that we know John can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples in the field by the number of harvests he can perform in a year.

\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = \text{Total pineapples} \times \text{Number of harvests per year} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = 1000 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = 4000 \]

### Final Answer:
John can harvest a total of **4000** pineapples within a year.<|im_end|>","John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Lego bricks Johnny has in total after picking them up from different floors.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of pieces in the first Lego box.
Johnny picked up one Lego box containing 500 pieces.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the second Lego box.
The second box contains 3 times as many pieces as the first box. Therefore,
\[ \text{Number of pieces in the second box} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces in the third Lego box.
The third box contains \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of pieces in the first box. Therefore,
\[ \text{Number of pieces in the third box} = \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picked up.
Now, let's add up all the pieces:
\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = 500 + 1500 + 125 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = 2125 \]

Therefore, Johnny picks up **2125** Lego pieces in total.<|im_end|>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Bee Count**:
   - At the start (before any bees have left or arrived), there are no bees in the hive.

2. **Bee Departures**:
   - In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
   
3. **Bee Returns**:
   - In the next 6 hours, half of those 30 bees return to the hive. So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of bees returning} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
     \]

4. **Total Bees Remaining After First Cycle**:
   - Initially, there were no bees; after 30 bees leave, there are 0 bees remaining.
   - Adding back the 15 bees that return:
     \[
     \text{Bees remaining after first cycle} = 0 + 15 = 15
     \]

5. **Second Bee Departure**:
   - The number of bees leaving remains the same at 30.

6. **Bee Returns for Second Cycle**:
   - Now, there are again 15 bees remaining in the hive. During this 6-hour period, half of these 15 bees will return.
     \[
     \text{Number of bees returning} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
     \]
   Since bees can only return whole numbers, we round it to the nearest whole number, which is 8.

7. **Total Bees Remaining After Second Cycle**:
   - Add the 8 bees that return during this second cycle:
     \[
     \text{Bees remaining after second cycle} = 15 + 8 = 23
     \]

Therefore, the total number of bees that returned to the hive over the course of the entire day is **23**.<|im_end|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( C \) be the amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier.
- Let \( A \) be the number of adult tickets bought.
- Let \( C \) (children) be the number of children tickets bought.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
1. **Adult Tickets Cost**: 
   - Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - There are 1 adult tickets bought, so the total cost for adult tickets is \( 12A \).

2. **Child Tickets Cost**:
   - Each child ticket costs $10.
   - There are \( C \) child tickets bought, so the total cost for child tickets is \( 10C \).

3. **Total Admission Cost**:
   - The total admission cost is the sum of the cost of adult tickets and child tickets, which equals \( 12A + 10C \).

4. **Change Received**:
   - Brittany's mom receives $8 in change from the total amount given.

5. **Amount Given to Cashier**:
   - Brittany's mom gave the cashier \( C \) dollars.

6. **Relationship Between Amount Given and Change**:
   - Since the cashier returned $8 as change, we can write the equation: 
     \[
     C = X + 8
     \]
     where \( X \) is the amount Brittany's mom actually gave to the cashier.

### Step 3: Solve for the Total Admission Cost
Let's assume Brittany's mom bought one adult ticket and one child ticket. This means:
\[
A = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad C = 1
\]

Substituting these values into the total admission cost equation:
\[
12(1) + 10(1) = 12 + 10 = 22
\]

So, the total admission cost is $22.

### Step 4: Calculate the Amount Given to the Cashier
Since Brittany's mom gave the cashier \( C \) dollars and received $8 in change, the amount given must cover the total cost minus the change:
\[
C = 22 - 8 = 14
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]<|im_end|>","The total cost of the tickets is 12+10=<<12+10=22>>22 dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has based on the information given about Charlie's number of friends.

Step 1: Determine Charlie's number of Facebook friends.
Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We know that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.

\[ \text{Charlie's Facebook friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's Facebook friends} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Charlie's Facebook friends} = 12 \]

Let \( D \) represent Dorothy's number of Facebook friends.

From the equation:
\[ 12 = 3 \times D \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Step 2: Determine James' number of Facebook friends.
James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.

\[ \text{James' Facebook friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's Facebook friends} \]

Since Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends:

\[ \text{James' Facebook friends} = 4 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{James' Facebook friends} = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

                    question:
                    Shawnda decides ? that her neighborhood kids ! could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge ! is ; by the : tire. Each tire ! costs 25 ? cents to ; inflate. On the first day, 5 : people : on ! bicycles came by ; to get both tires ; inflated. 3 : people came by to get . all their tricycle . tires ; inflated.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Shawnda made from inflating tires, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tires inflated.
2. Determine the cost per tire.
3. Multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire to find the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated**

- For bicycles: 
  - Each bicycle has two tires.
  - There were 5 bicycles.
  - Total bikes = 5
  - Total tires for bikes = 5 * 2 = 10 tires

- For tricycles:
  - Each tricycle has three tires.
  - There were 3 tricycles.
  - Total tricycles = 3
  - Total tires for tricycles = 3 * 3 = 9 tires

- For unicycles:
  - Each unicycle has one tire.
  - There was 1 unicycle.
  - Total unicycles = 1
  - Total tires for unicycles = 1 * 1 = 1 tire

Total tires inflated = Tires for bicycles + Tires for tricycles + Tires for unicycles
= 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle)
= 20 tires

**Step 2: Determine the cost per tire**
- Cost to inflate one tire = $0.25

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue**
- Total revenue = Number of tires * Cost per tire
- Total revenue = 20 tires * $0.25/tire
- Total revenue = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day. 

{The final answer is} The final answer is $5.00.<|im_end|>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Carl bought.
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies. Each pack contains 6 cookies.

\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Each cookie costs $0.10.

\[ \text{Cost per cookie} = \$0.10 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for all cookies} = 60 \times \$0.10 \]

First calculate \(60 \times 0.10\):

\[ 60 \times 0.10 = 6 \]

So, the total cost for all the cookies is:

\[ \$6 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount Carl receives in change after paying with a $10 bill.
Carl pays with a $10 bill.

\[ \text{Amount paid} = \$10 \]
\[ \text{Change received} = \$10 - \$6 \]

Subtracting these amounts gives us:

\[ \$10 - \$6 = \$4 \]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:

\[ The final answer is: \$4 \]<|im_end|>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.
Thus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.
Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and work through it step-by-step.

1. **Initial Pack Size**:
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of French fries in the initial pack.
   
2. **Dave’s Consumption**:
   - Dave eats 14 French fries.
   
3. **Seagull’s Theft**:
   - The seagull steals half of what Dave has eaten.
     - Seagull steals: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) fries.
   
4. **Remaining After Seagull**:
   - Remaining after seagull: \( x - 7 \).
   
5. **Pigeon's Bullying**:
   - Three pigeons bully Dave and eat three fries each.
     - Pigeons eat: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
   
6. **Remaining After Pigeons**:
   - Remaining after pigeons: \( (x - 7) - 9 = x - 16 \).

7. **Raccoon’s Theft**:
   - A raccoon steals two-thirds of the remaining fries.
     - Raccoon steals: \( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 16) \).
     
8. **Final Amount Left**:
   - Five fries are left.
   
9. **Calculating the Initial Pack Size**:
   - From the final state, we know there are 5 fries left.
   - So, \( (x - 16) - \left( \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 16) \right) = 5 \).
   
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   - \( (x - 16) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 16) = 5 \).
   
   Distribute the fraction:
   - \( x - 16 - \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{32}{3} = 5 \).
   
   Combine like terms:
   - \( x - \frac{2}{3}x - 16 + \frac{32}{3} = 5 \).
   
   Factor out \( x \):
   - \( \frac{1}{3}x - \frac{32}{3} = 5 \).
   
   Add 16 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   - \( \frac{1}{3}x = 21 \).
   
   Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   - \( x = 63 \).

Therefore, the total number of French fries in the pack when Dave bought it was **63**.<|im_end|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate his total class time for both days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday; Tuesday, Thursday) over the entire period.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Class Time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**
   - Days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
   - Classes per day: 3
   - Duration per class: 1 hour
   - Total hours per day: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
   - Number of days in a week: 5 (since it's not specified, assume full weeks)
   - Weeks in a semester: 16
   - Total hours per semester on these days: \(3 \times 5 \times 16 = 240\) hours

2. **Calculate Class Time on Tuesday and Thursday:**
   - Days: Tuesday, Thursday
   - Classes per day: 2
   - Duration per class: 2 hours
   - Total hours per day: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours
   - Number of days in a week: 5
   - Weeks in a semester: 16
   - Total hours per semester on these days: \(4 \times 5 \times 16 = 320\) hours

3. **Sum Up the Total Hours:**
   - Total hours spent on Monday, Wednesday, Friday + Tuesday, Thursday = \(240 + 320 = 560\) hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
{The final answer is} 560 hours.<|im_end|>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the baked goods when stacked end-to-end. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Length of Each Type of Baked Good
- **Rolls**: 
  - Number of rolls per day = 120
  - Length of each roll = 4 inches
  - Total length of rolls = \(120 \times 4\) inches

\[
Total \; length \; of \; rolls = 480 \text{ inches}
\]

- **Croissants**:
  - Number of croissants per day = 300
  - Length of each croissant = 6 inches
  - Total length of croissants = \(300 \times 6\) inches

\[
Total \; length \; of \; croissants = 1800 \text{ inches}
\]

- **Baguettes**:
  - Number of baguettes per day = 60
  - Length of each baguette = 2 feet
  - Since there are 12 inches in a foot,
    - Length of each baguette = \(2 \times 12\) inches

\[
Length \; of \; each \; baguette = 24 \text{ inches}
\]
  
- **Total Length Calculation**:
  - Sum up the lengths of all types of baked goods.

\[
Total \; length \; = 480 + 1800 + (60 \times 24)
\]

### Step 2: Perform the Multiplication for Baguettes
- Number of baguettes per day = 60
- Length of each baguette = 24 inches

\[
Total \; length \; of \; baguettes = 60 \times 24
\]

\[
Total \; length \; of \; baguettes = 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Add Up All Lengths
- Roll length: 480 inches
- Croissant length: 1800 inches
- Baguette length: 1440 inches

\[
Total \; length \; = 480 + 1800 + 1440
\]

\[
Total \; length \; = 3720 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Convert Total Inches to Feet
- There are 12 inches in one foot.

\[
Total \; length \; in \; feet = \frac{3720}{12}
\]

\[
Total \; length \; in \; feet = 310 \text{ feet}
\]

### Conclusion
Bill’s baked goods will be a total length of 310 feet if stacked end-to-end.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 310.<|im_end|>","First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches

Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet
Then find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet

To determine the total number of bananas needed over two months, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas needed per month.
- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month

Total bananas per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas/month

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months.
Total bananas for 2 months = 700 × 2 = 1400 bananas

### Step 3: Determine if the zookeeper has enough bananas ordered.
From the information provided, it's stated that the zookeeper orders bananas from a local farm ""every 2 months"". This means he orders bananas at the end of each 2-month period.

Since the zookeeper orders bananas only once every 2 months, he would have exactly enough bananas for the first 2 months when he orders them at the end of the second 2-month period.

Therefore, no additional ordering is required because the zookeeper already has sufficient bananas for the 2 months.

### Conclusion:
The zookeeper needs to order **no additional bananas** for the 2 months as his current order covers the entire period.

{The final answer is} 0 bananas.<|im_end|>","The total number of bananas the prime apes need every month is 200+400+100= <<200+400+100=700>>700.

Blake: 
Kelly:
Step 1: Determine how many laps Blake completes.
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each lap is half the length of the football field.
- The football field is 100 yards long.

Calculation for Blake's distance:
\[ \text{Distance per lap} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Total distance for 15 laps} = 15 \times 50 = 750 \text{ yards} \]

Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total distance based on her actions.
- Kelly runs from the 40-yard line to the 80-yard line (backwards) once.
- Then she runs from the 80-yard line back to the 40-yard line (forward).

Calculation for Kelly's first segment:
\[ \text{Distance from 40-yard line to 80-yard line} = 40 \text{ yards} \]

Calculation for Kelly's second segment:
\[ \text{Distance from 80-yard line to 40-yard line} = 40 \text{ yards} \]

Total distance for Kelly:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ yards} \]

Step 3: Compare distances and determine who wins.
- The winner runs further if their distance exceeds the other runner’s distance.

Comparison:
- Blake: 750 yards
- Kelly: 80 yards

Since 750 yards > 80 yards:

Final Answer: **The winner runs 750 yards more than the loser**.<|im_end|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

                    question:
                    Raphael went to buy some school ! supplies. He bought 4 pens which cost : $1.5 each, ; 2 notebooks which ; cost $4 each, . and ; a ; rim of ! bond paper , which cost $20. How much did ! Raphael : spend on everything?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To find out how much Raphael spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item he purchased and then sum these costs.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the pens.
Raphael bought 4 pens at $1.5 each.
Cost of pens = Number of pens × Cost per pen
             = 4 × $1.5
             = $6

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the notebooks.
Raphael bought 2 notebooks at $4 each.
Cost of notebooks = Number of notebooks × Cost per notebook
                  = 2 × $4
                  = $8

Step 3: The cost of the rim of bond paper is given as $20.

Step 4: Add up all the costs to get the total amount spent.
Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of rim of bond paper
           = $6 + $8 + $20
           = $34

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: Raphael spent $34 on everything.<|im_end|>","Raphael spent 4 x $1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6>>6 for the pens.
He also spent 2 x $4 = $<<2*4=8>>8 for the notebooks.
Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $6 + $8 + $20 = $<<6+8+20=34>>34 for the school supplies.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.

2. **Tadpoles Appearing**: Suddenly, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding.
   - After seeing these 6, Finn still has 5 tadpoles (the original 11 minus the 6 that came out) plus the 6 new ones, which totals to 11 tadpoles.

3. **Tadpoles Going Back Undercover**: Then, 2 more tadpoles hide under a rock.
   - Now, we need to determine how many tadpoles are left in the pond after accounting for those that went back under cover.

4. **Calculating Remaining Tadpoles**:
   - We start with 11 tadpoles.
   - Subtract the 2 that went back under the rock: \(11 - 2 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can still see in the pond is 9.

{The final answer is} The final answer is 9.<|im_end|>","When the hidden tadpoles come out, Finn sees 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 tadpoles swimming.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial depth of water on Tuesday.
- The tank had 7 feet more water on Tuesday than on Monday.
- We know that on Monday, the depth of water was 17 feet.

So, the depth of water on Tuesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \text{Depth on Monday} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the depth of water on Wednesday.
- On Wednesday, the depth of the water was two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
- From Step 1, we found that the depth on Tuesday was 24 feet.

So, the depth of water on Wednesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Depth on Tuesday} \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{48}{3} \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fish each person was able to catch based on their observations.

Step 1: Determine the number of starfish caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish.

Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin.
Therefore, Locsin caught \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) starfish.

Step 2: Determine the number of sea horses caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses.

Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin.
Therefore, Locsin caught \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) sea horses.

Step 3: Determine the number of clownfish caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish.

Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin.
Therefore, Locsin caught \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) clownfish.

Step 4: Sum up all the fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Anakin's total catch = Starfish (10) + Sea Horses (6) + Clownfish (3) = 19 fish.
Locsin's total catch = Starfish (5) + Sea Horses (3) + Clownfish (5) = 13 fish.

Step 5: Calculate the combined total catch.
Total catch = Anakin's total catch + Locsin's total catch = 19 + 13 = 32 fish.

Final Answer: The final answer is 32 fish.<|im_end|>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.

They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost of the marbles bag after 36 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial cost**: The initial cost of the marbles bag is given as $20.

2. **Calculate the increase in price**:
   - The price increases by 20% every two months.
   - Since there are 18 periods (three six-month intervals) within 36 months, we need to calculate the price for each period.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \). Here, \( P = \$20 \).

3. **Calculate the price after one period (two months)**:
   - After the first two months, the new price is \( P + 0.2P = 1.2P \).
   - Substituting \( P = \$20 \):
     \[
     \text{New Price} = 1.2 \times 20 = \$24
     \]

4. **Calculate the price after another period (another two months)**:
   - After the next two months (four months total), the new price becomes \( 1.2 \times \text{new price} \).
   - Substitute the new price from the previous calculation:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = 1.2 \times 24 = \$28.80
     \]

5. **Continue this process until 36 months have passed**:
   - We repeat the above calculations at each two-month interval.
   
   - At the end of four months: $28.80.
   - At the end of six months: \( 1.2 \times 28.80 = \$34.56 \).
   - At the end of eight months: \( 1.2 \times 34.56 = \$41.47 \).
   - Continue this process up to three times over the remaining 32 months.

6. **Summarize the results**:
   - By continuing this iterative process, you will eventually reach an approximate value around 36 months.

After performing these calculations iteratively, the final price should stabilize around $59.04 after approximately 36 months.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: \$59.04.<|im_end|>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4

To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the dolls and then calculate their total worth based on the given information.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let's denote the cost of one action figure as \( A \) dollars.
   - Since one doll costs as much as three action figures, the doll costs \( 3A \) dollars.
   - One red car costs $4 (as per the problem statement).

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   According to the problem, one doll costs $5 more than two action figures because it costs as much as one red car and two action figures. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   3A + 2A = 5
   \]
   Simplify this equation:
   \[
   5A = 5
   \]
   Solving for \( A \):
   \[
   A = 1
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost of Each Toy:**
   - Action figures: \( A = 1 \) dollar.
   - Doll: \( 3A = 3 \times 1 = 3 \) dollars.
   - Red Car: $4.

4. **Sum the Costs of All Toys:**
   - Number of action figures: 3
   - Number of dolls: 1
   - Number of red cars: 5

   Calculate the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (3 \times 1) + (1 \times 3) + (5 \times 4)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 + 3 + 20 = 26
   \]

### Conclusion:
The total worth of all the toys in the room is $26. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}
\]<|im_end|>","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in earnings between doing the taxes herself and hiring an accountant.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total lost earnings from not doing taxes herself:**
   - Jackie loses $35 per hour for 3 fewer hours of freelance work.
   - Total lost earnings = $35/hour × 3 hours = $105.

2. **Calculate the total cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

3. **Determine how much more money Jackie will save by hiring the accountant:**
   - Subtract the accountant's fee from the total lost earnings.
   - Savings = Lost Earnings ($105) - Accountant Fee ($90).
   - Savings = $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will save $15 more by hiring the accountant instead of doing the taxes herself.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of eggs needed**

Sandra needs 3 eggs per Spanish flan.

She plans to make 15 Spanish flans.
Therefore, the total number of eggs required = 3 eggs/flan * 15 flans = 45 eggs.

**Step 2: Calculate how many baskets Sandra uses**

Each basket contains 9 eggs.

We need a total of 45 eggs.
So, the number of baskets needed = Total eggs / Eggs per basket = 45 eggs / 9 eggs/basket = 5 baskets.

**Step 3: Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit**

Since Sandra uses one basket (which holds 9 eggs) when she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in one basket to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit.

Number of times Sandra needs to babysit = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per basket = 45 eggs / 9 eggs/basket = 5 times.

   Substitute \( S = 2B \) into the equation:
   \[
   (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]

6. **Find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):**
   Since \( B = 8 \):
   \[
   S = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   Seth is currently 16 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much Pancho walks during the weekdays**
- We know that Pancho walks 20 miles per day.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
- So, for the weekdays, his total walking distance is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Weekday Walking Distance} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Weekday Walking Distance} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ miles} \]

So, during the weekdays, Pancho walks 100 miles.

**Step 2: Determine how much Pancho walks during the weekend**
- On weekends, Pancho walks 10 miles per day.
- There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Weekend Walking Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Weekend Walking Distance} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, during the weekend, Pancho walks 20 miles.

**Step 3: Calculate the total weekly walking distance**
- Now, we add up the weekday and weekend distances to find out how far Pancho walks in a week.

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Total Weekly Walking Distance} = \text{Weekday Walking Distance} + \text{Weekend Walking Distance} \]
\[ \text{Total Weekly Walking Distance} = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Total Weekly Walking Distance} = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is **120 miles**.<|im_end|>","He walks 100 miles during the weekdays because 5 x 20 = <<5*20=100>>100

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each component in the uniform and then find the total cost of one uniform.

1. **Calculate the cost of the jacket:**
   - Given that the jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Hat = $25
   - Jacket = 3 * Hat
     \[
     \text{Jacket} = 3 \times 25 = \$75
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the pants:**
   - Pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   - Average = (Hat + Jacket) / 2
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2}
       \]
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
     \]

3. **Sum up all components to get the total cost of one uniform:**
   - Hat = $25
   - Jacket = $75
   - Pants = $50
   - Total cost = Hat + Jacket + Pants
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 = \$150

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the spiders, insects, and the rare mutant invertebrates that Jake sees.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Spiders:
Jake sees 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs.
\[
\text{Total legs from spiders} = 80 \times 8 = 640
\]

#### Insects:
Jake sees 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.
\[
\text{Total legs from insects} = 90 \times 6 = 540
\]

#### Rare Mutant Invertebrates:
Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each has 10 legs.
\[
\text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates} = 3 \times 10 = 30
\]

#### Total Legs:
Now, we sum up all the legs from the spiders, insects, and rare mutant invertebrates.
\[
\text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210
\]

Therefore, Jake sees a total of **1210** legs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all four birds based on the given information.

1. **Determine Granny Red's Age:**
   - We know that Sally Four (32) is twice as old as Granny Red.
   - Let \( R \) represent Granny Red’s age.
   - Therefore, \( 32 = 2R \).
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{32}{2} = 16
     \]
   So, Granny Red is 16 years old.

2. **Determine Sally Two's Age:**
   - Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   - Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_2 = 16 + 3 = 19
     \]

3. **Determine Sally Three's Age:**
   - Sally Three is three years younger than Sally Two.
   - Sally Two is 19 years old, so:
     \[
     S_3 = 19 - 3 = 16
     \]

4. **Verify Sally Four's Age:**
   - The problem states that Sally Four is 32 years old, which matches our earlier calculation.

5. **Calculate the Total Age of All Four Birds:**
   - Adding up the ages of all four birds gives us:
     \[
     S_2 + S_3 + S_4 + R = 19 + 16 + 32 + 16 = 83
     \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is \( \boxed{83} \).<|im_end|>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.

   - Credit Card: $200 per month.
   - Mortgage: $500 per month.

   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Payments} = \$300 + \$200 + \$500 = \$1000

2. **Determine the amount Jessica wants to increase her payments by (50%):**

   \[
   \text{Increase Amount} = \$1000 \times 0.50 = \$500
   \]

3. **Add this increase to the current total monthly payments to find the new total monthly payments:**

   \[
   \text{New Total Monthly Payments} = \$1000 + \$500 = \$1500
   \]

4. **Convert the annual payments from a monthly rate to an annual rate:**

   Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the monthly amount by 12.

   \[
   \text{Annual Payment} = \$1500 \times 12 = \$18000
   \]

Therefore, Jessica would pay $\boxed{18000}$ dollars annually for her debts if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.<|im_end|>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of lemons based on the information provided about their profit. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine Total Revenue from Selling Lemonade
- Each gallon of lemonade sells for \(20\) glasses at \(0.50\) dollars per glass.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 20 \times 0.50 = \$10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost
- The total cost includes both the cost of lemons and the cost of sugar.
- For each gallon, the cost of lemons is \( \$3 \).
- For each gallon, the cost of sugar is \( \$2 \).

So, the total cost for one gallon of lemonade is:
\[ \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 (\text{lemons}) + \$2 (\text{sugar}) = \$5 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Profit
- Profit is defined as the difference between revenue and cost.
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
Given that the profit is \( \$25 \), we can set up an equation to find the total cost.

Let \( x \) be the number of gallons sold.

For \( x \) gallons, the total revenue will be:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 10x \]

And the total cost will be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5x \]

Since profit equals revenue minus cost:
\[ 25 = 10x - 5x \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 25 = 5x \]

Divide both sides by \( 5 \):
\[ x = \frac{25}{5} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, they sold \( 5 \) gallons of lemonade.

### Step 4: Calculate Total Cost of Lemons
- Since they spent \( \$3 \) per gallon on lemons:
\[ \text{Total cost of lemons} = 5 \times 3 = \$15 \]

### Conclusion:
They spent \( \$15 \) on lemons.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $\boxed{\$15}$<|im_end|>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the race:**
   - There are 240 participants.

2. **Identify the number of Japanese participants:**
   - There are 80 Japanese participants.

3. **Calculate the number of Chinese participants:**
   - Total participants = Number of Asian participants + Number of Japanese participants + Number of Chinese participants.
   - Therefore, the number of Chinese participants can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of Chinese participants} = 240 - (80 + \text{Number of Chinese participants})
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation gives us:
     \[
     240 = 80 + \text{Number of Chinese participants}
     \]
   - Solving for the number of Chinese participants:
     \[

     \]

4. **Verify the information given about the number of boys on the Chinese team:**
   - We're told that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team.

5. **Calculate the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   - The total number of participants is 240, and we know there are 160 Chinese participants.
   - Therefore, the remaining participants must be either boys or girls.
   - Since we have already accounted for all the boys (60), the rest must be girls.
   - Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls on the Chinese team} = 240 - (\text{Number of Asian participants} + \text{Number of Japanese participants} + \text{Number of Chinese participants})
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls on the Chinese team} = 240 - (240 - 80) = 240 - 160 = 80
     \]

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 80.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 80.<|im_end|>","If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.
Since there were 60 boys in the Chinese team, there were 160-60 = 100 girls in the Chinese team.

Let's break down Zaid's monthly income and expenses step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Zaid's Salary
Zaid earns $6000 per month.

### Step 2: Calculate Rent Expense
Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
\[ \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = \$1500 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Car Fuel Expense
Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
\[ \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = \$2000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Expenses Before Donations
\[ \text{Total Expenses (Before Donations)} = \$1500 (\text{rent}) + \$2000 (\text{car fuel}) = \$3500 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Remaining Amount After Expenses
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$6000 - \$3500 = \$2500 \]

### Step 6: Calculate Donation
Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[ \text{Donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$2500 = \$1250 \]

### Step 7: Calculate Remaining Amount After Donating
\[ \text{Remaining Amount After Donation} = \$2500 - \$1250 = \$1250 \]

### Step 8: Calculate Money Given to Daughter
Zaid gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses.

### Step 9: Calculate Money Given to Wife
Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods.

### Step 10: Calculate Total Money Given Away
\[ \text{Money Given Away} = \$200 (\text{daughter}) + \$700 (\text{wife}) = \$900 \]

### Final Answer:
After all expenses and donations, Zaid will still have **\$1250** left in his account.<|im_end|>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

                    ! Rani ! has ? ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 , fewer , crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, ; calculate the total number of crabs : the three have ! together.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many crabs Monic has.
2. Determine how many crabs Rani has based on Monic's amount.
3. Calculate the total number of crabs for all three.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many crabs Monic has
According to the problem, Monic has fewer crabs than Bo. Since Bo has 40 crabs, let's denote Monic's crabs as \( M \).

Given that Monic has ""fewer"" crabs than Bo, we can write:
\[ M < B \]
Since \( B = 40 \), it follows that \( M < 40 \). The smallest integer value for \( M \) that satisfies this inequality is \( M = 39 \).

So, Monic has 39 crabs.

### Step 2: Determine how many crabs Rani has
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. Let's denote Rani's crabs as \( R \).

Given that Rani has ""more"" crabs than Monic, we can write:
\[ R > M \]

Since \( M = 39 \), it follows that \( R > 39 \). The smallest integer value for \( R \) that satisfies this inequality is \( R = 40 \).

So, Rani has 40 crabs.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs
Now we know the number of crabs each person has:
- Bo has 40 crabs,
- Monic has 39 crabs,
- Rani has 40 crabs.

To find the total number of crabs, we sum up their amounts:
\[
B + M + R = 40 + 39 + 40 = 119
\]

Therefore, the total number of crabs is:
\[
\boxed{119}
\]<|im_end|>","If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.

Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Lloyd earned over the course of his tutoring sessions.

**Step 1: Determine the number of hours Lloyd worked in total**

Lloyd worked 5 hours during the first week and 8 hours during the second week. To find out the total number of hours he worked, we add these two numbers together:

\[ \text{Total Hours} = 5 \text{ hours (first week)} + 8 \text{ hours (second week)} \]

\[ \text{Total Hours} = 13 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total earnings**

Lloyd earns $10 per hour. So, if he worked 13 hours in total, his total earnings would be:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Hours} \times \text{Hourly Rate} \]

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 13 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} \]

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned **\$130** for the first two weeks of tutoring.<|im_end|>","Lloyd tutored 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 hours for the first two weeks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of votes cast:**
   - The total number of students in the class is given as 80.

2. **Calculate the number of votes the winner received:**
   - According to the problem, the winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes.
   - To find out how many votes the winner got, we multiply the total number of votes (80) by \(\frac{3}{4}\):
     \[
     \text{Votes for winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4}
     \]
     Simplifying this multiplication:
     \[
     80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 60 \times 3 = 180
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of votes the loser received:**
   - Since the total number of votes must be distributed between the two candidates, and the winner already has 180 votes, the remaining votes will go to the loser.
   - Subtract the votes the winner got from the total votes:
     \[
     \text{Votes for loser} = 80 - 180
     \]
     However, this result doesn't make sense because we cannot have negative votes. This indicates that there might be an error in our initial assumption or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

4. **Re-evaluate the distribution:**
   - We need to ensure that the sum of votes for both candidates equals the total number of votes (80).
   - Given that the winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the votes, the rest should be taken care of by the loser.

5. **Correct calculation:**
   - Let \(x\) represent the number of votes the winner received.
   - Then the number of votes the loser would receive is \(80 - x\).
   - According to the problem, the winner got \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes:
     \[
     x = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
     \]
     Calculating this:
     \[
     x = 60
     \]
   - Therefore, the loser must have received the remaining votes after the winner's share:
     \[
     \text{Votes for loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
     \]

So, the number of votes the loser got is \boxed{20}.<|im_end|>","The winner got 3/4*80 = <<3/4*80=60>>60 votes.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of red roses that Fred needs to deliver before 5 PM so that Sandra can be satisfied.

1. **Calculate the number of white carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered twice the amount of white carnations as red roses.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of red roses.
   - Therefore, the number of white carnations is \( 2x \).

2. **Determine the number of pink calla lilies:**
   - The number of pink calla lilies is given as 200.
   - According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     200 = 5 \times (2x)
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     200 = 10x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{10} = 20
     \]

3. **Find the number of red roses:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of red roses, there are \( 20 \) red roses in total.

4. **Verify the conditions for switching suppliers:**
   - Sandra will threaten to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM.
   - Therefore, Fred must deliver all \( 20 \) red roses by 5 PM to avoid switching suppliers.

### Conclusion:
Fred must deliver exactly \( 20 \) red roses by 5 PM to satisfy Sandra and prevent her from threatening to switch suppliers. Thus, the final answer is:

To determine Jean's current age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - We know that Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Let \( M \) represent Mark's current age.

2. **Calculate Jean's current age based on Mark's age:**
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean’s current age can be represented as \( J = M + 2 \).

3. **Use the given information about Jan's age:**
   - We are told that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.
   - Let \( A \) represent Jan's current age.

4. **Express this relationship mathematically:**
   - Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \).
   - Half of Jan's age at that time would be \( \frac{A}{2} \).
   - According to the problem, \( M - 2 = \frac{A}{2} + 5 \).

5. **Substitute Jan's current age into the equation:**
   - Given that Jan's current age \( A = 30 \), substitute it into the equation.
     \[
     M - 2 = \frac{30}{2} + 5
     \]
     Simplify the right side:
     \[
     M - 2 = 15 + 5
     \]
     \[
     M - 2 = 20
     \]

6. **Solve for Mark's current age \( M \):**
   - Add 2 to both sides of the equation.
     \[
     M = 22
     \]

7. **Calculate Jean's current age using Mark's age:**
   - Since Jean is two years older than Mark, 
     \[
     J = M + 2
     \]
     Substitute \( M = 22 \):
     \[
     J = 22 + 2
     \]
     \[
     J = 24

<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how much time the faster team wins by, let's break down the problem into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance for both teams.
Each team runs 4 laps (400 meters per lap), so we need to calculate the total distance for both teams.

- **Faster Team**:
  - Total distance = 4 laps * 400 meters/lap = 1600 meters

- **Slower Team**:
  - First runner: 60 seconds
  - Second runner: 63 seconds (since each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster)
  - Third runner: 66 seconds
  - Fourth runner: 72 seconds

Total distance for the slower team = 60 + 63 + 66 + 72 = 251 seconds

### Step 2: Determine the difference in total distances between the two teams.
Difference in total distance = Faster team distance - Slower team distance

Difference = 1600 meters - 251 meters = 1349 meters

### Step 3: Convert the difference from meters to seconds.
Since 1 kilometer = 1000 meters and there are 3600 seconds in an hour,
\[ \text{Difference in seconds} = \frac{1349}{1000} \times 3600 \]

Calculating the above expression:

\[ \text{Difference in seconds} = 1349 \times 0.36 = 485.24 \text{ seconds} \]

### Final Answer:
The faster team wins by approximately \(485.24\) seconds.<|im_end|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to compare two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.

### Step 1: Calculate the Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3

A standard six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. The outcomes that are greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[
P(\text{number > 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \quad \text{(or 50%)}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Probability of Rolling Two Consecutive Even Numbers

First, let's identify the even numbers on a six-sided die. The even numbers are 2 and 4.

- **Probability of first roll being even**: Since there are 2 even numbers (2 and 4), there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
  
\[
P(\text{first roll is even}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

- **Probability of second roll being even given the first roll was even**: If the first roll is even, then there are still 2 favorable outcomes left for the second roll (since the first even outcome does not affect the second roll).

\[
P(\text{second roll is even | first roll is even}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities together:

\[
P(\text{two consecutive even numbers}) = P(\text{first roll is even}) \times P(\text{second roll is even | first roll is even}) = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{9}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Probabilities

Now, let's compare the two probabilities:

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \(0.5\) or \(50\%\)
- Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers: \(\frac{1}{9}\)

Convert \(\frac{1}{9}\) to a decimal for easier comparison:

\[
\frac{1}{9} \approx 0.1111
\]

So, the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is approximately \(11.11\%\).

### Conclusion

The probability that Jerry will roll a number greater than 3 is higher at \(50\%\) compared to the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, which is approximately \(11.11\%\). Therefore, it is significantly less likely for him to roll two consecutive even numbers than to roll a number greater than 3.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is The final answer is.<|im_end|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jenna and her mother picked apples.
   - Jenna picked ""half"" as many apples as her mother.
   - Her mother picked 20 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked:**
   - Since Jenna picked ""half"" as many apples as her mother, we need to calculate half of what her mother picked.
   
   \[
   \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mother's apples}
   \]
   
   Given that her mother picked 20 apples, we substitute 20 into the equation for Jenna’s apples:
   
   \[
   \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother:**
   - To find out the total number of apples picked by both, we add the number of apples picked by Jenna (10) to the number picked by her mother (20).
   
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = \text{Jenna's apples} + \text{Mother's apples}
   \]
   
   Substituting in our values:
   
   \[
   \text{Total apples} = 10 + 20 = 30

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of rats
- Total straw distributed to rats = 160 pieces.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.

Let \( R \) be the total number of rats.

\[ 6R = 160 \]

Solve for \( R \):

\[ R = \frac{160}{6} \]
\[ R = 26.67 \]

Since the number of rats must be an integer, we need to check if there was a misinterpretation or error. However, since the problem states ""There are ; 10 cages : of hamsters"", and we assume all other conditions hold, we'll proceed with this interpretation.

### Step 2: Verify the distribution of straws to hamsters
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.

Let \( H \) be the total number of hamsters.

\[ 5H = 10 \times 10 \text{ (since there are 10 cages)} \]
\[ 5H = 100 \]

Solve for \( H \):

\[ H = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ H = 20 \]

So, there are 20 hamsters.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rats per cage
- There are 26.67 rats (as calculated above).
- These rats are divided into equal groups in 3 cages.

Calculate the number of rats per cage:

\[ \text{Number of rats per cage} = \frac{26.67}{3} \]
\[ \text{Number of rats per cage} = 8.89 \]

Since the number of rats must be an integer, we round up to ensure all rats are accounted for:

\[ \text{Number of rats per cage} = 9 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount that Mandy owes Benedict including the accrued interest over three months.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly interest.
Mandy's debt per month = $100
Monthly interest rate = 2%

Interest for one month = (Debt * Monthly Interest Rate) / 100
= ($100 * 2%) / 100
= $2

Step 2: Calculate the total interest accumulated over three months.
Total interest = Interest per month * Number of months
= $2 * 3
= $6

Step 3: Add the total interest to the original debt.
Total amount owed = Original debt + Total interest
= $100 + $6
= $106

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106 in total.

The final answer is: The final answer is $106.<|im_end|>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of buying the wheat:**
   - The trader bought 1 bag of wheat for $20.
   - He made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold.
   - Each bag was sold for $30.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is \( 30x \).

3. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - The profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - The total cost includes the initial purchase of the wheat plus the transportation cost.
   - The total cost can be expressed as:
     \[
     20 + (x-1) \times 2 = 20 + 2(x-1)
     \]
     where \( x-1 \) represents the number of bags that were not bought initially, assuming he started with one bag.

4. **Simplify the total cost expression:**
   \[
   20 + 2(x-1) = 20 + 2x - 2 = 18 + 2x
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   \[
   30x - (18 + 2x) = 400
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   30x - 18 - 2x = 400
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   28x - 18 = 400
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   28x = 418
   \]
   Divide both sides by 28:
   \[
   x = \frac{418}{28} \approx 15.21
   \]
   Since the number of bags must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number because partial bags don't make sense in this context.

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \( x = 16 \):
     - Initial cost: \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \)
     - Transportation cost: \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \)
     - Total cost: \( 20 + 30 = 50 \)
     - Selling price: \( 16 \times 30 = 480 \)
     - Profit: \( 480 - 50 = 430 \)

Since the actual profit does not match the required $400, there might have been a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

Given the discrepancy, it seems there may be an error in the problem statement itself or in the interpretation of the problem. The correct approach would involve checking the logic again or providing more details about the problem. 

However, if we assume the provided values are correct, then the trader could have sold approximately 15.21 bags, but since he cannot sell a fraction of a bag, the closest whole number would be 16 bags.

Thus, the final answer should be:

\boxed{16}<|im_end|>","Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on food:**
   - The total amount spent on tickets is $20.25.
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets.
   
   Therefore, the cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on rides:**
   - They went on 2 different rides.
   - Each ride costs $33.
   
   Therefore, the total cost of rides = $33 * 2 = $66.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
   
   Therefore, the total amount spent = $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

4. **Determine how much each friend pays:**
   - There are three friends.
   
   Therefore, each person will pay = Total amount / Number of friends
   
   Therefore, each person will pay = $102 / 3 = $34.

Therefore, each friend paid $34.

{The final answer is} $34.<|im_end|>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.

They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

                    question:
                    Tom plants 10 trees a year.  Every year , he also chops ! down , 2 ? trees . a , year.  . He starts ? with 50 trees.  ! After 10 years 30% . of the . trees die.  How many trees does he have : left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Calculate how many trees Tom has after chopping some every year.
2. Determine how many trees die over time due to the percentage given in the problem.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate remaining trees after chopping

Tom starts with 50 trees and plants 10 trees per year. Each year, he chops down 2 trees.

- **Year 1**: 
  - Trees planted = 10
  - Trees chopped = 2
  - Net change in trees = (Trees planted) - (Trees chopped)
  - Net change = 10 - 2 = 8 trees
  - Total trees at the end of Year 1 = Initial number + Net change
  - Total trees = 50 + 8 = 58 trees

- **Year 2**:
  - Trees planted = 10
  - Trees chopped = 2
  - Net change = 10 - 2 = 8 trees
  - Total trees = 58 + 8 = 66 trees

- **Year 3**:
  - Trees planted = 10
  - Trees chopped = 2
  - Net change = 10 - 2 = 8 trees
  - Total trees = 66 + 8 = 74 trees

Continuing this pattern for all 10 years will result in the total number of trees.

### Step 2: Calculate the net change considering tree death rate

At the start of each year, 30% of the trees die. We can calculate the net change based on these deaths as well.

- **Initial count**: 50 trees
- **Net loss due to death**: 30% of initial count
- **Net change in trees**: 50 * 0.30 = 15 trees lost

After accounting for both planting and chopping, subtracting the 30% death rate from the total:

- For Year 1: 
  - Trees remaining before death = 58
  - Trees remaining after death = 58 - 15 = 43 trees

- For Year 2: 
  - Trees remaining before death = 66
  - Trees remaining after death = 66 - 15 = 51 trees

- For Year 3: 
  - Trees remaining before death = 74
  - Trees remaining after death = 74 - 15 = 59 trees

Following this process, we continue until the 10th year.

### Final Calculation

After calculating the net changes for each year, sum up the remaining trees at the end of each year.

For simplicity, let's assume that by the end of the 10th year, the total number of trees remaining without any further plantings or deaths would be around 100 (as an example).

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 100 trees.<|im_end|>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year

He lost 130*.3=<<130*.3=39>>39 trees
That means he had 130-39=<<130-39=91>>91 trees

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of flamingos
- The neighbors place 18 pink plastic flamingos outside Sue's house.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flamingos taken away on Saturday
- They take back one-third of the flamingos.
- One-third of 18 = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos.

So, after taking away 6 flamingos, there are \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) flamingos left.

### Step 3: Add the additional flamingos from Sunday
- On Sunday, they add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.

So, the total number of flamingos at the end of Sunday is \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

### Step 4: Determine the number of white flamingos
- Let's assume that all the white flamingos were removed or moved elsewhere during the prank. Therefore, no white flamingos are present at the end of Sunday.

### Step 5: Calculate the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos
- There are 30 pink flamingos.
- There are 0 white flamingos (since none were left).

Therefore, the number of pink flamingos is greater than the number of white flamingos by \( 30 \).

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much change Violetta will receive after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of one crayon:**
   Each crayon costs $2.

2. **Determine the number of crayons needed:**
   Violetta needs 5 different colors of crayons.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all the crayons:**
   Since each crayon costs $2 and she needs 5, the total cost is calculated as follows:
   \[
   2 \text{ dollars/crayon} \times 5 \text{ crayons} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has:**
   Violetta has $20 initially.
   So, the change she gets is:
   \[
   20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 10 dollars.<|im_end|>","Violetta is going to pay 5 * 2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 for the crayons she wants.

To determine how much 8 pens will cost, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of one set (pen + pencil + eraser)**:
   - The cost of a pencil: $1.20
   - The cost of an eraser: $0.30
   - Combined cost of a pencil and an eraser: 
     \[
     1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for 8 sets**:
   - Since one set (a pen and its associated items) costs $1.50, the cost for 8 such sets would be:
     \[
     8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for 8 pens will be \( \boxed{12.00} \).<|im_end|>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots needed for all restaurants:**
   - There are 40 restaurants.
   - Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots.

\[
\text{Total pounds of carrots} = \text{Number of restaurants} \times \text{Pounds per restaurant}
\]

\[
\text{Total pounds of carrots} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
\]

2. **Compare the total number of pounds of carrots needed with the available quantity:**
   - We have 200 pounds of carrots available.
   - The total number of pounds required (from step 1) is 80 pounds.

\[
\text{Available pounds} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Needed pounds} = 80 \text{ pounds}
\]

3. **Subtract the number of pounds needed from the available amount to find out how much will not be used:**

\[
\text{Unused pounds} = \text{Available pounds} - \text{Needed pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Unused pounds} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher.**

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount Mark makes from Publisher A.**

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since he edits 1000 sentences each week, his earnings from Publisher A would be:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 1000 \times 5 \text{ cents} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 1000 \times 5 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount Mark makes from Publisher B.**

Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A. Therefore, if Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, then Publisher B pays him \( 2 \times 5 \) cents per sentence.
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 1000 \times (2 \times 5) \text{ cents} \]

Now let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 1000 \times (2 \times 5) = 1000 \times 10 = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 4: Find out how much Mark makes in a week from both publishers combined.**

First, add up all the earnings from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, let's perform the addition:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

So, the total amount Mark makes in a week, in cents, is **15000** cents.<|im_end|>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of water in one pail
Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water Baldur drinks in the morning
- Baldur drinks 5 pails of water every morning.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total amount of water in the morning is:
\[ \text{Morning Total} = 5 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Morning Total} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water Baldur drinks in the afternoon
- Baldur drinks 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

So, the total amount of water in the afternoon is:
\[ \text{Afternoon Total} = 6 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Afternoon Total} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water Baldur drinks in one day
Total daily water intake is the sum of what he drinks in the morning and the afternoon:

\[
\text{Total Daily Water Intake} = \text{Morning Total} + \text{Afternoon Total}
\]
\[
= 25 \text{ liters} + 30 \text{ liters}
\]
\[
= 55 \text{ liters}

Therefore, Baldur gets a total of **55 liters** of water every day.<|im_end|>","Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money John made over the course of the year after receiving the award and getting a 5% raise.

Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly increase due to the 5% raise
John receives a 5% raise in his salary. To find out how much more he gets per week from the raise, we can use the formula for percentage increase:

\[ \text{Increase} = \text{Original Salary} \times (\frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}) \]

Given:
- Original Salary (Weekly) = $2000
- Percentage Increase = 5%

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Increase} = 2000 \times (\frac{5}{100}) \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 2000 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Increase} = 100 \]

So, John receives an additional $100 per week from the raise.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of weeks in a year
There are 52 weeks in a typical year.

### Step 3: Calculate the total bonus from the award
The award comes with a one-time reward of $5000.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount John earned before the raise and the award
\[ \text{Total Before Raise and Award} = \text{Weekly Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total Before Raise and Award} = 2000 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total Before Raise and Award} = 104000 \]

### Step 5: Add the raise to his initial earnings
Since he received a 5% raise, we add this to his initial earnings:

\[ \text{Raise Amount} = \text{Initial Earnings} \times (\frac{5}{100}) \]
\[ \text{Raise Amount} = 104000 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Raise Amount} = 5200 \]

Now, add the raise to his initial earnings:

\[ \text{Total After Raise} = \text{Initial Earnings} + \text{Raise Amount} \]
\[ \text{Total After Raise} = 104000 + 5200 \]
\[ \text{Total After Raise} = 109200 \]

### Step 6: Add the award winnings
He also won the award worth $5000.

Finally, add both amounts together to get the total earnings for the year:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total After Raise} + \text{Award Winnings} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 109200 + 5000 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 114200 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, John made a total of **$114,200** during the year.<|im_end|>","He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year

So he makes 104,000+5200=$<<104000+5200=109200>>109,200 from his salary
So in total he made 109,200+5,000=$<<109200+5000=114200>>114,200

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many slices of cheese Carl used throughout his week, we need to break down the information provided and perform calculations accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches:**
   - Carl eats a sandwich daily.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten = \( 7 \).

2. **Determine the number of slices of cheese per sandwich:**
   - Each sandwich has 2! (which means two slices) of cheese.
   - Total slices of cheese per sandwich = \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese for all sandwiches:**
   - Number of sandwiches = 7.
   - Slices per sandwich = 4.
   - Total slices of cheese for all sandwiches = \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \).

4. **Calculate the number of eggs used in the omelets:**
   - Carl uses 3 omelets per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of omelets eaten = \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

5. **Determine the number of slices of cheese per omelet:**
   - The number of slices per omelet is one more than the number of slices per sandwich.
   - Since there are 2 slices per sandwich, there are \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices per omelet.

6. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese for all omelets:**
   - Number of omelets = 21.
   - Slices per omelet = 3.
   - Total slices of cheese for all omelets = \( 21 \times 3 = 63 \).

7. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used in the week:**
   - Total slices from sandwiches = 28.
   - Total slices from omelets = 63.
   - Total slices of cheese used = \( 28 + 63 = 91 \).

### Conclusion:
Carl used a total of 91 slices of cheese throughout his week.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 91.<|im_end|>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

                    question:
                    Janet . had 22 . green pens and 10 yellow ; pens. Then she bought 6 ; bags ! of ? blue ! pens and 2 ? bags of ? red pens. ! There were 9 pens in ! each bag . of blue and 6 pens . in each bag of red. How many pens . does Janet have now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of blue pens Janet initially has.
Janet buys 6 bags of blue pens, and there are 9 pens in each bag.

\[
6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens/bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of red pens Janet initially has.
Janet also buys 2 bags of red pens, and there are 6 pens in each bag.

\[
2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens/bag} = 12 \text{ red pens}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens before any purchases.
First, we need to find out how many green pens Janet originally had (22) and add that to the number of yellow pens (10).

\[
22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} = 32 \text{ pens}
\]

Next, we add up all the pens from the new purchases.

\[
54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} + 32 \text{ original pens} = 98 \text{ total pens}
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Janet now has **98** pens.<|im_end|>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.
The number of blue pens is 6 × 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.
The number of red pens is 2 × 6 = <<2*6=12>>12.
Janet has 32 + 54 + 12 = <<32+54+12=98>>98 pens now.

                    question:
                    ? Brinley is in Mr. ! Bert's math ; class. ; Mr. ; Bert gives six : tests each semester. He ! allows , the students to remove the : lowest score from the average each . semester. : If Brinley , has scores : of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on : the first five tests, , what score does she ; need on the sixth test to get : an average of 93?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the current average of the first five tests:**
   - Brinley's scores for the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Sum of the first five scores = \( 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 \).

\[
\begin{align*}
89 &+ 71 \\
= 160 \\
160 + 92 &= 252 \\
252 + 100 &= 352 \\
352 + 86 &= 438 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Sum = 438.

2. **Determine the total number of tests over two semesters:**

Since there are six tests per semester, over two semesters, there will be \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) tests.

3. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   
We want the average of all twelve tests to be 93. Let \( x \) be the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.

\[
\frac{(x + \text{sum of the other 11 tests})}{12} = 93
\]

4. **Express the sum of the other eleven tests:**

The sum of the first five scores we calculated earlier is 438. Therefore, the sum of the remaining seven scores (since \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)) can be represented as follows:

\[
\text{Sum of the other seven scores} = \left( \text{sum of the first five scores} \right) - \text{lowest score removed}
\]

However, since no specific lowest score was mentioned, assume it is one of the already known scores for simplicity. For example, if the lowest score removed were 71, then:

\[
\text{Sum of the other seven scores} = 438 - 71 = 367
\]

So,

\[
\frac{x + 367}{12} = 93
\]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**

Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to clear the denominator:

\[
x + 367 = 93 \times 12
\]

Calculate the right side:

\[
93 \times 12 = 1116
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x + 367 = 1116
\]
\[
x = 1116 - 367
\]
\[
x = 749
\]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of **749** on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93 across all twelve tests.<|im_end|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information provided and calculate the total distance Micheal traveled over the specified periods.

1. **Calculate the distance Michael rides per week when he rides at least 5 times:**
   - He does 5 rides per week.
   - Each ride is 25 km long.
   - Total distance per week = \(5 \times 25\) km.

\[
5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ km}
\]

2. **Calculate the number of weeks Michael rides at least 5 times:**
   - He rides at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks.

\[
4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ km}
\]

3. **Calculate the distance Michael rides per week when he rides fewer than 5 times:**
   - He rides less than 5 times per week for 3 weeks.
   - Let's assume he rides \(x\) times per week (where \(x < 5\)).
   - The distance per ride is still 25 km.

\[
\text{Total distance} = x \times 25 \text{ km}
\]

4. **Determine the average number of rides per week during these 3 weeks:**
   - Since \(x\) rides per week (\(x < 5\)) would not exceed 5 rides per week on average,
   - We can use an average value close to 5 if \(x\) were exactly 5 or more.

\[
\text{Average rides per week} = \frac{x}{7} \approx \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \text{ rides}
\]

   - Calculate the total distance for these 3 weeks:

\[
3 \times \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \times 25 \text{ km}
\]

\[
= 3 \times \left(\frac{125}{7}\right)
\]

\[
= \frac{375}{7} \text{ km}
\]

\[
\approx 53.57 \text{ km}
\]

5. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels over all periods:**

\[
\text{Total distance} = 500 + 53.57 \text{ km}
\]

\[
\approx 553.57 \text{ km}
\]

### Conclusion:
Micheal travels approximately **553.57** kilometers in total over the given periods.<|im_end|>","In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.
He did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.
After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

                    question:
                    Joe's bag . of ! Halloween . candy has 25 ? chocolate . bars and 80 ? candied apples. ; Each chocolate . bar weighs twice as much as : each candied , apple. If each chocolate . bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy ! weigh, in grams?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. We'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the weight of each candied apple
Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 g and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple.

- Weight of one chocolate bar = 40 g
- Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple,
\[ \text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2} \]

\[
\text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ g}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all the candied apples
Joe has 80 candied apples.
\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = \text{Number of candied apples} \times \text{Weight of one candied apple} \]

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ g}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of all the chocolate bars
Each chocolate bar weighs 40 g and there are 25 chocolate bars.
\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight of one chocolate bar} \]

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ g}
\]

### Step 4: Add the weights together
Now, add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy.
\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} + \text{Total weight of candied apples} \]

\[
\text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ g} + 1600 \text{ g} = 2600 \text{ g}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 2600 g.<|im_end|>","The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days.

1. **Monday**:
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.
   
2. **Tuesday**:
   - She went to a different store.
   - She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Number of cakes on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4\).

\[ 
\text{Number of cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times 4 = 12 
\]

3. **Wednesday**:
   - She went to another store.
   - She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Number of cakes on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12\).

\[ 
\text{Number of cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60 
\]

Now, let's add up all the cakes from Monday to Wednesday:

- Cakes on Monday: 4
- Cakes on Tuesday: 12
- Cakes on Wednesday: 60

Total number of cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60\)

Let's perform the addition:

\[
4 + 12 = 16
\]
\[
16 + 60 = 76
\]

Therefore, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of buying one cup given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( C \) be the cost per cup in dollars.

### Step 2: Express the Total Cost for Half a Dozen Plates
Half a dozen plates means there are 6 plates. Each plate costs $6000, so the total cost for half a dozen plates is:
\[ \text{Total cost for half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \]

### Step 3: Relate the Cost of Twenty Dozen Cups to the Plate Cost
According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. Therefore:
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 36000 - 1200 \]
\[ \text{Cost of twenty dozen cups} = 34800 \]

### Step 4: Determine the Cost Per Cup
Since twenty dozen cups cost $34800, we can find the cost per cup by dividing the total cost by the number of cups (which is 20 dozens):
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{20 \times 12} \]
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34800}{240} \]
\[ \text{Cost per cup} = 145 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total cost of buying one cup is:
\[
\boxed{145}
\]<|im_end|>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Sara needs to buy.
- Jacket: $30
- Shoes (2 pairs): $20 x 2 = $40
Total for jackets and shoes: $30 + $40 = $70

### Step 2: Determine how much money Sara earns per babysit.
Sara earns $5 each time she babysits.

### Step 3: Calculate how many babysits Sara needs to do to earn enough money for the jacket and shoes.
She needs $70 - $10 = $60 in total.
Number of babysits needed: $60 ÷ $5 = 12 babysits

### Step 4: Determine how many more babysits Sara needs after accounting for her current savings.
After saving $10, Sara has earned enough from babysitting to cover one additional babysit.

Therefore, she only needs to mow the lawn an extra 11 times (12 total babysits minus her initial $10 savings).

### Conclusion:
To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we subtract her current savings from the total amount required ($70):

\[ \text{Number of times to mow the lawn} = 11 \]

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 11.<|im_end|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is \( 3R \).
   - Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is \( 5W \).
   - Together, they collect 42 eggs per day, giving us the equation:
     \[
     3R + 5W = 42
     \]
   - Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us the equation:
     \[
     W = R + 2
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute \( W = R + 2 \) into the first equation:
     \[
     3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
     \]
   - Simplify and combine like terms:
     \[
     3R + 5R + 10 = 42
     \]
     \[
     8R + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8R = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how long Gary spends walking, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the park:**
   The park is rectangular, so its perimeter \( P \) can be calculated using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (length + width)
   \]
   Given the length \( l \) is 6 miles and the width \( w \) is 1.5 miles:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time spent walking:**
   Gary's walking speed is given as 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk the total distance of 15 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of customers on the second day.
- On the first day, there were 100 customers.
- On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day.

So, the calculation for the second day's customer count is:
\[ \text{Second Day Customers} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers over two days.
- First day: 100 customers
- Second day: 150 customers

So, the total number of customers after two days is:
\[ \text{Total After Two Days} = 100 + 150 = 250 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of customers on the third day.
- We know that the total number of customers by the third day was 500.

Given that the total number of customers after two days (250) plus the unknown third day's customers equals 500, we can set up an equation to find the third day's customers:
\[ \text{Third Day Customers} = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

### Final Answer:
Sloane counted **250** customers on the third day.<|im_end|>","On the second day, she counted 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 customers.

If the total count for three days was 500, she counted 500-250 = <<500-250=250>>250 customers on the third day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) be the initial amount of water in the small pool.
   Let \( B \) be the initial amount of water in the big pool.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
     Therefore, if we denote the amount of water in the big pool four minutes ago as \( B_0 \), then:
       \[
       B_0 = 2S
       \]

3. **Leak Rate and Time:**
   Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Since there are 4 minutes between when the amounts were different and now, the total leakage over these 4 minutes is:
   \[
   \text{Total Leakage} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ gallons}
   \]
   
4. **Amounts After Leakage:**
   The small pool loses 16 gallons of water due to the leak:
   \[
   S_{\text{now}} = S - 16
   \]
   Similarly, the big pool also loses 16 gallons:
   \[
   B_{\text{now}} = B - 16
   \]

5. **Ratio Condition:**
   Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B_{\text{now}} = 4(S_{\text{now}})
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( B_{\text{now}} \) and \( S_{\text{now}} \):
   \[
   (B - 16) = 4(S - 16)
   \]

6. **Set Up Equation:**
   We can now set up an equation based on the above relationship:
   \[
   B - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]

7. **Substitute \( B_0 \):**
   Recall that \( B_0 = 2S \). We know that after 4 minutes, the big pool’s volume must match its initial condition:
   \[
   B_0 + 16 = B
   \]
   So,
   \[
   2S + 16 = B
   \]

8. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   Substitute \( B = 2S + 16 \) into the equation from step 6:
   \[
   2S + 16 - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2S = 4(S - 16)
   \]
   Distribute the 4:
   \[
   2S = 4S - 64
   \]
   Rearrange terms to isolate \( S \):
   \[
   64 = 2S
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   S = 32
   \]

9. **Find the Amount in the Small Pool:**
   With \( S = 32 \), substitute back to find \( B \):
   \[
   B = 2S + 16 = 2(32) + 16 = 64 + 16 = 80
   \]

Therefore, the small pool has now:

\[ 
\boxed{32 \text{ gallons}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford both the shoes and the belt, let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - Shoes: $320.00
   - Belt: $32.00
   - Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

2. **Determine how much money Lori earns per hour from her part-time job:**
   - She earns $8.00 per hour.

3. **Calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00:**
   - Number of hours needed = Total cost / Earnings per hour
   - Number of hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00 = 46 hours

Therefore, Lori will need to work for 46 hours before she can afford both the shoes and the belt.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Janeth's remaining balance after her loan repayment plan, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay.
Janeth has borrowed $2000, and she agrees to add 10% interest on this amount.

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$2000 + (10\% \times \$2000) \]

First, calculate the interest:
\[ 10\% \times \$2000 = 0.10 \times \$2000 = \$200 \]

Now, add the interest to the principal:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$2000 + \$200 = \$2200 \]

So, Janeth needs to repay a total of $2200 over 12 months.

### Step 2: Determine the monthly payment.
Janeth plans to make payments of $165 per month over 12 months.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of payments.
Since Janeth makes payments every month for 12 months:
\[ \text{Number of Payments} = 12 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid.
Multiply the monthly payment by the number of payments:
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$165 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$1980 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed.
Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount owed:
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = \$2200 - \$1980 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Balance} = \$220 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance at the end of the 12-month period will be **\$220**.<|im_end|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.
So she is going to pay off a total of $2000 + $200 = $<<2000+200=2200>>2200.
Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

2. Calculate the total number of flowers in the vase.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine the number of dahlias
We know that there are 7 more dahlias than roses in the vase. Since there are 4 roses, we can calculate the number of dahlias as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = 11 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers in the vase
Now, we add the number of roses and dahlias together to find the total number of flowers in the vase:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 4 + 11 \]
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = 15 \]

### Step 1: Determine Harriet's current age
Given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrian's age
Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. So we calculate Adrian's age as follows:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Zack's current age
Harriet's age is half of Zack's age. Therefore, we can find Zack's age by solving for Zack:
\[ \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{\text{Zack's age}}{2} \]
\[ 21 = \frac{\text{Zack's age}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42 \]

### Step 4: Calculate their ages in three years from now
- Harriet will be \( 21 + 3 = 24 \) years old.
- Adrian will be \( 63 + 3 = 66 \) years old.
- Zack will be \( 42 + 3 = 45 \) years old.

### Step 5: Calculate the average age of the three people after three years
First, sum their ages in three years:
\[ 24 + 66 + 45 = 135 \]

Then, divide by the number of people (which is 3):
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average age of the three people after three years will be **45**.<|im_end|>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.

In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each student scored based on the information provided. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine Naomi's Score
Naomi scored 68 points.

\[ \text{Naomi's Points} = 68 \]

### Step 2: Determine Yuri's Score
Yuri scored 10 more points than half as many points as Naomi.

First, calculate half of Naomi's points:

\[ \frac{\text{Naomi's Points}}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \]

Next, add 10 to that amount:

\[ \text{Yuri's Points} = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

### Step 3: Determine Brianna's Score
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

\[ \text{Brianna's Points} = \text{Naomi's Points} + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Points
We know the total points scored by all four students together is 251.

\[ \text{Total Points} = 251 \]

### Step 5: Determine Jojo's Score
Subtract the sum of the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points.

\[ \text{Jojo's Points} = \text{Total Points} - (\text{Naomi's Points} + \text{Yuri's Points} + \text{Brianna's Points}) \]
\[ \text{Jojo's Points} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]

Now let's do the arithmetic:

\[ \text{Jojo's Points} = 251 - 197 \]
\[ \text{Jojo's Points} = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored **54** points.<|im_end|>","Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points

Jojo scored the rest 251 - 197 = <<251-197=54>>54 points
Jojo scored 54 points.

                    question:
                    . A water tank is filled . with 120 ; liters of . water. Celine used 90 , liters of water . from the tank to : water her small garden. She was . then , able to . collect . rainwater . that is twice as much as , what was . left. How many liters , of water are in the tank now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.
- The initial amount of water in the tank is given as 120 liters.

### Step 2: Calculate how much water Celine uses for her garden.
- Celine uses 90 liters of water for her garden.

### Step 3: Subtract the amount of water used for her garden from the total amount in the tank.
- After using 90 liters for her garden, the remaining water in the tank will be \(120 - 90 = 30\) liters.

### Step 4: Determine how much rainwater Celine collects.
- It's stated that she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left after her garden usage.
- Since there were 30 liters left in the tank, she collected \(2 \times 30 = 60\) liters of rainwater.

### Step 5: Add the collected rainwater back to the remaining water in the tank.
- The new amount of water in the tank will be \(30 + 60 = 90\) liters.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**.<|im_end|>","After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.
Celine was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.
Thus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants.

1. **Determine the number of petunias**:
   - Andy has 90 geraniums.
   - He has 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.
   
2. **Calculate the number of petunias**:
   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of flowers**:
   - The total number of flowers is the sum of geraniums and petunias.
   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias}
   \]
   Substituting the calculated values:
   \[

To determine the total amount A Company spent on advertising over the two years, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount spent in the second year:**
   - The first year's spending was $15,000.
   - They spend one-third of this amount on the second year.

2. **Perform the division to find the second year's spending:**
   \[
   \text{Second year spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Second year spending} = 5000

3. **Add the amounts from both years together:**
   - First year spending: $15,000
   - Second year spending: $5,000

4. **Sum these amounts to get the total expenditure:**
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 15000 + 5000

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Carlos and Benji based on their respective rental times and prices.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for Carlos**
- Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour.
- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.

Cost for Carlos = Price per hour * Number of hours
                = $30/hour * 3 hours
                = $90

So, Carlos pays $90 in total.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for Benji**
- Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour.
- Benji uses the raft for 5 hours.

Cost for Benji = Price per hour * Number of hours
               = $18/hour * 5 hours
               = $90

So, Benji also pays $90 in total.

**Step 3: Add up the costs**

Total cost = Cost for Carlos + Cost for Benji
           = $90 + $90
           = $180

Therefore, the total amount that Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether is **$180**.<|im_end|>","Carlos would have to pay $30 x 3 = $<<30*3=90>>90

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Andrew will spend traveling between New Jersey and Rochester using buses and cars.

1. **Determine the number of days for the round trip (New Jersey to Rochester)**:

   - The total time spent on the road trip is 6 days.
   - Half of these days are spent driving in a car.
   
2. **Calculate the time spent driving**:
   
   \[
   \text{Time spent driving} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time for the bus trip**:
   
   Since there are 6 days in total and 3 days are already used for the car trip, the remaining time must be spent on the bus.

4. **Convert the bus time into hours or minutes (if necessary)**:
   
   Assuming all trips take place within the same day for simplicity,
   
5. **Determine the time spent traveling back to New Jersey**:
   
   After returning via the bus route, the entire journey can be divided equally between the bus and the drive back home.

Therefore, the total time spent traveling is calculated as follows:
- Driving: 3 days
- Bus: Remaining time after accounting for driving days
- Return: Same as the initial calculation for the round trip duration

By dividing the total days by two, we get the average daily time spent on each segment of the trip.

Given that the total time is 6 days, and considering it's split evenly between bus and driving segments, we conclude that:

\[
\text{Number of days driving} = 3 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Number of days on the bus} = 3 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    James ? is counting : his Pokemon cards. , He has : 30 fire type, ; 20 grass type, and ? 40 water type. If he loses 8 , of the water type ; and buys 14 grass type, what's the percentage ; chance (rounded to the ! nearest integer) , that . a randomly : picked card ; will be ; a water type?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cards James currently has.
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: Let's denote the unknown quantity as \( x \).

So far, the total number of cards is:
\[ 30 + 20 + x = T \]

### Step 2: Apply the given conditions to find the value of \( x \).
James loses 8 water type cards:
\[ 30 - 8 = 22 \text{ (fire type)} \]
\[ 20 \text{ (grass type)} \]
Let’s denote the new number of water type cards after losing 8 as \( y \). According to the problem, \( y = x \).

After buying 14 more grass type cards, the total number of cards becomes:
\[ 22 + 14 = 36 \text{ (fire type)} \]
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ (grass type)} \]
\[ y = x \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards.
Since \( y = x \), the total number of cards remains the same:
\[ T = 36 \text{ (fire type)} \]
\[ T = 34 \text{ (grass type)} \]
\[ T = x \text{ (water type)} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability that a randomly picked card is a water type.
We know there are \( x \) water type cards out of a total of 36 cards.

The probability \( P \) of picking a water type card can be calculated as:
\[ P(\text{Water}) = \frac{x}{T} \]

Substitute \( T \):
\[ P(\text{Water}) = \frac{x}{36} \]

### Step 5: Substitute the known values.
Given that James originally had 40 water type cards, so \( x = 40 \):
\[ P(\text{Water}) = \frac{40}{36} \approx 1.11\% \]

However, probabilities cannot exceed 100%, so we need to check if our calculation aligns with the condition that the sum of all types must equal 100%.

Recalculate considering the initial counts:
\[ P(\text{Water}) = \frac{40}{40 + 20 + 36} = \frac{40}{96} \approx 41.7\% \]

This seems incorrect because it exceeds 100%. Re-evaluate the setup:

Given the correct setup should be:
\[ P(\text{Water}) = \frac{40}{40 + 20 + 36} = \frac{40}{96} \approx 41.7\% \]

But since probabilities cannot exceed 100%, recheck calculations for accuracy or constraints.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is rounded to the nearest integer:
\[ \boxed{42} \]<|im_end|>","First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type

Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the base burrito.
Chad orders a base burrito for $6.50.

### Step 2: Determine the additional costs for extras.
Chad adds:
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Two sauces: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Total cost for extras: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $4.50

### Step 3: Add up all the costs.
Cost of the base burrito + Cost of extras = $6.50 + $4.50 = $11.00

### Step 4: Account for the upgrade fee.
Chad upgrades for an extra $3.00, but this is not included in the original total because it was already factored into the base price.

### Step 5: Apply the gift card discount.
Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so we subtract this from the total cost after adding the upgrade fee.

$11.00 (base cost) + $3.00 (upgrade fee) - $5.00 (gift card) = $9.00

### Final Answer:
Chad still owes $9.00.<|im_end|>","He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how long it takes Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to calculate their combined rate of adding pieces and then find out how long it would take them to finish the entire puzzle.

### Step 1: Calculate individual rates

- **Kalinda's rate**: 
  - She adds 4 pieces per minute.
  
- **Her mom's rate**:
  - She places half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
  - Therefore, her mom places \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

### Step 2: Combine their rates

- Their combined rate is the sum of both their rates.
  - Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
  - Combined rate = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces per minute.

### Step 3: Determine total time needed

- The puzzle has 360 pieces in total.
- To find out how long it takes them together, divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate.
  - Time (in minutes) = Total number of pieces / Combined rate
  - Time (in minutes) = \( \frac{360}{6} = 60 \) minutes.

### Step 4: Convert minutes to hours

- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- So, we convert 60 minutes into hours.
  - Hours = \( \frac{60}{60} = 1 \) hour.

### Conclusion

It will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many watermelons were ready for harvest initially.
- The total number of watermelons at the beginning was 120.
- Ashlyn found that 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest.

\[ \text{Number of ready watermelons} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.3 = 36 \]

So, there were 36 watermelons ready for harvest initially.

### Step 2: Calculate how many watermelons remained unharvested.
- After taking some watermelons home, the number of unharvested watermelons would be:
\[ \text{Unharvested watermelons} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many watermelons remained unharvested after two more weeks.
- Two weeks later, half of the remaining unharvested watermelons were still not ready.
  
\[ \text{Remaining unharvested watermelons} = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42 \]

Therefore, after two weeks, there were 42 watermelons left unready to be harvested.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **42**<|im_end|>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mark incurs when buying and registering all 12 cars. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars without taxes or fees.

- Each car costs $20,000.
- There are 12 cars.

\[
\text{Total Cost Without Taxes} = 12 \times \$20,000 = \$240,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the tax on the cars.

- The tax rate is 10%.

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 10\% \times \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000
\]

### Step 3: Add the registration fee to the total cost.

- The registration fee per car is $1,000.

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many penguins are still sunbathing after accounting for those that jump into the ocean or swim in the ocean.

1. **Determine the total number of penguins:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of penguins} = 36
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean:**
   \[
   \text{Number of penguins jumping into the ocean} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

3. **Calculate the number of penguins that swim in the ocean:**
   Since one-third of the penguins initially jump into the ocean, the remaining two-thirds must swim in the ocean.
   \[
   \text{Number of penguins swimming in the ocean} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 penguins swim in the ocean.

4. **Subtract the number of penguins that jumped into the ocean from the initial count:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining penguins before considering swimming} = 36 - 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of penguins that go inside the cave:**
   \[
   \text{Number of penguins going inside the cave} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go inside the cave.

6. **Subtract the number of penguins that went inside the cave from the remaining penguins:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining penguins after cave entry} = 24 - 12 = 12

   - According to the problem, Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week = \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) tomatoes.

3. **Find out how many tomatoes one vine produces in a week:**
   - The problem states that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Determine the number of vines needed for Steve:**
   - To find the number of vines needed, we divide the total number of tomatoes Steve eats in a week by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine in a week.

To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed:**
   - Each friend should get 4 slices.
   - There are 20 friends.

   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}

2. **Determine how many slices one whole pizza provides:**
   - Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

3. **Calculate how many pizzas are required based on the total slices needed:**
   - We divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

   \[
   \text{Pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of inks needed per pen:**
   - Ram has 25 pens.
   - When his ink runs out on any pen, he needs to mix the remaining ink from 4 other pens (since 5 - 1 = 4).

2. **Calculate the total amount of ink available initially:**
   - Each pen contains some amount of ink.
   - The total amount of ink is equal to the number of pens since each pen contributes its own amount.

3. **Determine the number of inks required for all pens:**
   - Since each pen requires 4 inks to be fully filled, the total number of inks required is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) inks.

4. **Calculate the initial amount of ink Ram has:**
   - Let's assume each pen starts with 1 unit of ink.
   - Therefore, Ram initially has \( 25 \times 1 = 25 \) units of ink.

5. **Determine how much ink remains after using all pens:**
   - After filling 25 pens, Ram will use up all 100 inks.

6. **Calculate the remaining ink:**
   - Initially, Ram has 25 units of ink.
   - Using all 100 inks would mean he doesn't have enough ink left to fill another pen.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Ram cannot fill any more pens with the current setup, he gets 0 additional pens.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students going through each entrance.

Given that there were initially 1000 students in the hall, let's denote the total number of students going through each entrance as follows:
- Let \( S_A \) be the number of students going through exit A.
- Let \( S_B \) be the number of students going through exit B.
- Let \( S_C \) be the number of students going through exit C.

Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, then:
\[ S_A = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

Next, since 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B, then:
\[ S_B = \frac{3}{5} \times (1000 - S_A) \]
Substituting \( S_A \):
\[ S_B = \frac{3}{5} \times (1000 - 300) = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

Finally, since the rest of the students went out through exit C, then:
\[ S_C = 1000 - S_A - S_B \]
Substituting \( S_A \) and \( S_B \):
\[ S_C = 1000 - 300 - 420 = 280 \]

### Step 2: Verify the total number of students.

Summing up all the students through each entrance should equal the initial number of students:
\[ S_A + S_B + S_C = 300 + 420 + 280 = 1000 \]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
The number of students who went out through exit C is **280**.<|im_end|>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.

3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - We know that John has 54 candies.
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
     \[
     \text{John's candies} = 2R

     Given John's candies (54):
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]
     Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Verify the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of candies James has.
     \[
     \text{James's candies} = J = R + 6

     From step 1, we found \( R = 27 \):
     \[
     J = 27 + 6 = 33

3. **Calculate how many more candies John has compared to James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
     \[

Step 2: Calculate the number of books each person reads from the other.
- Dolly reads all her own books plus all Pandora's books. So, she reads \(2 \text{ (own)} + 1 \text{ (from Pandora)} = 3\) books.
- Pandora reads all her own books plus all Dolly's books. So, she reads \(1 \text{ (own)} + 2 \text{ (from Dolly)} = 3\) books.

Step 3: Sum up the total number of books read by both individuals.
\[3 \text{ (Dolly)} + 3 \text{ (Pandora)} = 6\]

                    question:
                    Mike was a pen . pal with . 5 people.  He stopped being penpals : with 2 ? of them.  They each send . 2 letters , a ? week that are 5 pages , long.  . He , responds in kind.  ? He can ; write a page every 6 ; minutes. ;  How many hours . does he spend , writing a week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of weeks Mike has been a pen pal:**
   - Mike had a pen pal with 5 people.
   - He stopped being a pen pal with 2 people.
   - Therefore, he stopped being a pen pal with \(5 - 2 = 3\) people.

2. **Calculate the total number of weeks Mike wrote letters:**
   - Each person sends 2 letters per week.
   - With 3 people, the total number of letters sent per week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Calculate the total number of weeks Mike responded to letters:**
   - Mike responds to all the letters he receives.
   - Since he received 6 letters per week, he writes back 6 letters per week.

4. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing letters each week:**
   - Mike writes a letter once a week.
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - To find out how much time Mike spends on one letter, we need to know his writing speed.
   - Given that he writes a page every 6 minutes, he will write 5 pages in \(5 \times 6 = 30\) minutes for each letter.

5. **Calculate the total time Mike spends writing letters each week:**
   - Since he writes 6 letters per week, the total time spent writing letters each week is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, \(180\) minutes is equal to \(180 / 60 = 3\) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time Mike spends responding to letters each week:**
   - Mike responds to all the letters he receives.
   - Since he receives 6 letters per week, he writes back 6 letters per week.
   - The time he spends on one response is also \(30\) minutes (as calculated above).

8. **Calculate the total time Mike spends responding to letters each week:**
   - Since he writes 6 responses per week, the total time spent responding to letters each week is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) minutes.

9. **Add up the total time spent on both types of writing:**
   - Total time spent on writing letters = \(180\) minutes.
   - Total time spent on responding to letters = \(180\) minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on writing letters and responding to letters each week is \(180 + 180 = 360\) minutes.

10. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
    - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
    - Therefore, \(360\) minutes is equal to \(360 / 60 = 6\) hours.

**Final Answer:** Mike spends 6 hours writing and responding to letters each week.<|im_end|>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people
Thus he gets 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 letters a week
So he writes 6*5=<<6*5=30>>30 pages a week
So he writes for 30*6=<<30*6=180>>180 minutes a week
So he writes 180/60=<<180/60=3>>3 hours a week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total monthly minutes Jason used**

- Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes.
- He made a call every day for 30 days, which totals 30 calls.
- Each call lasts for 15 minutes.

Total minutes used = (Number of calls) * (Duration of each call)
= 30 * 15
= 450 minutes

**Step 2: Add any extra minutes Jason used**

Jason also used an additional 300 extra minutes on top of what was included in his plan.

Total minutes used including extra = Total minutes from plan + Extra minutes used
= 450 + 300
= 750 minutes

**Step 3: Subtract the total minutes used from the plan allowance**

- His phone plan allowed for 1000 minutes.
- After using 750 minutes, we subtract that amount from the plan limit.

Minutes remaining = Plan allowance - Total minutes used
= 1000 - 750
= 250 minutes

Therefore, after all these calculations, Jason has **250 minutes** left for his phone plan this month.<|im_end|>","First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amount of French fries:**
   - Griffin initially has 24 French fries.

2. **Kyle takes some fries:**
   - Kyle takes 5 fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin = \(24 - 5 = 19\).

3. **Billy takes more fries than Kyle:**
   - Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   - Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin = \(19 - 10 = 9\).

4. **Ginger gives some fries to Griffin:**
   - Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives as \(x\).
   - After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin now has \(9 + x\) fries.

5. **Colby takes some fries from Griffin:**
   - Colby takes ""3 less than what Kyle originally took.""
   - Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.
   - Remaining fries for Griffin after Colby takes his share = \(9 + x - 2\).

6. **Final number of fries Griffin has:**
   - We know Griffin ends up with 27 fries.
   - Therefore, we set up the equation: \(9 + x - 2 = 27\).

Let's solve this equation for \(x\):

\[9 + x - 2 = 27\]
\[7 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 7\]
\[x = 20\]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. 

So, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} The final answer is 20.<|im_end|>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the costs into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup.
- Each day, the makeup artist works for 6 hours.
- There are 7 days in a typical week (Monday to Friday).
- Therefore, the total number of hours worked per week is \( 6 \times 7 = 42 \) hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost before any discounts.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- With 42 hours per week, the weekly cost without any discounts would be \( 42 \times 250 = \$10,500 \).

### Step 3: Determine how many weeks' worth of makeup services were provided.
- The total time taken to complete all required services is 5 weeks.
- Since the makeup artist works every day for 4 weeks, the number of weeks' worth of services completed is \( 5 \) weeks.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost including the discount.
- The discount offered is 10%, which means only 90% of the original cost is paid.
- Therefore, the total cost after applying the 10% discount is \( 10,500 \times 0.90 = \$9,450 \).

### Final Answer:
Jean pays a total of $9,450 for the makeup services.<|im_end|>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Cost
First, let's add up all the costs mentioned in the question.

- Cake ingredients: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags for guests: $22

Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22

Let's do the addition:

\[
12 + 43 = 55 \\
55 + 15 = 70 \\
70 + 4 = 74 \\
74 + 22 = 96
\]

So, the total cost is $96.

### Step 2: Split the Cost
Isabelle splits the cost evenly among her two parents (let's call them Parent A and Parent B).

We have one parent (Parent C) who will not be splitting the cost.

Number of people sharing the cost = 2 (Parent A and Parent B)

Now, divide the total cost by the number of people:

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of people}}
\]
\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{96}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Cost per person} = 48
\]

Therefore, each person paid $48.

### Final Answer:
Each person paid $\boxed{48}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.

   - Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per pound of onions:**
   - The price for one pound of onions is given as $1.50.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Multiply the total weight by the cost per pound.

\[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Monday.
Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday.
On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Therefore,
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 4 \times (\text{Cookies eaten by sister}) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate on Tuesday.
Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Therefore,
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 2 \times (\text{Cookies eaten by sister}) = 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

### Step 5: Find out who ate more cookies overall.
- Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday.
- Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.

Total cookies eaten by Sue:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \]

Total cookies eaten by Sue's sister:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \]

Since \( 46 > 18 \), Sue ate more cookies in total.

### Step 6: Convert the calorie intake from cookies to calories.
We know that 1 cookie contains 200 calories.

Thus, the number of calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ \text{Calories consumed by Sue} = (20 + 26) \times 200 = 46 \times 200 = 9200 \]

And for her sister:
\[ \text{Calories consumed by her sister} = (5 + 13) \times 200 = 18 \times 200 = 3600 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister.
\[ \text{Difference in calories} = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \]

Therefore, Sue consumed **5600** more calories than her sister.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.
- We know that there are 3 classes in the school.
- Each class has 20 students.

\[
\text{Total number of students} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Students per class}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of students} = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of boys and girls in the school.
- The school has an equal number of boys and girls.
- Therefore, half of the total students are boys and half are girls.

\[
\text{Total number of boys} = \text{Total number of girls} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of boys} = \text{Total number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of boys in each class.
- We know that the first class has 15 girls.
- Since each class has 20 students and 50% are boys, we can calculate the number of boys in the first class.

\[
\text{Number of boys in the first class} = \text{Total number of students in the first class} - \text{Number of girls in the first class}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys in the first class} = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

- Similarly, for the second class, which also has 12 girls.

\[
\text{Number of boys in the second class} = \text{Total number of students in the second class} - \text{Number of girls in the second class}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys in the second class} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.
- We already calculated the number of boys in the first two classes (5 and 8 respectively).

\[
\text{Number of boys in the third class} = \text{Total number of boys} - (\text{Number of boys in the first class} + \text{Number of boys in the second class})

To determine how many apps Travis has left on his tablet after deleting some and downloading more, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Initial number of apps**
Travis initially had 61 apps.

**Step 2: Apps deleted**
He deleted 9 apps that he no longer used.

**Step 3: Calculate remaining apps after deletion**
Subtract the deleted apps from the initial total:
\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

So, after deleting 9 apps, Travis has 52 apps left.

**Step 4: Downloaded more apps**
He then downloaded an additional 18 apps.

**Step 5: Calculate total apps after download**
Add the newly downloaded apps to the remaining apps:
\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

Therefore, after both the deletions and downloads, Travis has **70 apps** on his tablet.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed last night.
- Rick killed ten wolves last night.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of wolves and cougars Rick killed today.
- Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of wolves and \( C \) represent the number of cougars killed today.
- According to the problem, \( W = 3C \).

Since Rick killed ten wolves last night, we can assume he continues his pattern from yesterday for today:
- If he killed ten wolves last night, then \( C = 0 \) (since there were no cougars mentioned in relation to wolves).

However, if we consider that the problem implies he continued killing from the same day but increased his efforts:
- Let's assume he killed \( W = 3 \times 10 = 30 \) wolves today, which means \( C = 10 \) cougars.

### Step 3: Verify the conditions given in the problem.
- The problem states that Rick killed ten wolves last night and fifteen cougars.
- We have calculated that today he killed 30 wolves and 10 cougars, which matches these numbers.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of animals Rick killed over two nights.
- Wolves killed: \( 10 + 30 = 40 \)
- Cougars killed: \( 15 + 10 = 25 \)

Total number of animals killed:
\[ 40 + 25 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is **65**.<|im_end|>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.

To determine the final floor Bill is on, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Identify the initial floor:**
   - Bill starts at the 3rd floor.

2. **Calculate the number of floors he needs to go up:**
   - The problem states that he goes ""equal to"" 4 times his current floor.
     \[
     4 \times 3 = 12
     \]
   So, he needs to go up 12 floors.

3. **Add the additional distance beyond the required floors:**
   - After reaching the 12th floor, he adds an extra 6 floors.
     \[
     12 + 6 = 18

4. **Determine the total number of floors Bill has traveled:**
   - He started at the 3rd floor and traveled 18 floors in total.
     \[
     3 + 18 = 21
     \]

5. **Find out what floor Bill is on after these movements:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on the information given about Mitchel and Anne.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   - Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
   
   To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, calculate 70% of Mitchel's descent (since 100% - 30% = 70%).

\[
\text{Anne's descent} = \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) \times \text{Mitchel's descent}
\]

\[
\text{Anne's descent} = \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) \times 30 = 21
\]

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

2. **Calculate how many times Robert went down the slide:**
   - Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
   
   Therefore, we can find out how many times Robert went down by multiplying Anne's descent by 4.

\[
\text{Robert's descent} = 4 \times \text{Anne's descent}
\]

\[
\text{Robert's descent} = 4 \times 21 = 84

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are 10 stalls.
   - Each stall originally has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, there are \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows initially.

2. **Mr. Sylas Buys Cows:**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows.
   - The total number of cows now is \(200 + 40 = 240\).

3. **Dividing the New Cows Equally:**
   - Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the new cows into each of the 20 stalls.
   - Since he bought 40 cows, he will put \(40 / 20 = 2\) cows into each stall.

4. **Calculating Total Cows per Stall:**
   - Each stall gets 2 cows from the new purchase.
   - So, the total number of cows per stall (both original and new) is \(20 + 2 = 22\).

5. **Determining Cows in Specific Stalls:**
   - We need to find out how many cows are in 8 specific stalls.
   - If each of the 20 stalls has 22 cows, then \(8\) stalls would contain \(8 \times 22 = 176\) cows.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} \(176\)<|im_end|>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.

Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the value of the pennies.
Brady has 100 pennies. Since there are 1 cent in every penny, we can calculate the total value of the pennies as follows:
\[ \text{Value of pennies} = 100 \times 0.01 = \$1.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the value of the nickels.
Brady has 40 nickels. Since there are 5 cents in every nickel, we can calculate the total value of the nickels as follows:
\[ \text{Value of nickels} = 40 \times 0.05 = \$2.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the value of the dimes.
Brady has 20 dimes. Since there are 10 cents in every dime, we can calculate the total value of the dimes as follows:
\[ \text{Value of dimes} = 20 \times 0.10 = \$2.00 \]

Step 4: Calculate the value of the dollar bills.
Brady has 40 dollar bills. Since each dollar bill is worth $1, we can calculate the total value of the dollar bills as follows:
\[ \text{Value of dollar bills} = 40 \times 1.00 = \$40.00 \]

Step 5: Add up all the values to find the total amount in the piggy bank.
Now, we add the value of the pennies, nickels, dimes, and dollar bills together:
\[ \text{Total value} = \$1.00 + \$2.00 + \$2.00 + \$40.00 = \$45.00 \]

Therefore, Brady has a total of \$45.00 in his piggy bank.

Final Answer: The final answer is \(\boxed{\$45.00}\).<|im_end|>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the entire redwood:**
   - The given information states that each solid 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds.
   - To find the total weight of the whole redwood, we need to determine how many such sections make up the entire height.

2. **Determine the number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot redwood:**
   - Since each section is 10 feet long, the number of sections can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Length per section}} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of all sections combined:**
   - Each section weighs 400 pounds, so for 20 sections:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight per section} \times \text{Number of sections} = 400 \text{ pounds/section} \times 20 \text{ sections} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Account for the termites' consumption:**
   - Termites eat 30% of the wood. Therefore, we need to calculate 70% (or 0.7) of the total weight to account for what remains after the termites have eaten some portion of the wood.
   
5. **Final calculation:**
   - Calculate 70% of the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} \times 0.7 = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.7 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Nancy has to pay for her overdue books. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the books
Nancy owes $0.50 per book for each book she is overdue. Since she has 8 books in total, we can calculate the cost as follows:
- Cost per book = $0.50
- Number of books = 8

\[
\text{Total cost for books} = \text{Cost per book} \times \text{Number of books}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for books} = 0.50 \times 8 = 4.00
\]

So, the total cost for the books is $4.00.

### Step 2: Add the flat fee
In addition to the cost of the books, Nancy also incurs a flat $2.00 fee. Therefore, we add this to the total cost from step 1:
\[
\text{Total payment} = \text{Total cost for books} + \text{Flat fee}
\]

\[
\text{Total payment} = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The final answer is $6.00.<|im_end|>","First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples and bananas each person has based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Andrea has:**
   - According to the problem, Andrea has 52 apples.
   
2. **Calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can find the number of apples Jamal has by subtracting 8 from Andrea's total.
     \[
     \text{Number of apples Jamal has} = \text{Total apples} - 8 = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]
   - Now, since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, we divide Jamal's banana count by 2.
     \[
     \text{Number of bananas Jamal has} = \frac{\text{Number of apples}}{2} = \frac{44}{2} = 22
     \]

3. **Find out how many more bananas Jamal has compared to apples:**
   - The problem states that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
     \[
     \text{Difference between bananas and apples} = 44 - 44 = 0
     \]

4. **Sum up all the fruits:**
   - Add up all the fruits (apples and bananas) for both Andrea and Jamal.
     \[
     \text{Total fruits} = (\text{Apples} + \text{Bananas})_{\text{Andrea}} + (\text{Apples} + \text{Bananas})_{\text{Jamal}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fruits} = (52 + 22) + (52 + 22)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fruits} = 74 + 74 = 148

     \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{\text{Total flour}}{\text{Number of cookies}} = \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}}
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for today's cookies:**
   - Today, Carla is making 36 cookies.
   - Using the amount of flour per cookie calculated above:
     \[
     \text{Total flour for today} = \text{Flour per cookie} \times \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup} \times 36
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total flour for today} = 3 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for tomorrow’s cookies:**
   - Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies.
   - Using the amount of flour per cookie calculated above:
     \[
     \text{Total flour for tomorrow} = \text{Flour per cookie} \times \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup} \times 30
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total flour for tomorrow} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total amounts of flour needed for today and tomorrow:**
   - Adding the amounts calculated for today and tomorrow:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = \text{Total flour for today} + \text{Total flour for tomorrow} = 3 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups}
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total flour needed} = 8 \text{ cups}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Carla needs a total of 8 cups of flour to bake all the cookies on both today and tomorrow.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8 \text{ cups}}
\]<|im_end|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pennies in the stack:**
   - The total number of pennies in the cup is 9,300.
   - We need to find out how many pennies are in the stack, which is two-thirds of the total pennies.

2. **Perform the calculation for the number of pennies in the stack:**
   \[
   \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
   \]

3. **Simplify the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 6,200
   \]

4. **Convert the number of pennies in the stack to dollars:**
   - Since there are 100 pennies in one dollar, we divide the number of pennies in the stack by 100 to get the total value in dollars.
   \[
   \text{Total dollars in the stack} = \frac{6,200}{100}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{6,200}{100} = 62

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles Maddison initially has:**
   - Maddison has 5 boxes.
   - Each box contains 50 marbles.
   
   So, the total number of marbles = \( 5 \times 50 \).

   Let's do the multiplication:
   \[
   5 \times 50 = 250
   \]

   Therefore, Maddison initially has 250 marbles.

2. **Determine how many marbles Maddison receives from her friend:**
   - Her friend gives her 20 more marbles.

3. **Add the marbles received to the initial amount:**
   - Initial number of marbles = 250.
   - Marbles given by friend = 20.
   
   Now, we add these together:
   \[
   250 + 20 = 270

1. **Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has:**
   - Chris has 6 trees.
   - Ferdinand has half as many trees as Chris.
   \[
   \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{\text{Chris's trees}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the property including the broker's commission and the transfer tax, then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee:**
   - The selling price of the property is $350,000.
   - The brokerage fee rate is 5%.
   
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 350,000 \times 0.05 = 17,500
   \]

2. **Calculate the Transfer Tax:**
   - The selling price of the property is $350,000.
   - The transfer tax rate is 12%.
   
   \[
   \text{Transfer Tax} = 350,000 \times 0.12 = 42,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost Including Fees:**
   - Add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer tax.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 429,500
   \]

4. **Compare the Total Cost to Mrs. Cruz’s Budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz’s budget is $400,000.
   - Calculate how much more she needs to spend than her budget.
   
   \[
   \text{Additional Amount Needed} = 429,500 - 400,000 = 29,500
   \]

### Conclusion:
Mrs. Cruz needs an additional $29,500 to buy the property. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{29500}
\]<|im_end|>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate all expenses related to the sale, including the transfer fees and the brokerage fee, then subtract these costs from the total selling price.

1. **Calculate the Transfer Fees:**
   - The transfer fee is 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling Price = $400,000
   - Transfer Fee Amount = 3% of $400,000 = 0.03 * $400,000 = $12,000

2. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Selling Price = $400,000
   - Brokerage Fee Amount = 5% of $400,000 = 0.05 * $400,000 = $20,000

3. **Total Expenses (Transfer + Brokerage):**
   - Total Transfer + Brokerage Fees = $12,000 (transfer) + $20,000 (brokerage)
   - Total Expenses = $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000

4. **Add the Remaining Loan Amount:**
   - Mr. Tan paid an additional $250,000 on top of the selling price for the remaining loan amount.
   - Net Proceeds from Sale = Selling Price - Total Expenses - Additional Loan Payment
   - Net Proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000

5. **Calculate the Final Net Proceeds:**
   - Net Proceeds = $400,000 - $32,000 - $250,000
   - Net Proceeds = $400,000 - $282,000
   - Net Proceeds = $118,000

**Final Answer:** Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.<|im_end|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.
He paid $400 000 x 5/100 = $20 000 for the brokerage fee.
So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Heating Time**: The oil needs to reach 300 degrees.
   - This process takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating to Desired Temperature (400 Degrees)**: 
   - This process takes 40% more time than the initial heating time.
   
Let's calculate the additional time required for heating to 400 degrees:
- Initial heating time = 20 minutes
- Additional time for heating to 400 degrees = 20 minutes * 40/100 = 8 minutes

So, the total time taken to reach 400 degrees will be:
\[ \text{Total time} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Cooking Time**:
   - Cooking time after reaching 400 degrees is given as 5 minutes less than the initial heating time.
   
Therefore, the cooking time will be:
\[ \text{Cooking time} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

4. **Total Time from Starting Oil to Cooked Chicken**:
   - Start -> Heat to 300 degrees -> Take 20 minutes
   - Then take 40% longer time to heat up to 400 degrees -> Take 28 minutes
   - Finally, take 15 minutes to cook

Adding these times together gives us the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:
\[ \text{Total time} = 20 + 28 + 15 = 63 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 63 minutes.<|im_end|>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for newspaper ads.
- The real estate agent spends $5 on each newspaper ad.
- They buy 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Cost for newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad}
\]

\[
\text{Cost for newspaper ads} = 50 \times \$5 = \$250
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for television ads.
- The real estate agent spends $75 on each television ad.
- They buy 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Cost for television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad}
\]

\[
\text{Cost for television ads} = 15 \times \$75 = \$1125

### Step 3: Add up the costs to find the total amount spent.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Cost for television ads}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$250 + \$1125 = \$1375

Number of golf balls = 16 / 2
Number of golf balls = 8

Step 2: Determine how many blue golf balls there are.
We know that half of the golf balls are blue. So, we calculate the number of blue golf balls as follows:

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many M&M candies Mary bought in total, let's break down the information given:

1. **First Bag:**
   - Contains 300 M&M candies.

2. **Second Bag:**
   - Has 12 more M&M candies than the first bag.
     \[
     300 + 12 = 312 \text{ M&M candies}
     \]

3. **Third Bag:**
   - Only has half the number of M&M candies as the first bag.
     \[
     \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ M&M candies}
     \]

Now, to find the total number of M&M candies Mary got, we add up the candies from all three bags:
\[
300 (first) + 312 (second) + 150 (third) = 762 \text{ M&M candies}
\]

Thus, Mary gets a total of \( \boxed{762} \) M&M candies.<|im_end|>","First Bag:300
Second Bag:300+12=<<300+12=312>>312

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bedrooms per house:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.

2. **Calculate the number of windows per bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.

3. **Calculate the total number of windows for one house:**
   - For one house:
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = \text{Number of bedrooms} \times \text{Windows per bedroom}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

4. **Add the additional windows outside the bedrooms:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows that are not connected to any bedrooms.
   - Since there are two houses:
     \[
     \text{Additional windows} = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses combined:**
   - Total windows from all bedrooms:
     \[
     \text{Total windows from bedrooms} = 2 \times (3 \times 2) = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]
   - Add the additional windows:
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = 12 + 8 = 20
     \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is {The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms
So each house has 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 windows

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased**

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Package of pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts together.

\[
4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 14.00
\]

So, the total amount spent on the items is $14.00.

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid**

The mother paid $20.00 in total.

Change received = Amount paid - Total cost

\[
20.00 - 14.00 = 6.00
\]

Therefore, the cashier gives back $6.00 as change.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** The cashier gives back **$6.00**.<|im_end|>","The total shopping cost is $4.2 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $<<4.2+9.45+1.35=15>>15.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of stitches in the sweater:**
   - We know the total number of stitches for the entire sweater is 1800.

2. **Stitches used for the collar:**
   - The collar takes up one-tenth of the total number of stitches.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the collar = \( \frac{1}{10} \times 1800 \).

3. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   - \( \frac{1}{10} \times 1800 = 180 \) stitches.

4. **Stitches remaining after the collar:**
   - Subtract the collar stitches from the total number of stitches.
   - Stitches left = Total stitches - Collar stitches = 1800 - 180 = 1620 stitches.

5. **Stitches used for the rosette:**
   - The rosette uses twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the rosette = \( 2 \times 180 \).

6. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   - \( 2 \times 180 = 360 \) stitches.

7. **Stitches remaining after the collar and the rosette:**
   - Subtract both the collar and the rosette stitches from the total number of stitches.
   - Stitches left = Total stitches - (Collar + Rosette) stitches = 1800 - (180 + 360).

8. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve:**
   - Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2.
   - Number of stitches per sleeve = \( \frac{1620}{2} \).

9. **Final calculation:**
   - \( \frac{1620}{2} = 810 \) stitches per sleeve.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 810 stitches.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 810.<|im_end|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds.

1. **Calculate the cost of tomato seeds:**
   - Number of packets of tomato seeds = 20
   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds = $40
   - Total cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = \$800
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of celery seeds:**
   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80
   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30
   - Total cost of celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
     \[
     \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = \$2400
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all seeds:**
   - Total cost of tomato seeds + Total cost of celery seeds
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \$800 + \$2400 = \$3200

To determine how many lines Sean needs to memorize, we need to break down the information provided and calculate accordingly.

1. **Calculate the total number of lines in the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the solo song.
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.

2. **Determine the number of lines from the first scene that belong to Sean:**
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the first scene are his.
   - So, he has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 108 = 96 \) lines from the first scene.

3. **Calculate the number of lines in the second scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.

4. **Determine the number of lines from the second scene that belong to Sean:**
   - Three-fifths of the lines in the second scene are his (since they represent three out of every five lines).
   - So, he has \( \frac{3}{5} \times 60 = 36 \) lines from the second scene.

5. **Add up all the lines Sean needs to memorize:**
   - Lines from the first scene: 96
   - Lines from the second scene: 36
   - Total lines: \(96 + 36 = 132\)

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cards have the letter 'A' on them.
2. Subtract those from the total number of cards to find out how many remain.
3. Calculate how many of the remaining cards have the letter 'B'.
4. Calculate how many of the remaining cards have the letter 'C'.
5. Subtract the number of cards with letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' from the remaining cards to find out how many have the letter 'D'.

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Determine how many cards have the letter 'A' on them.
Carly has 80 cards, and \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them have the letter 'A'. 
\[ \text{Number of cards with 'A'} = 80 \times \frac{2}{5} = 32 \]

### Step 2: Subtract those from the total number of cards to find out how many remain.
\[ \text{Remaining cards after 'A'} = 80 - 32 = 48 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many of the remaining cards have the letter 'B'.
\( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards have the letter 'B'.
\[ \text{Number of cards with 'B'} = 48 \times \frac{1}{2} = 24 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many of the remaining cards have the letter 'C'.
\( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards have the letter 'C'.
\[ \text{Number of cards with 'C'} = 48 \times \frac{5}{8} = 30 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the number of cards with letters 'A', 'B', and 'C' from the remaining cards to find out how many have the letter 'D'.
\[ \text{Number of cards with 'D'} = 48 - (32 + 24 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Number of cards with 'D'} = 48 - 86 \]
This calculation results in a negative value, which indicates that there is an error in the interpretation or calculations. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement for any potential misinterpretations.

Upon reviewing the problem again, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the distribution of letters. Given the constraints provided, let's assume the correct interpretation should lead us to a logical conclusion without negative values.

Given the constraints and ensuring all steps logically align with the problem requirements, let's re-evaluate:

Since the problem states ""and the others"" having the letter D, and considering the fractions given, the correct approach would be to calculate based on the initial percentages provided correctly but ensure the logic aligns with the constraints.

Revising the steps:

1. Calculate the number of cards with 'A': 32.
2. Remaining cards after 'A': 48.
3. Calculate the number of cards with 'B': 24.
4. Calculate the number of cards with 'C': 30.
5. Number of cards with 'D': Remaining after accounting for 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

After recalculating with the correct understanding:

\[ \text{Number of cards with 'D'} = 48 - (32 + 24 + 30) \]
This still leads to a negative value, indicating a potential oversight in the original interpretation.

Given the problem constraints and ensuring logical consistency, the correct interpretation should lead to a non-negative number for the final count of cards with the letter 'D'. Let's reassess the problem constraints and ensure they logically align with the solution.

Given the problem constraints and ensuring logical consistency, the correct interpretation should lead to a non-negative number for the final count of cards with the letter 'D'. The correct answer should be:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes Matthew to dig both small and large holes, then multiply those times by the number of holes he needs to dig.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the time to dig one small hole:**
   - Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes

2. **Calculate the time to dig one large hole:**
   - Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes

3. **Calculate the total time to dig all 30 small holes:**
   - Number of small holes = 30
   - Total time for small holes = \( 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes} \)
     \[
     3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time to dig all 15 large holes:**
   - Number of large holes = 15
   - Total time for large holes = \( 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes} \)
     \[
     10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Add the time for small and large holes together:**
   - Total time for small holes = 90 minutes
   - Total time for large holes = 150 minutes
   - Combined total time = \( 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} \)
     \[
     90 + 150 = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the combined total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \( \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \)
     \[
     \frac{240}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
It will take Matthew **4** hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.<|im_end|>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Mico and Marco, then calculate their combined age after 10 years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent Mico's current age.
   Let \( y \) represent Marco's current age.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20. This can be written as:
   \[
   x + y = 20
   \]

3. **Solve for One Variable in Terms of the Other:**
   We can express one variable in terms of the other. For example, let's express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

4. **Calculate Their Ages After 10 Years:**
   In 10 years, Mico’s age will be \( x + 10 \), and Marco’s age will be \( y + 10 \).

5. **Sum of Their Ages After 10 Years:**
   The total sum of their ages after 10 years will be:
   \[
   (x + 10) + (y + 10)
   \]
   Substitute \( y \) from the previous step into this equation:
   \[
   (x + 10) + ((20 - x) + 10)
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   (x + 10) + (30 - x)
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[

                    question:
                    Ruby is . 6 times older : than Sam. , In : 9 years, . Ruby will be 3 , times as . old as Sam. How old is Sam now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine Sam's current age given that he is 0.6 times as old as Ruby and that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.
   Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Ruby is currently 0.6 times as old as Sam: 
     \[
     R = 0.6S
     \]

   - In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
     \[
     R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
     \]

3. **Substitute \( R \) from Equation (1) into Equation (2):**
   Substitute \( R = 0.6S \) into \( R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \):
   \[
   0.6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

4. **Expand and Simplify:**
   Expand the right side of the equation:
   \[
   0.6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
   
5. **Isolate Terms Containing \( S \):**
   Subtract \( 0.6S \) from both sides:
   \[
   9 = 2.4S + 27
   \]

6. **Solve for \( S \):**
   Subtract 27 from both sides:
   \[
   9 - 27 = 2.4S
   \]
   \[
   -18 = 2.4S
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2.4:
   \[
   S = \frac{-18}{2.4}
   \]
   \[
   S = -\frac{18}{2.4} = -7.5
   \]

### Final Answer:
Sam's current age is \( \boxed{7.5} \).<|im_end|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both the popsicles and the ice cream bars separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles
- Number of popsicles = 20
- Cost per popsicle = $0.25

\[
\text{Total cost for popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Cost per popsicle}
\]

\[
= 20 \times 0.25
\]

\[
= 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars
- Number of ice cream bars = 4
- Cost per ice cream bar = $0.50

\[
\text{Total cost for ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Cost per ice cream bar}
\]

\[
= 4 \times 0.50
\]

\[
= 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the costs from both items
\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost for popsicles} + \text{Total cost for ice cream bars}
\]

\[
= 5 + 2
\]

\[
= 7 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationship between the cobra and the mamba:**
   - We know that a cobra has 70 spots.
   - The cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.

2. **Calculate the number of spots on one mamba:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of spots on one mamba.
   - According to the given information, \( 70 = 2x \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{70}{2} = 35
     \]
   So, each mamba has 35 spots.

3. **Determine the total number of spots among the cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - Total spots from the cobras:
     \[
     40 \times 70 = 2800
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of spots among the mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   - Total spots from the mambas:
     \[
     60 \times 35 = 2100
     \]

5. **Combine the total spots from both the cobras and the mambas:**
   \[
   2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

6. **Find half the total number of spots:**
   - Half of 4900:
     \[
     \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the event**

- **Team Members**: 12
- **Coaches**: 3
- **Guests per Team Member**: 2

First, calculate the total number of guest guests brought to the event:
\[ \text{Total Guests} = \text{Number of Guest Guests per Team Member} \times \text{Number of Team Members} \]
\[ \text{Total Guests} = 2 \times 12 \]

Next, add all these numbers together (team members, coaches, and guests) to get the total number of people at the event.

**Step 2: Determine the number of pizzas needed**

- **Number of Pizzas Needed**: 3

Since we know that one pizza serves 3 people, divide the total number of people by the number of servings per pizza to determine how many pizzas are required.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

- **Cost per Pizza**: $15

Finally, multiply the total number of pizzas by the cost per pizza to find out how much Maddy will spend in total.

Let's perform the calculations:

**Step 1 Calculation**
\[ \text{Total Guests} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

**Step 2 Calculation**
\[ \text{Total Number of People} = \text{Team Members} + \text{Coaches} + \text{Total Guests} \]
\[ \text{Total Number of People} = 12 + 3 + 24 = 40 \]

**Step 3 Calculation**
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Pizzas} \times \text{Cost per Pizza} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times 15 = \$45 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend a total of $45 on the pizzas. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $45.<|im_end|>","Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of topaz gemstones in each necklace:**
   - Each necklace contains 8 topaz gemstones.

2. **Calculate the total length of all topaz gemstones in the necklace:**
   - Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, the total length for 8 gemstones is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches.

3. **Subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total necklace length:**
   - The remaining length after accounting for the topaz gemstones is \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches.

4. **Determine the length of each sterling silver bead:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an inch long.

5. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed to fill the remaining space:**
   - To find out how many beads fit into the remaining 17 inches, divide the remaining length by the length of one bead.
     \[
     \text{Number of beads} = \frac{17}{\frac{1}{4}} = 17 \times 4 = 68

   - We know that Ann is 9 years old.
   - Her brother is twice as old as Ann.
   
2. **Calculate the brother's current age:**
   - Since Ann's brother is twice her age, we multiply Ann's age by 2.

<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rows of 5 stars are present in the 76-star flag. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of stars.
- There are 3 rows of 8 stars.
- There are 2 rows of 6 stars.

Total number of stars = (Number of stars in first row * Number of rows) + (Number of stars in second row * Number of rows)

\[ \text{Total stars} = (8 \times 3) + (6 \times 2) \]

Calculate \( 8 \times 3 \):
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Calculate \( 6 \times 2 \):
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Add these together to get the total number of stars:
\[ \text{Total stars} = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of rows for each star count.

We already know that there are 3 rows of 8 stars and 2 rows of 6 stars. Now let's find out how many more rows there are for the remaining stars.

Since there are 36 stars in total, subtracting the stars from the known rows gives us:
\[ 36 - (8 \times 3) - (6 \times 2) = 0 \]

This means all stars must be accounted for within the existing rows.

### Conclusion:
There are no additional rows of 5 stars needed because the flag already uses up all its stars within the specified configurations.

                    question:
                    A landscaping : company , is delivering flagstones to a customer’s ? yard. ; Each flagstone weighs 75 , pounds. If ? the : delivery trucks ; can carry ? a total , weight of 2000 pounds, how ! many trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in ! one trip?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many delivery trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   - Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   - Total number of flagstones = 80.

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trucks are required to deliver this weight:**
   - Each truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds.

   To find out how many trucks are needed, divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Capacity per truck}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds per truck}}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000} = 3
   \]

4. **Verify that the calculation makes sense:**
   - We calculated that each truck carries 2000 pounds.
   - With 3 trucks, they would collectively carry \(3 \times 2000 = 6000\) pounds.

Since 6000 pounds exactly matches our total weight of 80 flagstones (each weighing 75 pounds), it confirms that three trucks are sufficient.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 3 trucks.<|im_end|>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.
Thus, the landscaping company will need 6000 / 2000 = <<6000/2000=3>>3 trucks to transport the flagstones in one trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane:**
   - The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The car in the slow lane travels at half that speed.
   - Therefore, the speed of the slow lane car = \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles:**
   - Distance = 480 miles.
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour.
   - Time = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).
   - So, the time taken by the car in the fast lane = \(\frac{480}{60}\) hours = 8 hours.

3. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance (480 miles):**
   - Since we know the car in the slow lane travels at 30 miles per hour, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - For the car in the slow lane, the time taken would be:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480}{30}
     \]

4. **Simplify the expression for the time taken by the car in the slow lane:**
   - \(\frac{480}{30} = 16\) hours.

Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles is 16 hours.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 16 hours.<|im_end|>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( A \) represent the number of medals Ali has won.
Let \( I \) represent the number of medals Izzy has won.

From the information provided:
- Ali has won 22 medals (\( A = 22 \)).
- Izzy has won 5 fewer medals than Ali (\( I = A - 5 \)).

### Step 2: Calculate Izzy's Medals
Substitute \( A \) into the equation for Izzy's medals:
\[ I = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

So, Izzy has won 17 medals.

### Step 3: Determine Total Medals Won Together
Together, they have won:
\[ A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

### Step 4: Determine Total Medals Given Out
We know that together they have received 10 times more medals than were given out. Let \( X \) be the total number of medals given out.

According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ X = 10X \]

Since the total medals won (39) must equal 10 times the total medals given out, we set up the equation:
\[ 39 = 10X \]

Solving for \( X \):
\[ X = \frac{39}{10} = 3.9 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is 3.9.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{3.9}

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of chocolate bars:**
   - There are 8 packets.
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   - Total number of chocolate bars = \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \).

2. **Number of chocolate bars for adults:**
   - There are 4 adults.
   - Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
   - Total number of chocolate bars for adults = \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

3. **Chocolate bars left for children:**
   - Total chocolate bars available = 40.
   - Chocolate bars given to adults = 24.
   - Remaining chocolate bars for children = \( 40 - 24 = 16 \).

4. **Number of children:**
   - Number of children = 8.

5. **Equal distribution of remaining chocolate bars among children:**
   - We need to divide the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children.
   - Each child will get \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \) chocolate bars.

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer:** Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.<|im_end|>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Susan spends working on her online task and then calculate her earnings based on that time.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total available time:**
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
   - The total time available is \(11 \text{ a.m} - 8 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Convert the total time into minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the time spent pausing:**
   - Susan takes a break for half an hour (which is 30 minutes).

4. **Subtract the paused time from the total time:**
   - Time spent working = Total time - Pause time
   - Time spent working = \(180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}\).

5. **Convert the work time back into minutes:**
   - We previously converted the total time to be in minutes; now we convert the work time back to minutes.
   - Work time = 150 minutes.

6. **Calculate the number of tasks completed:**
   - Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes.
   - Number of tasks completed = \(\frac{\text{Work time}}{10} = \frac{150}{10} = 15\).

7. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Number of tasks * Earnings per task
   - Total earnings = \(15 \times 5 = \$75\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]<|im_end|>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Jim's Points
- **Mike**: 21 points
- **Jim**: 3 points less than Mike.
  
  \[
  \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Tony's Points
- **Tony**: Twice as much as Mike.
  
  \[
  \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
  \]

### Step 3: Distribute Extra Points in the Fourth Round
- Each player receives one extra point if their current score exceeds 20 points.
- Since all scores exceed 20 (21 for Mike, 18 for Jim, 42 for Tony), everyone will receive one extra point.

### Step 4: Add the Extra Points to Scores
- **Mike**:
  \[
  21 + 1 = 22
  \]
- **Jim**:
  \[
  18 + 1 = 19
  \]
- **Tony**:
  \[
  42 + 1 = 43
  \]

### Step 5: Sum All Points Together

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges
Will bought 15 oranges.

### Step 2: Calculate how many oranges the oldest son should wash
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- He has two sons in total (including himself).

Since there are 2 sons, we need to determine how many oranges one son would have if he were only one year old.

### Step 3: Calculate how many oranges the second son should wash
- If the oldest son was only one year old, then the second son would be half that age, which is 4 years old.

So, the second son should wash \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the oranges because he is younger than the oldest son but still older than zero.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of oranges washed by the oldest son
- Since the oldest son is 8 years old, he will wash all 15 oranges.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of oranges washed by the second son
- The second son is 4 years old, so he will wash \( \frac{1}{2} \times 15 = 7.5 \) oranges.

However, since you can't wash half an orange, we round down to 7 oranges.

### Step 6: Subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges
- Total oranges - oranges washed by the oldest son = \( 15 - 15 = 0 \)

- Total oranges - oranges washed by the second son = \( 15 - 7 = 8 \)

Therefore, after both sons wash their respective amounts of oranges, there will be **8** oranges left unwashed.<|im_end|>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and calculate the total number of activities performed over the two days.

### Step 1: Calculate Pushup Activities
- **First Day**: 
  - Pushups = 100

- **Second Day**:
  - Pushups = First Day Pushups + Additional Pushups  
    = 100 + (100 + 20) = 120

### Step 2: Calculate Squat Activities
- **First Day**:
  - Squats = 50

- **Second Day**:
  - Squats = First Day Squats - Decrease in Squats  
    = 50 - 10 = 40

### Step 3: Calculate Dumbbell Press Activities
- **First Day**:
  - Dumbbell Presses = 20

- **Second Day**:
  - Dumbbell Presses = First Day Dumbbell Presses * Doubling Factor  
    = 20 * 2 = 40

### Step 4: Sum Up All Activities
- **Pushups Total** = First Day Pushups + Second Day Pushups  
  = 100 + 120 = 220

- **Squats Total** = First Day Squats + Second Day Squats  
  = 50 + 40 = 90

- **Dumbbell Presses Total** = First Day Dumbbell Presses + Second Day Dumbbell Presses  
  = 20 + 40 = 60

### Final Calculation
- **Total Count of Activities** = Pushups + Squats + Dumbbell Presses

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount of rice consumed per day:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are 5 meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   - Therefore, the daily consumption for one person is \( 0.2 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 0.4 \text{ kg/day} \).

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption for all members of the household:**
   - Since there are 5 members, the total daily consumption is \( 0.4 \text{ kg/person} \times 5 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \).

3. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**
   - The weekly consumption is \( 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \).

4. **Determine how long the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - If the household consumes 14 kg of rice per week, then the number of weeks the 42 kg bag will last is \( \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \).

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

                    ? Sam sells bread. He has ; a . target ; of selling 120 crates , of bread in : a , week. One week he was ? closed on Monday and Friday. Over the weekend he sold 20 crates. : On : Tuesday he sold . 15 crates, on Wednesday 12 crates, ; and Thursday 18 ! crates. ; By how many crates was Sam . off from ! his target , for the week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days in the week.
A standard workweek consists of 7 days.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of working days in the week.
- There are no closed days (Monday and Friday).
- Therefore, we have 6 working days (Tuesday to Sunday).

### Step 3: Calculate the total sales over the weekend.
- The weekend sales include Saturday and Sunday.
- Sales on Saturday = 20 crates
- Sales on Sunday = 20 crates
- Total weekend sales = 20 + 20 = 40 crates

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining sales after the weekend.
- Total target sales = 120 crates
- Weekend sales = 40 crates
- Remaining sales = 120 - 40 = 80 crates

### Step 5: Calculate the sales for the rest of the day excluding the weekend.
- Sales on Tuesday = 15 crates
- Sales on Wednesday = 12 crates
- Sales on Thursday = 18 crates
- Total sales for these three days = 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates

### Step 6: Calculate the difference between the actual sales and the target sales.
- Target sales = 120 crates
- Actual sales (excluding the weekend) = 45 crates
- Difference = 120 - 45 = 75 crates

Therefore, Sam was **off** from his target by **75 crates** for the week.<|im_end|>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.
Sam was off his target by 120 - 65 = <<120-65=55>>55 crates.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much John pays annually for driving services, let's break down the costs into two parts: the cost per trip and the total annual cost.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the daily mileage**: 
   - John drives to work (30 miles) and back home.
   - Total daily distance = 30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles.

2. **Calculate the weekly mileage**:
   - John works 5 days a week.
   - Weekly mileage = 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles/week.

3. **Calculate the monthly mileage**:
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly mileage = 300 miles/week * 4 weeks/month = 1200 miles/month.

4. **Calculate the yearly mileage**:
   - John works 50 weeks a year.
   - Yearly mileage = 1200 miles/month * 50 months/year = 60,000 miles/year.

5. **Calculate the total cost based on the mileage**:
   - The cost per mile driven is $2.
   - Total cost for all miles driven = 60,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $120,000/year.

6. **Add the bonus amount**:
   - John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
   - Total monthly bonus = $150/month.
   - Total annual bonus = $150/month * 12 months/year = $1800/year.

7. **Sum up the total cost**:
   - Total annual cost = Cost for driving + Bonus
   - Total annual cost = $120,000/year + $1800/year = $121,800/year.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} $121,800/year.<|im_end|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Peter should exercise on Tuesday based on the information provided.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday combined**

- On Monday, Peter exercised for **16** minutes.
- On Sunday, Peter exercised for **23** minutes.

Total time on Monday and Sunday combined:
\[ 16 + 23 = 49 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday**

According to the problem, on Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for **twice the amount of time** he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined.

So, if \( x \) represents the time he exercises on Tuesday, then:
\[ x = 2 \times (16 + 23) \]
\[ x = 2 \times 49 \]
\[ x = 98 \text{ minutes} \]

**Final Answer**

To determine how many pieces of paper are used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the steps involved in creating such an object.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Paper Setup:**
   - We start with one sheet of paper.

2. **First Fold:**
   - Fold the paper vertically along its length.
   - This creates two equal halves (two pieces).

3. **Printing Process:**
   - The first half is printed as page 1.
   - The second half is not printed yet.

4. **Second Fold:**
   - Fold the remaining half horizontally across its width.
   - This creates four smaller pieces from the original two, resulting in eight total pieces.

5. **Printing Process:**
   - The first quarter (from the top) is printed as page 1.
   - The second quarter (from the bottom) is not printed yet.

6. **Third Fold:**
   - Fold the remaining three quarters into thirds.
   - This results in twelve pieces.

7. **Printing Process:**
   - The first eighth (from the top-left corner) is printed as page 1.
   - The second eighth (from the middle-left) is printed as page 2.
   - The third eighth (from the top-right corner) is printed as page 3.
   - The fourth eighth (from the middle-right) is printed as page 4.
   - The fifth eighth (from the bottom-left corner) is printed as page 5.
   - The sixth eighth (from the bottom-middle) is printed as page 6.
   - The seventh eighth (from the bottom-right corner) is printed as page 7.
   - The eighth eighth (from the top-middle) is printed as page 8.

8. **Fourth Fold:**
   - Fold the remaining sixths into fifths.
   - This results in twenty-four pieces.

9. **Printing Process:**
   - The ninth piece (top-left) is printed as page 1.
   - The tenth piece (middle-left) is printed as page 2.
   - The eleventh piece (top-right) is printed as page 3.
   - The twelfth piece (bottom-left) is printed as page 4.
   - The thirteenth piece (middle-bottom) is printed as page 5.
   - The fourteenth piece (top-middle) is printed as page 6.
   - The fifteenth piece (bottom-middle) is printed as page 7.
   - The sixteenth piece (bottom-right) is printed as page 8.

10. **Fifth Fold:**
    - Fold the remaining sevenths into eighths.
    - This results in thirty-two pieces.

11. **Printing Process:**
    - The nineteenth piece (top-left) is printed as page 1.
    - The twentieth piece (middle-left) is printed as page 2.
    - The twenty-first piece (top-right) is printed as page 3.
    - The twenty-second piece (bottom-left) is printed as page 4.
    - The twenty-third piece (middle-bottom) is printed as page 5.
    - The twenty-fourth piece (top-middle) is printed as page 6.
    - The twenty-fifth piece (bottom-middle) is printed as page 7.
    - The twenty-sixth piece (bottom-right) is printed as page 8.

   - Amount spent on food = $25.
   
4. **Calculate the total amount spent on food and rides combined:**
   - Food + Rides = $25 + $10 = $35.

5. **Subtract the total amount spent from her initial total to find out how much is left:**

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from all books sold:**
   - Total books = 250
   - Selling price per book = $20
   - Total revenue = 250 * 20 = $5000

2. **Determine how many books were sold in each year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the first year.
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year compared to the current year (3rd year).
     Therefore, \( x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

3. **Calculate the total revenue from books sold over two years:**
   - Revenue from the first year = 90 * 20 = $1800
   - Revenue from the second year = 45 * 20 = $900
   - Total revenue over two years = $1800 + $900 = $2700

4. **Subtract the unsold books from the total revenue:**
   - Number of unsold books = 50
   - Books already sold = 90 + 45 = 135
   - Unsold books after selling = 135 - 50 = 85
   - Money earned from sold books = $2700

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $2700. The final answer is:

{The final answer is} $2700.<|im_end|>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.

The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money Watson made in April when the company performed very well, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings
First, let's calculate how much Watson earns on his daily shift.

- **Hourly Rate**: $10/hour
- **Number of Hours Per Shift**: 10 hours/day

\[
\text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]

\[
\text{Daily Earnings} = \$10 \times 10 = \$100
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Earnings
Next, we calculate how much he earns in one week.

- **Number of Days Worked Per Week**: 5 days/week

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \$100 \times 5 = \$500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Biweekly Earnings (since there are approximately 4 weeks in an April)
Since April typically has about 4 weeks, we can assume Watson works biweekly.

\[
\text{Biweekly Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \frac{\text{Number of Weeks}}{2}
\]

\[
\text{Biweekly Earnings} = \$500 \times \frac{4}{2} = \$500 \times 2 = \$1000
\]

### Step 4: Add the Bonus
Finally, add the weekly bonus to the biweekly earnings since the company performed very well for the entire month.

\[
\text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{Biweekly Earnings} + \text{Bonus}
\]

\[
\text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$1000 + \$300 = \$1300
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Watson made $\boxed{1300}$ dollars in April if the company performed very well for the whole month.<|im_end|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of people who beat him**:
   - John beat 80% of the time.
   - There were 20 people in total.

2. **Calculate how many people beat him**:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who beat him} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate how many people lost to him**:
   - Since there were 20 people in total and 16 beat him,
   - The remaining number will be those who lost to him.
   \[
   \text{Number of people he lost to} = 20 - 16 = 4

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine total loaves produced per day:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate loaves sold in the morning:**
   According to the problem, two-thirds (2/3) of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate remaining loaves after morning sales:**
   Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total production.

   \[
   \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Calculate loaves sold in the afternoon:**
   Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   Check if the remaining loaves before selling in the afternoon match the condition stated in the problem. 

   If we sell half of the remaining loaves in the afternoon, then the afternoon sales should be correct.

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread that are sold in the afternoon is 10.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","60 x 2/3 = <<60*2/3=40>>40 loaves of bread are sold in the morning.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Sandy will lose per week and then calculate how long it will take her to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

1. **Determine the total weight lost by Joey over the given time:**
   - Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
   
2. **Calculate the average weekly weight loss for Joey:**
   \[
   \text{Weight loss per week} = \frac{\text{Total weight lost}}{\text{Number of weeks}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss per week} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

3. **Apply the same rate of weight loss to Sandy:**
   - Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey within a single week.
   - Since Joey's rate is 2 pounds per week, we can assume that Sandy also loses at this rate.

4. **Calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose 8 pounds.
   - We know that:
     \[
     \text{Weight loss per week} = 2 \text{ pounds/week}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds/week} \times x \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - The original price for one tub of ice cream is $13.
   - One tub costs $13.

   So, the total cost for two tubs of ice cream would be:
   \[
   2 \times \$13 = \$26
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost including the discount on the milk packets:**
   - Each packet of milk originally sells for $0.5 but is being sold at a discounted rate.
   - With a 50% discount (since it's described as ""a discount""), the selling price per packet becomes:
     \[
     \$0.5 \times (1 - 0.5) = \$0.5 \times 0.5 = \$0.25
     \]
   
   - For four packets of milk, the total cost before applying the discount is:
     \[
     4 \times \$0.25 = \$1
     \]

3. **Subtract the savings from buying the discounted milk from the total cost for the ice cream:**
   - The savings from buying the discounted milk is:
     \[
     \$1 \text{ (original price)} - \$0.25 \text{ (discounted price per packet)} \times 4 \text{ (number of packets)}
     \]
   - Simplifying that gives:
     \[
     \$1 - (\$0.25 \times 4) = \$1 - \$1 = \$0
     \]

Therefore, you will save nothing in this scenario because the discount on the milk packet perfectly offsets the additional cost of the ice cream. 

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{\$0}
\]<|im_end|>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

You will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional limbs (arms and legs) will be grown after 15 days based on the growth pattern described.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the growth pattern:**
   - An extra arm grows every 3 days.
   - An extra leg grows every 5 days.

2. **Calculate the number of arms grown in 15 days:**
   - Since an extra arm grows every 3 days, we divide 15 by 3.
   \[
   \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, a person will have grown 5 more arms after 15 days.

3. **Calculate the number of legs grown in 15 days:**
   - Since an extra leg grows every 5 days, we divide 15 by 5.
   \[
   \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]
   So, a person will have grown 3 more legs after 15 days.

4. **Sum the total number of new limbs grown:**
   - Add the number of arms and legs together.
   \[
   5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} = 8 \text{ (total limbs)}
   \]

Therefore, after 15 days, a person would grow a total of 8 new limbs from drinking Helena's serum.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]<|im_end|>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on business suits.
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of suits} = 6 \times \$100 = \$600 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on suitcase rentals.
- Theo rents 3 suitcases at $50 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of suitcases} = 3 \times \$50 = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the flight ticket relative to the cost of a business suit.
- The flight ticket costs $700.
- According to the problem, the flight ticket is ""more than 5 times as much as the cost of one business suit.""
\[ \text{Cost of one business suit} = \$100 \]
\[ \text{5 times the cost of one business suit} = 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]

Since $700 > \$500$, the statement about the flight ticket being more than 5 times the cost of a business suit is true.

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining money after spending on suits and suitcases.
- Total initial amount: $6000
- Cost of suits: $600
- Cost of suitcases: $150
\[ \text{Remaining money} = \$6000 - (\$600 + \$150) = \$6000 - \$750 = \$5250 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the savings from the trip from the remaining money.
- Theo wants to save $2000 before the trip.
\[ \text{Money left after saving} = \$5250 - \$2000 = \$3250 \]

### Conclusion:
Theo has $3250 left to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$3250}
\]<|im_end|>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.

Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family over a period of seven days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of eggs eaten per person per day:**
   - Three people eat three eggs.
   - Therefore, each person eats \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \) egg per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten per person per week:**
   - Each person eats 1 egg per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, each person eats \( 1 \times 7 = 7 \) eggs per week.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by all five people per week:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - Each person consumes 7 eggs per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family per week is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \).

4. **Verify the consistency with the given information about eating habits:**
   - According to the problem, the rest of the family (two people) eat two eggs each day.
   - The remaining two people eat one egg each per day.
   - This matches our calculations where each person indeed consumes 1 egg per day.

Therefore, the total number of eggs the family consumes in a week is \(\boxed{35}\).<|im_end|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.

So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

1. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - We know that Cera is currently 46 years old.
   - According to the statement ""Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera,"" we can set up an equation for their ages at that time.
   
2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   Let \( N \) be Noah's age six years ago. Since Noah was half as old then as Cera (who is 46), we have:
   \[
   N = \frac{C}{2}
   \]
   where \( C \) is Cera’s age six years ago. So,
   \[
   N = \frac{46}{2} = 23
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people in Chile six years ago:**
   The statement says that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Therefore, if Noah was 23 years old six years ago, the population was:
   \[
   3000 \times 23 = 69,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   Given that the current population of Chile is twice its six-year-old population:
   \[
   \text{Current Population} = 2 \times 69,000 = 138,000
   \]

5. **Verify the consistency of the data provided:**
   We are told that the population of Chile is half of what it will be in the future. This means that after six years from now, the population should be double the current population:
   \[
   \text{Future Population} = 2 \times 138,000 = 276,000
   \]
   But since the statement does not mention any change in the population over the next six years, we assume the current population is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many players are on the offense, the special teams, and ultimately the defense based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Given Information:
1. The total number of players in the football team is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense.
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams compared to those on the defense.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) = Number of players on the defense.
- \( O \) = Number of players on the offense.
- \( S \) = Number of players on the special teams.

From the given information, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( O = 2D \)
2. \( S = \frac{1}{2}D \)

Since the total number of players is 105, we have:
\[ O + D + S = 105 \]

Substitute \( O \) from the first equation into the total player count equation:
\[ 2D + D + S = 105 \]
\[ 3D + S = 105 \]

Now substitute \( S \) from the second equation into the above equation:
\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{1D}{2} \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ 7D = 210 \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense (\( D \)) is 30.

#### Verification:
- Defense: \( D = 30 \)
- Offense: \( O = 2D = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( S = \frac{1}{2}D = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

                    question:
                    . Martha is ! planning her , Christmas party. She invited 2 families ; with ! 6 people and 3 families , with 4 people. 8 people : couldn't come due to illness, and : 1/4 that . number : had previous ! commitments. How many people show up for Martha's , party?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of invited guests.
- Martha invited two families:
  - Family 1: 6 people
  - Family 2: 4 people

Total number of invited guests = 6 + 4 = 10 guests.

### Step 2: Adjust for those who couldn't attend due to illness.
- According to the problem, 8 people were unable to attend because of illness.

Adjusted total after accounting for those unable to attend (illness): 
\[ 10 \text{ (initial)} - 8 \text{ (illness)} = 2 \text{ guests} \]

### Step 3: Adjust for those who had previous commitments.
- The problem states that one-fourth of the remaining guests had previous commitments.

Number of guests with previous commitments:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5 \]
Since you can't have half a person in this context, let’s round down to the nearest whole number as per typical scenarios where partial people aren’t counted.

So, \(0\) guests had previous commitments.

### Step 4: Subtract the number of guests with previous commitments from the adjusted number of guests.
Final count after subtracting those with previous commitments:
\[ 2 \text{ (after illness)} - 0 \text{ (previous commitments)} = 2 \text{ guests} \]

Therefore, **the final answer is** 2 people.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of people from 6-person families: 2 families * 6 people/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people

Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people
Then subtract the people who couldn't come from the total to find the number who showed up: 24 people - 2 people - 8 people = <<24-2-8=14>>14 people

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon received from Johanna:**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles before adding any more:**
   Solomon already has 20 marbles plus the additional ones he got from the store (which we don't know yet). Let's denote the number of marbles from the store as \( S \).

3. **Add the marbles from the store:**
   The store initially has 50 marbles. After adding the marbles from the store, the total number of marbles becomes \( 20 + S \).

4. **Account for the marbles given by Solomon's father:**
   Solomon's father gives him twice as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since he bought 20 marbles from Johanna, his father gives him \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) marbles.

5. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon now has:**
   Solomon now has \( 20 + S \) marbles plus the 40 marbles from his father, which totals \( 60 + S \) marbles.

6. **Determine the total weight of the marbles:**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all the marbles Solomon has is \( (60 + S) \times 2 \) kg.

7. **Express the total weight in terms of \( S \):**
   The total weight of the marbles Solomon has is \( 2(60 + S) \) kg.

8. **Substitute the value of \( S \) into the equation:**
   We need to find the value of \( S \) first. However, since the problem does not provide a specific value for \( S \), we can express the total weight in terms of \( S \).

Given that Solomon's father gave him 40 marbles, and these were likely part of the initial purchase or given marbles from the store, we can infer that \( S = 40 \).

9. **Calculate the total weight using \( S = 40 \):**
   Substituting \( S = 40 \) into the equation, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is \( 2(60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \) kg.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 200 kg.<|im_end|>","After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.

                    question:
                    . John fills a 6 foot ; by ? 4 foot pool that ; is 5 feet deep.  ; It cost $.1 per cubic foot to fill. .  . How much does it ; cost ; to fill?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The pool has dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = ?
- Depth (D) = 5 feet

We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ \text{Volume} = L \times W \times D \]

Since the width is unknown but needed to find the total volume, let's denote the unknown width as \( W \).

So,
\[ V = L \times W \times D \]
\[ V = 6 \times W \times 5 \]
\[ V = 30W \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of cubic feet required to fill the pool.
Given that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the volume of the pool by the cost per cubic foot.

Let's assume the width \( W \) is known or given in the problem statement. For now, we'll leave \( W \) as an unknown variable since it was not provided in the problem.

If we had the value of \( W \), we could substitute it into the equation above to get the total volume and then multiply by $0.1 to find the total cost.

### Step 3: Solve for the unknown width \( W \).
Without knowing the exact width \( W \), we cannot compute the total volume or the total cost. However, if you provide the actual width, we can proceed.

Assuming we know the width, say \( W = 4 \) feet (as an example):

1. Substitute \( W = 4 \) into the volume formula:
   \[ V = 30 \times 4 \]
   \[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

2. Calculate the total cost by multiplying the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
   \[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times \$0.1 \]
   \[ \text{Total Cost} = \$12 \]

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool would be **$12**.

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We are given that there are 30 boys.

2. **Calculate the number of girls based on the ratio provided:**
   - The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of girls.
   - Given \( G = 3 \times B \), where \( B \) is the number of boys.
   - Substituting \( B = 30 \):
     \[
     G = 3 \times 30 = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 90 girls in the classroom.

3. **Calculate the number of non-gendered children (children who are neither boys nor girls):**
   - The problem also states that there are \(\frac{1}{10}\) as many non-gendered children as there are boys.
   - Let \( N \) represent the number of non-gendered children.
   - Given \( N = \frac{1}{10} \times B \), where \( B \) is the number of boys.
   - Substituting \( B = 30 \):
     \[
     N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 3 non-gendered children.

4. **Calculate the total number of children:**
   - Add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children together.
   - Total number of children = Boys + Girls + Non-gendered Children
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
     \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is \(\boxed{123}\).<|im_end|>","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.

We know that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.

### Step 2: Determine the number of wires based on the given information
According to the problem, the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of poles using the ratio
Given the ratio 1:3, we can set up a proportion where the number of poles (P) is related to the number of wires (W).

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Since \( W = 45 \):

\[ P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45 \]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is **15**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the initial total number of people:**
   - There were initially 25 men.
   - There were also 15 women.
   - Therefore, the total number of people at the beginning is:
     \[
     25 + 15 = 40
     \]

2. **Calculate how many people left after an hour:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left.
   - The total number of people at the beginning was 40, so:
     \[
     \text{Number of people who left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
     \]
   - This means that \( 30 \) people remained at the party (since \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)).

3. **Determine the number of men remaining at the party:**
   - We know that \( 22 \) men stayed at the party.
   - Since \( 25 \) men started, and \( 22 \) stayed, it implies that \( 3 \) men left.
   - Therefore, the number of men remaining at the party is:
     \[
     25 - 3 = 22
     \]

4. **Determine the number of women remaining at the party:**
   - Let's denote the number of women remaining as \( W \).
   - We already know that \( 22 \) men stayed, and since \( 25 \) men started, \( 3 \) men must have left.
   - From the information given, we can infer that the number of women left must be equal to the number of men left because they are part of the same group and did not leave together.
   - So, \( W = 3 \).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]<|im_end|>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.
After an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.
This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.
Out of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes Jam has:**
   - We know that Jam's total number of pencils is 26.
   - Let's denote the number of boxes Jam has as \( J \).
   - Each box contains 3 pencils (since the total is 26 pencils in boxes plus 2 loose pencils).

   Therefore, if each box contains 3 pencils, then the total number of pencils in boxes can be represented as \( 3J \).

   So,
   \[
   3J = 26
   \]

2. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - To find out how many boxes Jam has, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   J = \frac{26}{3}
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   J = 8.67
   \]
   Since the number of boxes must be an integer, we round up because even one more box would exceed the total number of pencils.

   Thus, Jam has 9 boxes.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes Meg has:**
   - Meg has a total of 46 pencils.
   - Each box contains 3 pencils, so let's determine how many boxes Meg needs.

   The number of boxes Meg needs is calculated by dividing her total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes Meg needs} = \frac{46}{3}
   \]
   - Simplifying this division gives:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes Meg needs} = 15.33
   \]
   Again, since the number of boxes must be an integer, we round up because even one more box would exceed the total number of pencils.

   Thus, Meg also needs 16 boxes.

4. **Summarize the results:**
   - Jam has 9 boxes.
   - Meg has 16 boxes.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jam and Meg together need 25 boxes to store all their pencils.<|im_end|>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

Therefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes after being cooled and then mixed with cream.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the cooling effect on the coffee:**
   - Each ice cube cools the coffee by \(13\) degrees.
   - Shannon has \(15\) milliliters of cream added to her coffee.
   
2. **Calculate the total temperature decrease due to the cream alone:**
   - The temperature decrease caused by the cream is given as \(12\) milliliters.

3. **Combine the effects of cooling from both sources (ice and cream):**
   - Since the coffee is cooled by \(13\) degrees per ice cube and there are \(15\) ice cubes,
     \[
     \text{Total temperature decrease} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ degrees}
     \]
   - However, since only \(12\) milliliters of cream causes this temperature decrease, the effective temperature increase due to the cream is \(12\) degrees.

4. **Calculate the weakening factor based on the temperature change:**
   - The coffee loses strength in proportion to the temperature decrease.
   - If the coffee loses \(12\) milliliters of strength for every \(10\) degrees Celsius decrease in temperature,
     \[
     \text{Weakening factor} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2
     \]

5. **Calculate the new strength of the coffee after cooling:**
   - Initially, the coffee has a certain strength, let's denote its initial strength as \(S\).
   - After losing \(12\) milliliters of strength due to the temperature decrease,
     \[
     S_{\text{new}} = S - 12
     \]

6. **Determine the final strength of the coffee after mixing with the cream:**
   - The final strength of the coffee is now reduced by the weakening factor calculated earlier,
     \[
     S_{\text{final}} = S_{\text{new}} \times \text{Weakening factor} = (S - 12) \times 1.2
     \]

7. **Substitute the value of \(S\) back into the equation:**
   - To find the exact value, we would need the initial strength \(S\). But without knowing the initial strength, we can express the final strength in terms of \(S\),
     \[
     S_{\text{final}} = (S - 12) \times 1.2
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**

Since the problem does not provide the initial strength of the coffee, we cannot calculate the exact numerical difference in strength. Therefore, the final answer should indicate that the coffee remains weaker by a factor of \(1.2\) compared to its original strength.

**The final answer is:** The coffee is weakened by a factor of \(1.2\), meaning it retains only \(120\%\) of its original strength.<|im_end|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

                    question:
                    Ralph has a record , store where people can trade their own ! records ? for new ones. People can trade ? 2 old records for 1 : new ! one. 5 . people ; come ; in with : old records and leave ; with 7 new records ? between them. How ! many old ; records did : the 5 people bring in?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many old records the five individuals brought into the store based on the trading rules provided.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Trading Rule
- **Rule**: For every two old records traded, you receive one new record.
- **Total Records Given**: Five people (total) trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
  
### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We denote:
- \( x \): number of old records each person brings in.
- \( y \): total number of old records brought in by all five people combined.

Given that each person trades 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by everyone is:
\[ 5x = y \]

This equation represents the total number of old records as the sum of the individual contributions from each person.

### Step 3: Use the Trade Rule
According to the rule, for every pair of old records traded, one new record is received. Since there are 5 people, they will trade:
\[ \frac{5}{2} \] pairs of old records (since each person trades 2 records).

Since each pair results in 1 new record being obtained, the number of new records received must be equal to the number of pairs traded:
\[ \frac{5}{2} \times 1 = \frac{5}{2} \]
So, the total number of new records received should also be:
\[ \frac{5}{2} \]

### Step 4: Solve for Old Records
Now, using the relationship between the total number of old records (\( y \)) and the total number of new records (\( \frac{5}{2} \)), we have:
\[ y = \frac{5}{2} \]

Since \( y \) represents the total number of old records brought in by all five people, it equals:
\[ y = \frac{5}{2} \]

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of old records brought in by the five people is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{2}}
\]<|im_end|>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( J \) be the number of Junior programmers.

Given that Junior programmers make up \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees (which is 100), we can set up an equation to find \( J \):
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = J \]

Calculating this:
\[ J = 40 \]

So, there are 40 Junior programmers.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Senior Programmers
Since the number of senior programmers is given as \( S \), and we know the total number of employees is 100:
\[ S + J = 100 \]
Substituting \( J \) from above:
\[ S + 40 = 100 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 60 \]

There are 60 senior programmers.

### Step 3: Determine the Pay Rates
- Junior programmers' pay rate is $2000 per month.
- Senior programmers' pay rate is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.

### Step 4: Calculate Total Payments
- **Junior Programmers**:
  - There are 40 Junior programmers.
  - Each gets $2000 per month.
  
  So, total payment for Junior programmers:
  \[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

- **Senior Programmers**:
  - There are 60 Senior programmers.
  - Each gets $2400 per month.
  
  So, total payment for Senior programmers:
  \[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

### Step 5: Sum Up All Payments
- Total payment to all programmers:
  \[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $\boxed{224000}$.<|im_end|>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people boarded the bus at the terminal given that there were a total of 20 people when it reached the third stop.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of passengers**:
   - We start with an unknown number of passengers at the terminal (let's call this \( P \)).

2. **First stop**:
   - At the first bus stop, 5 more people board the bus.
   - After the first stop, the total number of passengers is \( P + 5 \).

3. **Second stop**:
   - At the second bus stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on.
   - After the second stop, the total number of passengers is \( (P + 5) - 7 + 8 = P + 6 \).

4. **Third stop**:
   - The total number of passengers before reaching the third stop is 20.
   - So, after getting off some people at the third stop, the number of passengers remains 20.

Since the number of passengers at the terminal was initially \( P \), and after the second stop, the number of passengers became \( P + 6 \), which equals 20 (the total number of passengers at the third stop), we can set up the equation:
\[ P + 6 = 20 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 20 - 6 \]
\[ P = 14 \]

Therefore, the initial number of passengers at the terminal is 14.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 14.<|im_end|>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Initial number of lollipops
Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

### Step 2: Lollipops eaten during the day
Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.

\[ \text{Lollipops after eating} = 24 - 2 = 22 \]

### Step 3: Lollipops passed out
Oscar passes lollipops to his friends. Let's assume he passes \( x \) lollipops to his friends.

After passing out the lollipops, Oscar will have:
\[ \text{Lollipops after passing out} = 22 - x \]

### Step 4: Lollipops bought for return trip
On his way back home, Oscar buys twice as many lollipops as those given to his friends. Since he passed out \( x \) lollipops, he buys \( 2x \) lollipops.

Since he ate 2 lollipops on his way to school, he must have eaten some from his purchases too. We need to find out how many lollipops he had before buying them so he can account for both the ones he ate and the ones he bought.

Let's denote the total number of lollipops Oscar has at any point as \( T \).

From the above information, we know:
\[ T = 22 + (2x) \]

But since he ate 2 lollipops on his way to school, he must have started with:
\[ T = 22 + (2x) \]
and he ended up with:
\[ T = 20 \]

So, we can conclude:
\[ 22 + (2x) = 20 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ 22 + 2x = 20 \]
\[ 2x = 20 - 22 \]
\[ 2x = -2 \]
This doesn't make sense because the number of lollipops cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

### Correct Approach:
We should consider the total number of lollipops Oscar has at the end of the day, which includes what he bought on the way home. 

At the start, Oscar has 24 lollipops.
He eats 2 on the way to school, leaving him with:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]

He then passes out lollipops to his friends. Let’s say he gives away \( x \) lollipops. After giving these away, he will have:
\[ 22 - x \]

Then, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. So he buys \( 2x \) lollipops. Therefore, he ends up with:
\[ 22 - x + 2x = 22 + x \]

Given that he ends up with 20 lollipops after all these transactions, we get:
\[ 22 + x = 20 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 20 - 22 \]
\[ x = -2 \]

Again, this doesn't make sense. Let's reconsider the logic:

If Oscar ends up with 20 lollipops after all, he must have started with:
\[ T = 22 + (2x) \]
And if he ends up with 20 lollipops, he must have bought enough lollipops to cover his consumption and the ones he gave away.

Given that he ends up with 20 lollipops after all, let's correct our understanding:

### Final Calculation:
Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
He eats 2 on the way to school, leaving him with:
\[ 24 - 2 = 22 \]

He then buys twice as many lollipops as he gave away. If he ends up with 20 lollipops after all, he must have given away:
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, he bought:
\[ 2x = 2 * 2 = 4 \]

After giving away 2 lollipops and buying 4 more, he ends up with:
\[ 22 - 2 + 4 = 24 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the phone to fully charge given its charging rate. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Charging Rate
- The phone charges at a rate of **1 percentage point** every **3 minutes**.

### Step 2: Convert Percentage Points to Minutes
Since 1 percentage point means 1%, and there are 100 percentage points in total, we can convert percentages to minutes based on the charging rate.

- For every 1 percentage point, the battery increases by **1/100 = 0.01** (since 1/100 = 0.01).

- Therefore, for 1 percentage point increase, the time taken is **3 minutes**.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Time to Charge Fully
- To fully charge the phone, which has an initial charge of **60%**, we need to calculate the number of percentage points required.
  
  - Initial charge = **60%**
  - Full charge = **100%**

- Number of percentage points needed = **100% - 60% = 40%**

### Step 4: Determine the Charging Time for Each Percentage Point
- Since 1 percentage point takes **3 minutes** to charge,
- 40 percentage points would therefore take **\(40 \times 3\) minutes**.

### Step 5: Perform the Calculation
\[ 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 6: Convert Minutes to Hours
- There are **60 minutes** in one hour.
  
  - Time in hours = \( \frac{120}{60} \) hours = **2 hours**.

### Conclusion
Therefore, it will take **2 hours** to fully charge the phone.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 2 hours.<|im_end|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total reward earned from spending.
- The customer spends $80 in one shopping trip.

**Reward Calculation:** 
- For every $20 spent, there is a reward of $1.
- Total spent = $80.
- Number of times $20 is spent within $80: \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \).
- Each time $20 is spent, the reward is $1.
- Therefore, the total reward earned is \( 4 \times 1 = \$4 \).

### Step 2: Apply the reward to calculate the effective spending after applying the rewards.
- Effective spending before coupons: \( 80 - 4 = \$76 \).

### Step 3: Determine how much was actually spent due to coupons.
- The customer uses their rewards and applies a coupon that takes off twice the amount of rewards as a discount.
- Rewards applied (twice): \( 2 \times 4 = \$8 \).

### Step 4: Subtract the coupon value from the effective spending.
- Effective spending after applying coupons: \( 76 - 8 = \$68 \).

### Final Answer:
The customer paid a total of **$68** on this shopping trip.<|im_end|>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.

To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs after accounting for taxes.

**Step 1: Calculate the net pay for Job A**

- **Job A details:**
  - Annual salary = $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000 per year.
  - State tax rate = 20%.

- **Net pay calculation:**
  \[
  \text{Net Pay} = \text{Annual Salary} \times (1 - \text{State Tax Rate})
  \]
  \[
  \text{Net Pay}_A = \$30,000 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$30,000 \times 0.80 = \$24,000
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the net pay for Job B**

- **Job B details:**
  - Annual salary = $42,000.
  - Property tax = $6,000.
  - State tax rate = 10%.

- **Net pay calculation:**
  First, subtract the property tax from the annual salary before calculating the net pay:
  \[
  \text{Salary Before Tax} = \$42,000 - \$6,000 = \$36,000
  \]
  
  Then, apply the state tax rate:
  \[
  \text{Net Pay}_B = \$36,000 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$36,000 \times 0.90 = \$32,400
  \]

**Step 3: Compare the net pay amounts**

- Net pay for Job A = $24,000
- Net pay for Job B = $32,400

**Step 4: Determine the difference in net pay**

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Net Pay}_B - \text{Net Pay}_A
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = \$32,400 - \$24,000 = \$8,400
\]

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final answer is:

{The final answer is: $8,400}.<|im_end|>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000

Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000

                    question:
                    : There are 220 castles in Scotland.  ; 40 . percent of . them ? are ruins, and half . of the ruined castles are : unmanned.  How many unmanned ; ruined castles , are there in Scotland?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many castles are ruins.
2. Calculate how many of those ruins are unmanned.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of ruins
We know that 40% of the castles are ruins. Given there are 220 castles total, we can calculate the number of ruins as follows:

\[ \text{Number of ruins} = 0.40 \times 220 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]

So, there are 88 ruins.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruins
We're told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore, we need to find out what half of 88 is:

\[ \text{Unmaned ruins} = \frac{88}{2} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{88}{2} = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruins.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for both options and then compare them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost using Furniture United's offer**
- The initial amount (advance) is $1,350.
- There are 6 monthly payments of $350 each.

Total cost = Advance + (Monthly Payment * Number of Payments)
= $1,350 + ($350 * 6)
= $1,350 + $2,100
= $3,450

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost using Cozy Homes' offer**
- The initial amount (advance) is $1,100.
- There are 9 monthly payments of $250 each.

Total cost = Advance + (Monthly Payment * Number of Payments)
= $1,100 + ($250 * 9)
= $1,100 + $2,250
= $3,350

**Step 3: Determine the cost difference**

Cost difference = Total cost from Furniture United - Total cost from Cozy Homes
= $3,450 - $3,350
= $100

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} $100.<|im_end|>","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450

To determine how much sugar Mason needs for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for one batch of suckers.
- Given: Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar per batch of suckers.

\[
\text{Sugar per batch (suckers)} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
- Multiply the amount of sugar per batch by 8.

\[
\text{Total sugar for 8 batches (suckers)} = 30 \times 8
\]

\[

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Investment**:
   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Total cost = \( 8 \times \$8 = \$64 \).

2. **First Year Increase**:
   - The stock price increases by 50%.
   - New price per share = \( \$8 + (0.5 \times \$8) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \).
   - Value of one share after increase = \$12.

3. **Second Year Decrease**:
   - The stock price decreases by 25%.
   - New price per share = \( \$12 - (0.25 \times \$12) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \).
   - Value of one share after decrease = \$9.

4. **Calculate Final Value**:
   - Maria still owns 8 shares.
   - Total value after both years = \( 8 \times \$9 = \$72 \).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's denote the three groups as follows:
- Group A: \( x \)
- Group B: \( y \)
- Group C: \( z \)

We know the total number of students is 200:
\[ x + y + z = 200 \]

We also have two conditions given:
1. Two groups are equal in number.
2. The third group is 10 less than each of the others.

Let's break down these conditions:

### Step 1: Define Equal Groups
Since two groups are equal, we can set \( y = x \).

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
Now substitute \( y = x \) into the total number equation:
\[ x + x + z = 200 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x + z = 200 \]

### Step 3: Determine the Third Group Size
Given that the third group is 10 less than each of the first two groups:
\[ z = x - 10 \]

### Step 4: Substitute Back into Equation
Substitute \( z = x - 10 \) back into the equation from Step 2:
\[ 2x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + x - 10 = 200 \]
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]
\[ 3x = 210 \]
\[ x = 70 \]

### Step 6: Find \( y \) and \( z \)
Since \( y = x \), then \( y = 70 \).

Using \( z = x - 10 \):
\[ z = 70 - 10 \]
\[ z = 60 \]

### Conclusion
Thus, the sizes of the groups are:
- Group A: 70 students
- Group B: 70 students
- Group C: 60 students

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( K \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that the total number of animals is 60. Therefore,
     \[
     C + K = 60
     \]
   - We also know that there are twice as many chickens as cows, so
     \[
     C = 2K
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve for One Variable:**
   - Substitute \( C = 2K \) into the first equation:
     \[
     2K + K = 60
     \]
     Simplify to find \( K \):
     \[
     3K = 60
     \]
     Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     K = 20
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Since \( C = 2K \), substitute \( K = 20 \):
     \[
     C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   - Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of chicken legs is:
     \[
     40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs/chicken} = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]
   - Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of cow legs is:
     \[
     20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs/cow} = 80 \text{ legs}
     \]

6. **Add Both Totals Together:**
   - Add the number of chicken legs and cow legs:
     \[
     80 \text{ (chicken legs)} + 80 \text{ (cow legs)} = 160 \text{ legs}
     \]

**Final Answer:** The total number of animal legs is 160.<|im_end|>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.

   - Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his routine.

2. **Weekly Progression**:

3. **Drop During Performance**:
   - When Josh performs at the talent show after 4 weeks (after the fourth week), he accidentally drops 3 of his balls.

4. **Calculation**:

   - Balls left for the audience = 6 balls (initial number) - 3 balls (dropped) = 3 balls remaining

5. **Audience Reaction**:
   - The crowd catches 2 of these balls during the performance.
   - This leaves 1 ball uncaught.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since there was only 1 ball left uncaught among the 3 that were initially dropped, Josh now has 1 ball remaining.

Therefore, the correct answer should be: **Josh starts to juggle 1 ball on stage with 1 ball left uncaught**.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the weights of different animals based on their descriptions. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( P \) be the weight of the pink frog.
- \( B \) be the weight of the blue beetle.
- \( G \) be the weight of the green toad.
- \( Y \) be the weight of the yellow snake.
- \( R \) be the weight of the red bird.

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ P = 50 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Establish Relationships Based on Descriptions
According to the problem, there are several relationships between these animals:
1. The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[ P = B \]
   Substituting \( P = 50 \):
   \[ 50 = B \]
   So,
   \[ B = 50 \text{ pounds} \]

2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[ B = G \]
   Since \( B = 50 \), then:
   \[ G = 50 \text{ pounds} \]

3. The green toad weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[ G = Y - 10 \]
   Substituting \( G = 50 \):
   \[ 50 = Y - 10 \]
   Solving for \( Y \):
   \[ Y = 60 \text{ pounds} \]

4. The yellow snake weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:
   \[ Y = R + 20 \]
   Substituting \( Y = 60 \):
   \[ 60 = R + 20 \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[ R = 40 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Weight in the Container
Now, let’s find out how much the total weight would be when one of each animal (pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird) is placed in the container.

First, add up all individual animal weights:
\[
P + B + G + Y + R = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 40
\]

Summing these values:
\[
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 40 = 270 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, add the weight of the container itself:
\[
270 \text{ pounds} + 20 \text{ pounds} = 290 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is **290 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many outfits Laurel received at her friend's house.
- Laurel received 24 baby outfits from her friend.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of outfits Laurel has after receiving them.
- After receiving 24 outfits, we need to add any gifts she might receive in future events.

### Step 3: Consider the gift from her friend's house again (the second time).
- According to the information, Laurel received an additional set of outfits from her friend.
- This means she received 24 more outfits from her friend.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of outfits Laurel now has.
- Total outfits = 24 (from first gift) + 24 (second gift)
- Total outfits = 24 + 24 = 48 outfits.

### Step 5: Account for the gift from her mother's house.
- Her mother gifted her 15 more baby outfits.

### Step 6: Calculate the final total number of outfits Laurel has.
- Final total outfits = 48 (current total) + 15 (gift from mother)
- Final total outfits = 48 + 15 = 63 outfits.

### Conclusion:
Laurel currently has 63 baby outfits for her baby.

                    question:
                    , In his , training as ? a professional ; athlete, ! Tyson runs 5000 meters every . day. ; His coach, however, wants him to run 1/5 times more , meters in a ! day. If he . took the coach's advice and . trained : for a month, what is . the total distance he ? covered in June?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the increase in running distance per session.
Tyson runs 5000 meters per session. The coach suggests that Tyson should run \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more than usual.

\[
\text{Increase} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the new daily running distance.
Since the coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more than usual, we add the increase to the original distance:

\[
\text{New Distance per Session} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of sessions per day.
A typical day consists of 8 hours of practice (assuming a standard workday).

\[
\text{Number of Sessions per Day} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{\text{Time per Session}}
\]

However, since the time per session isn't specified, we'll assume an average of 4 sessions per day (a common practice in many sports).

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of days in June.
June has 30 days.

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance Tyson covers in one session.
Now that we know the new distance per session, we can calculate how much Tyson runs in one session over the course of a month.

\[
\text{Total Distance per Month} = \text{Session Distance} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]
\[
\text{Total Distance per Month} = 6000 \text{ meters/session} \times 30 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 6: Perform the multiplication.
\[
\text{Total Distance per Month} = 6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Conclusion:
Tyson would cover a total distance of 180,000 meters if he trains according to the coach’s advice for a month. 

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180,000 \text{ meters}}
\]<|im_end|>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the price of Juice Box B:**
   - We know that Juice Box A costs $4.
   - Juice Box B is $.5 more expensive than Juice Box A.
   
   So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box B} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 0.5 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the price of Juice Box C:**
   - Juice Box C is $7 more expensive than Juice Box B.
   
   So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box C} = \text{Price of Juice Box B} + 7 = 4.5 + 7 = 11.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much more Juice Box C is compared to Juice Box B:**
   - Price of Juice Box C = $11.5
   - Price of Juice Box B = $4.5
   
   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Difference in prices} = \text{Price of Juice Box C} - \text{Price of Juice Box B} = 11.5 - 4.5 = 7 \text{ dollars}

                    question:
                    A restaurant has 40 tables . with ; 4 legs and 50 . tables with 3 legs. Calculate the : total , number . of legs the restaurant's tables ! have.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for all the tables in the restaurant. We know that some tables have 4 legs each, while others have 3 legs each.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of tables:**
   - There are 40 tables in total.

2. **Identify how many tables have 4 legs:**
   - Since there are 40 tables and 50 tables have 3 legs (the rest have 4 legs), we can find out how many tables have 4 legs by subtracting the number of tables with 3 legs from the total number of tables.
     \[
     \text{Number of tables with 4 legs} = 40 - 50 = -10
     \]
     This calculation shows an inconsistency because it results in a negative number. It seems there might be a mistake or missing information about the distribution of table types. However, assuming the numbers provided are correct and no additional tables were mentioned, let's proceed with the given data.

3. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of tables with 4 legs.
   - The remaining \( y \) tables will then have 3 legs.
   
   Given that \( x + y = 40 \).

   If we assume there was a mix-up in the count of tables having 3 legs, but still follow the initial setup, we would use:
   
   For the tables with 4 legs:
   \[
   \text{Total legs from 4-legged tables} = 4x
   \]

   For the tables with 3 legs:
   \[
   \text{Total legs from 3-legged tables} = 3y
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 4x + 3y
   \]

Since the exact distribution isn't clear without more information, I'll provide a general approach based on the assumption that the number of tables with 3 legs could vary if there was any miscounting. 

### Final Answer Calculation:

Given the mixed up logic above, let's simplify directly using the assumed numbers:

Assume initially correctly stated, we have:
\[
4x + 3(40-x) = 4x + 120 - 3x = x + 120
\]

If \( x = 20 \):
\[
\text{Total legs} = 20 + 120 = 140
\]

Therefore, the total number of legs in the restaurant's tables is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]<|im_end|>","The total number of legs which the tables with four legs have is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 legs

   - Jenny buys 1 bag containing 36 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies go into the son's lunch box:**
   - She puts 4 cookies into the son's lunch box every day.
   - There are 5 days in a week (as given).
   
3. **Calculate the total number of cookies put into the lunch box:**
   \[
   \text{Cookies per day} \times \text{Days} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total original price without any discount:**
   - Each shirt costs $30.
   - Davos bought 2 shirts.
   - Therefore, the total original price = \( 2 \times 30 = \$60 \).

2. **Apply the discount to find out what Davos actually paid:**
   - The discount rate is 40%.
   - To calculate the discount amount, we need to find 40% of the total original price.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Discount Amount} = \frac{40}{100} \times 60 = 0.4 \times 60 = \$24
     \]
   
3. **Subtract the discount amount from the total original price to get the final amount paid:**
   - Total amount paid = Original price - Discount Amount
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Amount Paid} = 60 - 24 = \$36
     \]

Therefore, Davos paid $\boxed{36}$ for the 2 shirts after applying the 40% discount.<|im_end|>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.

                    , A factory used to make tractors, but now makes ; silos. : When they made tractors, , they sold 10 tractors a day . and : made $100 per tractor. Now, . they sell ? 5 ! silos a ! day, and ? make $220 per silo. What , percentage more : are they making per day now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine the increase in profit per day when the factory starts selling silos instead of tractors.

### Step 1: Calculate daily revenue from tractors before switching to silos.
- They sold 10 tractors per day at $100 per tractor.
\[ \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \times \$100 = \$1000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate total cost for manufacturing one tractor.
Let's assume that it costs \( C \) dollars to manufacture one tractor.

### Step 3: Calculate total cost for manufacturing five tractors.
\[ \text{Total Cost for Tractors} = 5 \times C \]

### Step 4: Calculate total revenue from silos after switching to silos.
- They sell 5 silos per day at $220 per silo.
\[ \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \times \$220 = \$1100 \]

### Step 5: Calculate total cost for manufacturing five silos.
Assuming that it costs \( C \) dollars to manufacture one silo (since the cost per silo is not specified, we will use the same \( C \) as for tractors).

### Step 6: Calculate total cost for manufacturing five silos.
\[ \text{Total Cost for Silos} = 5 \times C \]

### Step 7: Determine the change in revenue due to switching from tractors to silos.
\[ \Delta \text{Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} - \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} \]
\[ \Delta \text{Revenue} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100 \]

### Step 8: Determine the change in cost due to switching from tractors to silos.
Since the total cost remains the same regardless of what they produce, the change in cost is zero.

### Step 9: Calculate the new profit margin per day based on the change in revenue.
\[ \text{New Profit Margin per Day} = \frac{\Delta \text{Revenue}}{\text{Total Cost}} \]
Since the total cost remains the same, the new profit margin per day is solely dependent on the change in revenue.
\[ \text{New Profit Margin per Day} = \frac{\$100}{\text{Total Cost}} \]

### Step 10: Express the new profit margin as a percentage of the original profit margin.
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Profit Margin per Day}}{\text{Original Profit Margin per Day}} \right) \times 100 \]
Where the original profit margin per day was calculated using the initial number of tractors.

### Final Answer:
To find the exact percentage increase, we would need the specific value of \( C \). However, if we denote the original profit margin per day as \( P_{\text{original}} \), then:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{P_{\text{original}}} \right) \times 100 \]

- **Treats**:
  - Cost per month = $20  

- **Medicine**:
  - Cost per month = $100  

Total monthly expense = Food + Treats + Medicine

                    question:
                    April is donating ! plant pots ? to a local ? school for . their new garden. They . ask for 30 . plant pots . for the daisies, and twice ; as ! many for the roses.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of plant pots needed:**
   - For the daisies: 30 pots.
   - For the roses: Twice as many as the daisies, which means \(2 \times 30 = 60\) pots.
   
   Therefore, the total number of pots needed is \(30 + 60 = 90\).

2. **Determine how many plant pots April has initially:**
   - April had 100 plant pots from the garden center before she knew how many she needed.

3. **Calculate how many plant pots April has left after purchasing the necessary amount:**
   - Subtract the number of pots needed (90) from the initial number of pots (100).
   
   So, \(100 - 90 = 10\).

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.
This means she is giving the school 60 plant pots for roses + 30 plant pots for daisies = <<60+30=90>>90 plant pots.
So in total, Alice has 100 – 90 = <<100-90=10>>10 plant pots left over.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent.
- Andrea spent $11 on an sweater.
- She also gave $4 to her brother.

Total spent = $11 (sweater) + $4 (given to brother)
Total spent = $15

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount saved.
- We know that after spending $15, she has $36 left.
- Therefore, the total amount before spending was the sum of what she saved and what she spent.

Let \( S \) represent the amount saved.
\[ S + 15 = 36 \]

### Step 3: Solve for the saved amount.
Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[ S + 15 = 36 \]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[ S = 36 - 15 \]
\[ S = 21 \]

Therefore, the amount saved by Andrea is **$21**.<|im_end|>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down John's activities step by step:

1. **Boating and Swimming Time**:
   - John spends 6 hours on boating.
   - He spends half as much time swimming: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Total Time Spent on Boating and Swimming**:
   - Combined, these two activities take up:
     \[
     6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Time Spent Watching Shows**:
   - He watches 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours.
   - Total time watching shows:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Total Time Spent on Activities**:
   - Adding up all the times:
     \[
     9 \text{ (boating and swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Time Spent Sightseeing**:
   - We know that 30% of the total time was spent on sightseeing.
   - Let \( T \) be the total time spent on all activities.
   - According to the problem, 30% of \( T \) equals the time spent on sightseeing.

So,
\[
0.3T = \text{time spent on sightseeing}
\]
Since we have already calculated that 15 hours is the total time spent on other activities, it follows that:
\[
T = 15 \text{ hours}
\]
Therefore, the time spent sightseeing can now be found by:
\[
\text{time spent on sightseeing} = 0.3 \times 15 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, John spent 4.5 hours sightseeing. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4.5 \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming
He spent 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Annabelle's total earnings from both jobs.**

- **First job**: 
  - Earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
  - Hourly wage = $10/hour
  - Hours worked = 20 hours
  - Total earnings from first job = $10/hour * 20 hours = $200

- **Second job**: 
  - Earnings = Hourly wage * Hours worked
  - Hourly wage = $5/hour
  - Hours worked = 15 hours
  - Total earnings from second job = $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

- **Total earnings from both jobs**:
  - Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job
  - Total earnings = $200 (from first job) + $75 (from second job)
  - Total earnings = $275

**Step 2: Subtract Annabelle's current savings from the cost of the phone to determine how much more she needs to save.**

- Cost of the phone = $400
- Current savings = $80
- Money needed to save = Cost of the phone - Current savings
- Money needed to save = $400 - $80 = $320

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save **$320**.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: $320.<|im_end|>","Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.
From her first job, she earns $10 * 20 hours = $<<10*20=200>>200.
From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

2. **Calculate the height of the second tree:**
   - Height of the second tree = 6 + 5 = 11 feet.

3. **Determine the combined height of the shortest and second trees:**
   - Combined height = 6 (shortest) + 11 (second) = 17 feet.

4. **Find the height of the tallest tree:**
   - Tallest tree = Twice the combined height of the shortest and second trees.
   - Height of the tallest tree = 2 × 17 = 34 feet.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Morgan has left after accounting for her budget for the birthday party and then figure out how many friends she can invite based on their costs.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine total budget
Morgan's dad told her that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party.

### Step 2: Calculate expenses from the budget
- **Mini-Golf**: $5 per round
- **Arcade Tokens**: $5
- **Go-Karts**: $10 per ride (twice)

First, calculate the cost for one round of mini-golf:
\[ \text{Cost for one round} = \$5 \]

Next, calculate the cost for two rides on the go-karts:
\[ \text{Cost for two go-kart rides} = \$10 \times 2 = \$20 \]

Now, add up all these costs:
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$5 + \$5 + \$20 = \$30 \]

### Step 3: Subtract expenses from the budget
Subtract the total expenses from the initial budget:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = \$90 - \$30 = \$60 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of friends Morgan can invite
Each friend will contribute towards both the mini-golf and go-kart expenses.
- Each friend contributes $5 towards mini-golf.
- Each friend also contributes $5 towards go-karts.

So, each friend contributes:
\[ \$5 (\text{mini-golf}) + \$5 (\text{go-karts}) = \$10 \]

Finally, divide the remaining budget by the contribution per friend:
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$60}{\$10 \text{ per friend}} = 6 \]

### Final Answer:
Morgan can invite **6 friends**.<|im_end|>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Marisa receives daily.
Marisa receives $5 every day.

### Step 2: Calculate how many lollipops she can buy with that amount of money.
Each lollipop costs 25 cents. To find out how many lollipops she can buy with $5, we divide $5 by the cost per lollipop (which is $0.25).

\[ \text{Number of lollipops} = \frac{\$5}{\$0.25} \]

### Step 3: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Number of lollipops} = \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \]

So far, Marisa has bought 20 lollipops and saved any remaining money after buying them.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the lollipops.
Since each lollipop costs $0.25 and she bought 20 lollipops:

\[ \text{Total cost of lollipops} = 20 \times \$0.25 \]

### Step 5: Perform the multiplication.
\[ \text{Total cost of lollipops} = 20 \times 0.25 = \$5 \]

This means she spent all her daily allowance on lollipops.

### Step 6: Determine how much money she has left after buying the lollipops.
She received $5 initially, so subtracting the cost of the lollipops leaves her with no money left.

### Conclusion:
After spending all her money on lollipops, Marisa has nothing left in her piggy bank. Therefore, the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank is $0.

\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much candy Billy bought given that he spent all his money and bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.

1. **Determine the total amount spent:**
   Billy buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each.
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 40 \times 0.05 = \$2.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining amount after spending on gumballs:**
   Billy started with $10 from his dad.
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 10 - 2 = \$8
   \]
   
3. **Determine the price per pound of candy:**
   The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   
4. **Calculate the number of pounds of candy purchased:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy bought.
   \[
   \text{Cost of candy} = 1.5x
   \]
   Since Billy has exactly $8 left after buying the candy,
   \[
   1.5x = 8
   \]
   Solving for \( x \),
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{1.5} = \frac{8}{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{8 \times 2}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Carver turns 45 years old.
   
2. **Calculate how many years older Carver is than his son**:
   - According to the information given, Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his son.

3. **Express this relationship mathematically**:
   Let \( S \) be the son's current age.
   - Twice the son's age = \( 2S \).
   - Carver is 5 years younger than that: \( 2S - 5 \).

4. **Set up an equation based on their ages**:
   - Since Carver is currently 45 years old, we can write: 
     \[
     2S - 5 = 45

   S = \frac{50}{2} \\
   S = 25
   \]
   Therefore, Carver's son is currently 25 years old.

6. **Determine how many more years until the son reaches 45 years old**:
   - The son will reach 45 after 9 more years (since he is already 25 years old now).

7. **Verify if the solution satisfies all conditions**:
   - If Carver is 45 and his son is 25, then twice the son's age is indeed \( 2 \times 25 = 50 \), and Carver is 5 years younger than that, which confirms our calculations.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{25}\).<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.

Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the journey into segments and calculate the total distance traveled in one round trip.

### Step 1: Calculate the distances for one round trip
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles.
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles.
- From the third city back to the first city (since it only travels from the third city to the first):
    - This segment is 50 miles less than the sum of the two previous segments.
    
    Sum of the first two segments = 75 + 100 = 175 miles.
    Therefore, the third segment = 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for one round trip
Total distance = 75 + 100 + 125 = 200 miles.

### Step 3: Determine the number of round trips per day
It takes place 3 times a day, so the number of round trips per day is 3.

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance covered in one day
Total distance covered in one day = 200 miles/day * 3 = 600 miles/day.

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance covered in three days
Total distance covered in three days = 600 miles/day * 3 = 1800 miles.

### Step 6: Determine how many days it takes to reach 18,000 miles
Number of days = Total distance / Distance per day = 18,000 miles / 1800 miles/day ≈ 10 days.

Therefore, the train goes between services after approximately **10 days**.<|im_end|>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip
The third leg is 175-50=<<175-50=125>>125 miles
So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of stuffing needed for one collie bed:**
   - The average amount of stuffing per bed between the Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average stuffing} = \frac{\text{Stuffing for Rottweiler}}{\text{Stuffing for Chihuahua}} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, a collie bed requires 4 pounds of stuffing.

2. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total stuffing required is:
     \[
     \text{Total stuffing (chihuahuas)} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:**
   - As determined earlier, each collie bed requires 4 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total stuffing required is:
     \[
     \text{Total stuffing (collies)} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total stuffing needed for all the beds:**
   - Add the stuffing for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds together:
     \[
     \text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 + 12 = 20 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Mark needs 20 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{20}
\]<|im_end|>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on both trips. Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the first trip (to John's friend's house)
- Distance to the friend's house = 200 miles
- Speed on the way there = 70 mph

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{there}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{there}} = \frac{200}{70} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{there}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the detour back home
- The detour adds an extra 10 miles to the distance.

\[ \text{Total distance for the detour} = 200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles} \]

- Speed on the way back = 80 mph

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{210}{80} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back}} = \frac{21}{8} \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time for the trip
- Total time = Time to friend's house + Time back home

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} + \frac{21}{8} \text{ hours} \]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator:

\[ \text{Common denominator} = 56 \]

Convert each fraction:

\[ \frac{20}{7} = \frac{20 \times 8}{7 \times 8} = \frac{160}{56} \]

\[ \frac{21}{8} = \frac{21 \times 7}{8 \times 7} = \frac{147}{56} \]

Now add them together:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{160}{56} + \frac{147}{56} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{160 + 147}{56} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{307}{56} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total trip took **3.6** hours.<|im_end|>","The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of fourth-graders in the school:**
   - We know there are 96 fourth-graders.

2. **Calculate the number of girls in the school:**
   - Given that 43 of these students are girls.
   
3. **Calculate the number of boys in the school:**
   - Since we know the total number of students (96) and the number of girls (43), we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students.
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
     \]

4. **Account for the missing boys on Friday:**
   - On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.
   
5. **Calculate the number of boys present on Friday:**
   - To find out how many boys were present on Friday, we need to determine the initial number of boys before any were absent.
   - The total number of students on Friday should still be 96 because the absence of both girls and boys does not affect the total count.
   - Therefore, the number of boys present on Friday must be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present on Friday} = \text{Initial number of boys} - (\text{Number of boys absent} + \text{Number of girls absent})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present on Friday} = 53 - (5 + 4)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present on Friday} = 53 - 9 = 44

   - Let \( B \) represent the number of boys.
   - According to the problem, the number of boys is twice the number of girls.

3. **Set up an equation based on the relationship between the number of boys and girls:**
   - Since the number of boys is twice the number of girls, we can write: 
     \[
     B = 2 \times (\text{number of girls})

First, let's calculate the total points from the first two tests.

- First test: Jane scored 15 points.
- Second test: Jane scored 18 points.

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

### Step 2: Determine the required total for promotion
According to the given information, the combined scores of all three tests must equal at least 42 points.

Let \( x \) represent the score on the third test. The equation representing this condition is:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - Four times the number of customers who refused to wear masks equals the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.
   - The difference between these two numbers (four times the number of mask refusers) minus five equals the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.
   
   Therefore, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   4x = y + 5
   \]
   where \( y \) represents the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   From the above equation, we know:
   \[
   x = \frac{y}{4}
   \]

4. **Find the value of \( y \):**
   We also know that the total number of people kicked out was 50, so:
   \[
   x + y = 50
   \]
   Substitute \( x \) from the previous equation into this equation:
   \[
   \frac{y}{4} + y = 50
   \]
   Simplify and solve for \( y \):
   \[
   \frac{y}{4} + y = 50 \\
   \frac{y}{4} + \frac{4y}{4} = 50 \\
   \frac{5y}{4} = 50 \\
   5y = 200 \\
   y = 40
   \]

5. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks:**
   Since \( x = \frac{y}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence:**
   According to the problem statement, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence:
   \[
   3y = 3 \times 40 = 120
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   Check if the sum of all these groups equals the total number of people kicked out:
   \[
   10 (\text{mask refusers}) + 40 (\text{shoplifters}) + 120 (\text{physical violence}) = 50

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons (other than refusing to wear masks or shoplifting) is **120**.<|im_end|>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many points Sara has after Erin scores.
Erin scores 14 points, and Sara has three times as many points as Erin.

- Points Sara has = 3 × Points Erin has
- Let \( E \) be the number of points Erin has initially (which we need to find).
- So, \( S = 3E \)

We know that Erin scores 14 points in total. This means that Sara’s score must account for the remaining points after Erin’s score.

### Step 2: Set up an equation based on the information given.
Since Erin scores all her points first, Sara must have scored the rest of those points.

- Total points scored by both Erin and Sara = 14 + Remaining points scored by Sara
- The remaining points scored by Sara can be represented as \( R \).

Given that Sara has three times as many points as Erin, we can write:
\[ S = 3E \]

But since the total points scored by both are equal to 14, we also have:
\[ E + R = 14 \]
Where \( R \) represents the points scored by Sara.

### Step 3: Solve for the initial number of points Erin had.
From the above equations, we substitute \( S = 3E \) into the total points equation:
\[ E + R = 14 \]

And from \( S = 3E \), we know that Sara's points are three times Erin's points:
\[ 3E + R = 14 \]

Now, we can set these two expressions equal to each other because they represent the same quantity:
\[ 3E + R = 14 \]

Subtracting \( 3E \) from both sides gives us:
\[ R = 14 - 3E \]

Since \( R \) is the points scored by Sara, and she scored three times as many points as Erin, we know that:
\[ S = 3E \]

Thus, the points scored by Sara must be equal to three times the points scored by Erin:
\[ S = 3E \]

Finally, substituting \( S = 3E \) back into the total points equation:
\[ 3E + R = 14 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3E + R = 14 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 14 - 3E \]

So, the remaining points scored by Sara is:
\[ R = 14 - 3E \]

Therefore, Erin originally had 14 points minus whatever points she scored later, which is:
\[ E = 14 - R \]

### Conclusion:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]<|im_end|>","Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.

                    question:
                    44 seniors need to receive , awards.  Each senior receives a picture frame . that , costs $20. .  . Each picture frame needs to be etched ! with the logo for an additional ; 20% cost , per frame.  2 , of the seniors : will also ; receive pins that : are $5.  , 1/4 ! of the seniors , are officers and ! they will . need : to receive : cords ; that are $12 each.  How , much will be spent . on the senior gifts?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the total amount spent on the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of seniors who receive each type of gift.
- **Picture frames** (costing $20 each):
  \[
  \text{Number of seniors} = 44
  \]
  \[
  \text{Cost per frame} = \$20
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost for picture frames} = 44 \times 20 = \$880
  \]

- **Pins** (each costing $5):
  \[
  \text{Number of seniors} = 2
  \]
  \[
  \text{Cost per pin} = \$5
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost for pins} = 2 \times 5 = \$10
  \]

- **Cords** (each costing $12):
  \[
  \text{Number of seniors} = \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11
  \]
  \[
  \text{Cost per cord} = \$12
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost for cords} = 11 \times 12 = \$132
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up all the individual costs.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$880 + \$10 + \$132 = \$1022
\]

Therefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is:

\[
\boxed{\$1022}
\]<|im_end|>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.
Total cost for the senior's picture frames is 44 seniors * $24 = $<<44*24=1056>>1056.
The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.
The total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the savings from the DIY option:**
   - The original price of hand-painted wallpaper is $400.
   - The DIY option saves 20% on the materials.

2. **Determine the amount saved:**
   - Savings = Original Price × (Savings Percentage / 100)
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \$400 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) = \$80
     \]

3. **Subtract the savings from the original price to find the total cost for the DIY option:**
   - Total Cost = Original Price - Savings
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \$400 - \$80 = \$320
     \]

So, the total cost for making the hand-painted wallpaper yourself would be $320. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\boxed{320}<|im_end|>","A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.

<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of shoes sold on Saturday.
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

**Calculation for Saturday:**  
\[ \text{Saturday sales} = 2 \times \text{Friday sales} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of shoes sold on Sunday.
- On Saturday, the store sold twice as much as on Friday, which means it sold \( 2 \times 14 = 28 \) pairs of shoes.

**Calculation for Sunday:**  
\[ \text{Sunday sales} = 28 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of shoes sold on Monday.
- On Monday, the store sold half the amount sold on Saturday, which means it sold \( \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \) pairs of shoes.

**Calculation for Monday:**  
\[ \text{Monday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Saturday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of shoes sold over the three days.
- Total sales (sum of all days):  
\[ \text{Total sales} = \text{Friday sales} + \text{Saturday sales} + \text{Sunday sales} + \text{Monday sales} \]
\[ \text{Total sales} = 14 + 28 + 28 + 14 = 94 \]

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate accordingly.

### Step 1: Calculate dance practice time on Tuesdays
- Dance practice duration on Tuesdays = 1 hour per day.
- Number of days in a week where dance practice occurs (excluding Saturdays) = 5 (Tuesdays + Thursdays).
- Total dance practice time on Tuesdays = 1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate dance practice time on Thursdays
- Dance practice duration on Thursdays = 2 hours per day.
- Number of days in a week where dance practice occurs (excluding Saturdays) = 5 (Tuesdays + Thursdays).
- Total dance practice time on Thursdays = 2 hours/day * 5 days = 10 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate total dance practice time on Saturdays
- Dance practice duration on Saturdays = Twice the duration of Tuesday’s practice.
- Duration of Tuesday’s practice = 1 hour.
- Duration of Saturday’s practice = 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.

### Step 4: Calculate total dance practice time on all days (including Saturdays)
- Total dance practice time on Tuesdays = 5 hours.
- Total dance practice time on Thursdays = 10 hours.
- Total dance practice time on Saturdays = 2 hours.

### Step 5: Sum up the total dance practice time for the entire week
- Total dance practice time for the week = (Total on Tuesdays) + (Total on Thursdays) + (Total on Saturdays)
- Total dance practice time for the week = 5 hours + 10 hours + 2 hours = 17 hours.

### Final Answer
She had dance practice for **17 hours** a week.<|im_end|>","She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the value of faulty equipment:**
   - The company bought equipment for $400,000.
   - The value of faulty equipment is 40% of the total value.
   - Faulty equipment = 40/100 * $400,000 = $160,000.

2. **Calculate the value of non-faulty equipment:**
   - Non-faulty equipment = Total value - Value of faulty equipment.
   - Non-faulty equipment = $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

3. **Calculate the total cost if no returns were made:**
   - This would be the sum of all purchased equipment (faulty + non-faulty).
   - Total cost without returns = $400,000.

4. **Determine how much was refunded due to returns:**
   - Since the company returned all faulty equipment, the full value of the faulty equipment ($160,000) will be refunded.

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after refunds:**
   - Amount left after refunds = Total cost without returns - Refunded amount.
   - Amount left after refunds = $400,000 - $160,000 = $240,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $\boxed{240000}$.<|im_end|>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

   - She divides them into two equal groups.
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in each group} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of milk collected from each group daily:**
   - From the first half (15 sheep), she collects 1 kg of milk per day.
   - From the second half (another 15 sheep), she collects 2 kg of milk per day.

3. **Sum up the total amount of milk collected per day:**
   - Milk from the first half:
     \[
     15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
     \]
   - Milk from the second half:
     \[
     15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Add the amounts together to get the total daily milk collection:**
   \[
   15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many pupils like blue:**
   - We know that half of the class likes blue.
   - The total number of pupils is 40.
   - Therefore, the number of pupils who like blue = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \).

2. **Calculate the number of pupils left after those who like blue have been accounted for:**
   - Since half of the class (20) already like blue, there are \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) pupils left.

3. **Determine how many of the remaining pupils like green:**
   - One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green.
   - The number of pupils who like green = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \).

4. **Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow:**
   - After accounting for those who like blue and green, the remainder will be those who like yellow.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of apples picked on Monday.
- Lucy gets $56 from selling apples picked on Monday.
- The price per apple is $4.
- Therefore, the number of apples picked on Monday can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

So, Lucy picked **14** apples on Monday.

### Step 2: Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday.
- On Tuesday, Lucy picked **12** apples.

### Step 3: Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday.
- On Wednesday, Lucy picked **double** the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
- Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, on Wednesday she picked:

\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days.
- Total apples picked on Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday:

\[
14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)}
\]

Adding these together gives:

\[
14 + 12 + 24 = 50
\]

Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is **50**.

### Final Answer:
\[

On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of socks Lindsay initially had:**
   - Lindsay has 50 pairs of socks.
   - Each pair consists of 2 socks.
   - Therefore, the total number of socks Lindsay initially had is:
     \[
     50 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 100 \text{ socks}
     \]

2. **Determine how many socks were washed during the wash cycle:**
   - Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
   - Since each pair contains 2 socks, the number of socks in 10 pairs is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks per pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
     \]
   - Additionally, she washes 15 loose socks.

3. **Calculate the total number of socks that have been washed:**
   - The total number of socks washed is the sum of the socks from the paired sets and the loose socks:
     \[
     20 \text{ (from paired sets)} + 15 \text{ (loose socks)} = 35 \text{ socks}
     \]

4. **Subtract the number of socks washed from the initial total to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed:**
   - The number of socks missed is:
     \[
     100 \text{ (initial total)} - 35 \text{ (socks washed)} = 65 \text{ socks}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{65}
\]<|im_end|>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel initially had:**
   - Rachel bought 23 cookies.
   - Janet gave her 42 more cookies.
   - Total cookies = 23 (Rachel's) + 42 (Janet's) = 65 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies were eaten by Rachel's brother:**
   - Her brother ate 44% of the total cookies she had.
   - To find out how many that is, we calculate 44% of 65 cookies.

Let's perform the calculation for the amount eaten by her brother:
\[ \text{Cookies eaten} = 0.44 \times 65 \]
\[ \text{Cookies eaten} = 28.6 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie in this context, we'll round to the nearest whole number if necessary but here we keep it as decimal since the original numbers suggest fractional cookies.

3. **Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies:**
   - Total cookies before eating = 65
   - Cookies eaten = 28.6 (rounding up to 29 since you can't eat partial cookies)
   - Cookies left for Rachel = 65 - 29 = 36 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]<|im_end|>","The number of Rachel's cookies is 23 + 42 = <<23+42=65>>65 cookies.
After her brother’s feast, she was left with 65 – 44 = <<65-44=21>>21 cookies.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Karan borrowed $3,650 : for five months at an : interest rate . of ! 10%. She has to pay an equal ? amount every ? month. How much does ! she have to ? pay per : month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Karan will owe after five months, including the interest on that loan. Then, we'll divide that total by the number of months she pays it back.

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest**
The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

Where:
- \(P\) is the principal (the initial amount borrowed),
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate,
- \(t\) is the time period in years.

Since the interest rate is given as a percentage, we can convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100. For simplicity, let's assume the interest rate is expressed as a percentage without conversion to a decimal.

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $3,650
- Annual Interest Rate (\(r\)) = 10% or 0.10
- Time Period (\(t\)) = 5 months

First, convert the monthly interest into an annual interest:
\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = 10\% = 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Number of Months} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Total Months} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ days} \]

Now, apply the interest calculation:

\[ \text{Interest} = 3,650 \times 0.10 \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 3,650 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 21,900 \]

So, the total interest over 5 months is $21,900.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount to be paid back**
This includes both the principal and the interest:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3,650 + 21,900 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 25,550 \]

**Step 3: Divide the total amount by the number of payments**
Karan needs to make payments equally over 5 months. So, we divide the total amount by 5:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Payments}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{25,550}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 5,110 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay **$5,110 per month**.<|im_end|>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how far farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled based on their respective speeds and times.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Cho hiked.
- Speed of Cho = 14 km/hour
- Time spent hiking by Cho = 8 hours

Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):

\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 14 \, \text{km/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours}
\]

\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 112 \, \text{kilometers}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Chloe hiked.
- Speed of Chloe = 9 km/hour
- Time spent hiking by Chloe = 5 hours

Using the same formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 9 \, \text{km/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours}
\]

\[
\text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 45 \, \text{kilometers}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much farther Cho hiked than Chloe.
Subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

\[
\Delta \text{Distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} - \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe}
\]

\[
\Delta \text{Distance} = 112 \, \text{kilometers} - 45 \, \text{kilometers}
\]

\[
\Delta \text{Distance} = 67 \, \text{kilometers}
\]

Therefore, Cho hiked **67 kilometers** farther than Chloe.<|im_end|>","Cho = 14 * 8 = <<14*8=112>>112 km

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much money Axel has:**
   - Axel has \(50\) silver pesos.
   - Axel also has \(80\) gold pesos.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Axel has:**
   \[
   \text{Total money for Axel} = 50 \times \text{silver pesos per peso} + 80 \times \text{gold pesos per peso}
   \]
   Since there are no specific values provided for the conversion between silver and gold pesos, let’s assume that each silver peso is worth one unit of currency and each gold peso is worth two units (common in some countries).

3. **Calculate the value of each type of currency based on their given quantities:**

   - Silver pesos: 
     \[
     50 \times 1 = 50 \text{ units}
     \]

   - Gold pesos:
     \[
     80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ units}
     \]

4. **Add up all the values to get the total amount of money Axel has:**
   \[
   \text{Total money for Axel} = 50 \text{ units (silver)} + 160 \text{ units (gold)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money for Axel} = 210 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Anna has:**
   - Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel.
   - Anna has \(40\) more gold pesos than Axel.

6. **Calculate the total amount of money Anna has:**
   - Let's denote the number of silver pesos Axel has as \(S\).
   - Then, Anna has \(2S\) silver pesos.
   - The total number of silver pesos Anna has is \(S + 2S = 3S\), where \(S = 50\).

7. **Calculate the total number of gold pesos Anna has:**
   - Anna has \(40\) more gold pesos than Axel.
   - The total number of gold pesos Anna has is \(80 + 40 = 120\).

8. **Convert both amounts into the same unit for easy addition:**
   - Convert silver pesos to units: 
     \[
     50 \text{ silver pesos} \rightarrow 50 \times 1 = 50 \text{ units}
     \]
   - Convert gold pesos to units:
     \[
     120 \text{ gold pesos} \rightarrow 120 \times 2 = 240 \text{ units}
     \]

9. **Sum up the total amount of money for Anna:**
   \[
   \text{Total money for Anna} = 50 \text{ units (silver)} + 240 \text{ units (gold)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money for Anna} = 290 \text{ units}
   \]

10. **Add the total amounts of money for Axel and Anna together:**
    \[
    \text{Total money together} = 210 \text{ units (Axel)} + 290 \text{ units (Anna)}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Total money together} = 500 \text{ units}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade made**

Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.

\[ \text{Total cups} = 3 \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Total cups} = 36 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the cups**

Each cup is sold for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups at $1 each:

\[ \text{Revenue} = 36 \times 1 \]

\[ \text{Revenue} = \$36 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of supplies**

She spent $18 on supplies to make the lemonade.

\[ \text{Cost} = \$18 \]

**Step 4: Compute the profit**

Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 36 - 18 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$18 \]

**Step 5: Determine the time spent running the lemonade stand**

The lemonade stand is open for 2 hours (since she sells 4 cups per hour).

\[ \text{Time} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the hourly profit**

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, divide the total profit by the time spent:

\[ \text{Hourly Profit} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Time}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly Profit} = \frac{18}{2} \]

\[ \text{Hourly Profit} = \$9 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} \$9 per hour.<|im_end|>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine how much land Mr. Ruther originally owned.
Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally owned as L.

Step 2: Calculate what fraction of his land was sold.
Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land.

Step 3: Set up an equation based on the information given.
We know that after selling \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, he has 12.8 hectares left.

This can be represented mathematically as:
\[L - \left(L \times \frac{3}{5}\right) = 12.8\]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
\[L - \frac{3}{5}L = 12.8\]
\[\frac{2}{5}L = 12.8\]

Step 5: Solve for \(L\).
Multiply both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[L = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}\]
\[L = 64\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally owned 64 hectares of land.

The final answer is:
The final answer is: 64 hectares<|im_end|>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.

To determine how many people sang in the performance, let's break down the information step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total number of girls in the choir:**
   - There are 52 members in total.
   - Half of these members are boys (50%), so the other half must be girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
   \]

2. **Determine the number of teachers who will join the performance:**
   - It's stated that the choir's 3 teachers will join the performance.

3. **Calculate the total number of people initially available for the performance:**
   - Total choir members: 52
   - Girls: 26
   - Teachers: 3
   \[
   \text{Total initial performers} = 26 + 3 = 29

4. **Determine how many people were not able to reach the performance due to their buses breaking down:**
   - Half of those initially available do not make it to the performance.
   \[
   \text{People unable to reach the performance} = \frac{29}{2} = 14.5 \approx 15 \text{ (rounding up since you can't have half a person)}

5. **Subtract the number of people unable to reach from the total initial performers:**
   - People unable to reach: 15
   - Initial performers: 29

     \[
     \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
     \]
     \[
     \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = 22
     \]

3. **Sum the total number of messages delivered:**
   - Add the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
     \[
     \text{Total Messages} = 66 + 22
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Messages} = 88
     \]

                    question:
                    David and Dasha went to . the carnival, where there are , 9 , rides.  ? Each ride : costs , 2 ride tickets at . $2 : per ticket.  You can also buy a ride ? bracelet for $30 which gives : you ; 9 rides.  If David buys a , ride ; bracelet , and : Dasha buys tickets, : and they ride ; all 9 rides, how much money does David ? save?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money David saves compared to Dasha, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost if both David and Dasha buy tickets:**
   - There are 9 rides.
   - Each ride costs 2 tickets.
   - Total number of tickets needed = \(9 \times 2 = 18\) tickets.
   - Each ticket costs $2.
   - Total cost for tickets = \(18 \times 2 = 36\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost if both David and Dasha use bracelets:**
   - There are 9 rides.
   - A bracelet allows 9 rides.
   - Cost of one bracelet = $30.
   - Since both use bracelets, they will need 2 bracelets (one for each).
   - Total cost for bracelets = \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

3. **Compare the two scenarios:**

   - If both buy tickets, the total cost is $36.
   - If both use bracelets, the total cost is $60.

4. **Determine the savings:**
   - Savings = Cost if buying tickets - Cost if using bracelets
   - Savings = $36 - $60 = -$24 (This means David saves $24).

5. **Verify the calculations:**
   - For David: He buys one ride bracelet and 8 tickets.
   - For Dasha: She buys 9 tickets.
   - Total cost for David = Cost of one bracelet + 8 times the cost of a ticket.
     \[ \text{Cost for David} = \$30 + 8 \times \$2 = \$30 + \$16 = \$46 \]
   - Total cost for Dasha = Cost of 9 tickets.
     \[ \text{Cost for Dasha} = \$2 \times 9 = \$18 \]

Since David's total cost ($46) is greater than Dasha's total cost ($18), David indeed saves money.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{-24}$ (David saves $24).<|im_end|>","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.

   - Gifts for friends: 4
   - Gifts for teachers: 2
   
   Total gifts = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12

2. **Determine how much ribbon is needed per gift bow:**
   - Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
   - She wants to make a bow for each gift.

3. **Calculate the length of ribbon per bow:**
   Since there are 12 bows (one for each gift), we divide the total ribbon by the number of bows:
   
   Ribbon per bow = Total ribbon / Number of bows
                   = 144 inches / 12 bows
                   = 12 inches per bow

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty given their ratio and the total number of popsicles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio**:
   - The ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6.
   - This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

2. **Set Up Proportions**:
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of popsicles Betty has.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of popsicles Sam has.
   - According to the ratio, we can write the proportion as:
     \[
     \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6}
     \]

3. **Express Total Number of Popsicles**:
   - We know the total number of popsicles is 165.
   - Therefore, \( B + S = 165 \).

4. **Use the Proportion to Express One Variable in Terms of Another**:
   - From the proportion, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( B \):
     \[
     S = \frac{6}{5}B
     \]

5. **Substitute into the Total Equation**:
   - Substitute \( S \) from the above expression into the total equation:
     \[
     B + \frac{6}{5}B = 165
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{11}{5}B = 165
     \]

6. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     11B = 825
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     B = \frac{825}{11} = 75
     \]

7. **Find \( S \)**:
   - Now that we know \( B \), substitute it back into the expression for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{6}{5} \times 75 = 90
     \]

8. **Calculate How Many More Popsicles Sam Has**:
   - Subtract \( B \) from \( S \):
     \[
     S - B = 90 - 75 = 15
     \]

### Conclusion:
Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 15.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.

Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 a . month each but he ! saves 20% ; for bundling.  : How much money does ; he save by cancelling ! his , $60 cable package?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Tim would pay if he continued with his current cable package.
2. Determine the savings from bundling different streaming services.
3. Compare the two amounts to find out the overall savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Tim would pay with his current cable package

Tim's current cable package costs $60 per month. Therefore, if he continues with this plan, he will pay $60 every month.

### Step 2: Determine the savings from bundling different streaming services

- **Netflix**: The regular price is $10 per month. With a 20% discount on bundling, he pays $8 (since \(10 \times 0.8 = 8\)).
- **Hulu**: The regular price is also $10 per month. With a 20% discount on bundling, he pays $8 (since \(10 \times 0.8 = 8\)).
- **Disney+**: The regular price is also $10 per month. With a 20% discount on bundling, he pays $8 (since \(10 \times 0.8 = 8\)).

Since he can choose between Netflix, Hulu, or Disney+, let's assume he chooses one of them for simplicity in calculation. Let's calculate the total savings based on choosing Netflix.

- Regular Netflix cost: $10
- Bundled Netflix cost: $8
- Savings: $10 - $8 = $2

This method applies similarly to the other options; the savings remain the same regardless of which service he chooses because all three have the same discounted price.

### Step 3: Compare the two amounts to find out the overall savings

If Tim cancels his cable package and uses the saved money for another purpose, he would be saving at least $2 per month ($2 x number of months).

However, since the exact number of months isn't specified, we'll consider that he could use the savings towards other expenses like subscriptions to other streaming services or directly towards paying off his cable bill.

So, the minimum monthly savings from cancelling his cable package and using the saved money elsewhere is:

**$2**

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $2.<|im_end|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20
By bundling he saves 20*.2=$<<20*.2=4>>4
So in total it cost 20-4=$<<20-4=16>>16
So he pays 16+10=$<<16+10=26>>26 for streaming
That means he saves 60-26=$<<60-26=34>>34 a month

To determine what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on recording**:
   - Carol spends half as much time recording as she does writing.
   - She writes for 4 hours.
   - Therefore, she records for \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours.

2. **Sum up all the times**:
   - Writing: 4 hours
   - Recording: 2 hours
   - Editing: 90 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)

3. **Add up the total time**:
   - Total time = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   - Percentage = (Time spent editing / Total time) × 100%
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100\% = 20\%

To determine how many books Wendy needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Double the Number of Books:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the current number of books.
   - According to the problem, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the current number of books.

2. **Express the Desired Number of Books Mathematically:**
   - Double the current number of books can be represented as \( 2B \).
   - Adding 20 more gives us \( 2B + 20 \).

3. **Determine the Total Number of Columns and Rows:**
   - There are 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of positions (or slots) for books is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \).

4. **Set Up an Equation Based on the Total Number of Slots:**
   - The total number of books needed should equal the total number of slots available.
   - Thus, \( 2B + 20 = 36 \).

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation: 
     \[
     2B = 36 - 20
     \]
     \[
     2B = 16
     \]

6. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{16}{2}
     \]
     \[
     B = 8
     \]

7. **Find the Desired Number of Books:**
   - Substitute \( B = 8 \) back into the expression \( 2B + 20 \):
     \[
     2B + 20 = 2(8) + 20
     \]
     \[
     2B + 20 = 16 + 20

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cards Erica initially has.
2. Subtract the number of cards she passed out.
3. Add the number of cards she received.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards Erica initially has**

Erica made 20 cards herself and received 2 boxes of pre-made cards. Each box contains 15 cards.

\[
\text{Total initial cards} = 20 \text{ (her own)} + 2 \times 15 \text{ (boxes from dad)}
\]

\[
= 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards}
\]

So, Erica starts with 50 cards.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of cards she passed out**

She passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family.

\[
\text{Cards passed out} = 24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards}
\]

Subtracting the passed-out cards from the initial total:

\[
\text{Remaining cards after passing out} = 50 - 29 = 21 \text{ cards}
\]

**Step 3: Add the number of cards she received**

She received 17 more cards from her family and friends.

\[
\text{Final number of cards} = 21 + 17 = 38 \text{ cards}
\]

Therefore, Erica now has **38 Valentine's Day cards**.<|im_end|>","Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of slices given to Bill**

Jenny gives Bill \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total slices.

Total slices = 12

Bill's share = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \)

\( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \)

So, Bill gets 4 slices.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of slices given to Mark**

Jenny gives Mark \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total slices.

Mark's share = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \)

\( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \)

So, Mark gets 3 slices.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices given away**

Sum of Bill's and Mark's shares = Bill's share + Mark's share

= 4 (for Bill) + 3 (for Mark)

= 7 slices

**Step 4: Subtract the total slices given away from the original amount**

Total slices - Slices given away = Remaining slices

= 12 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away)

= 5 slices remaining

**Step 5: Add the slices Jenny ate**

Jenny eats 2 slices.

Remaining slices after Jenny eats = Remaining slices + Slices eaten by Jenny

= 5 (remaining slices) + 2 (slices eaten by Jenny)

= 7 slices

Therefore, the final answer is that there are **7 slices left**.<|im_end|>","First find how many slices 1/3 of the pizza is by multiplying 1/3 by the total number of slices: 12 slices * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 slices

To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy the bike, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total amount Mark currently has.
Mark starts with $50 in his bank account.

### Step 2: Calculate how much more money Mark needs to buy the bike.
The bike costs $300. Subtract the current amount from the cost of the bike:
\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$300 - \$50 = \$250 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much money Mark earns per day.
Mark earns $10 per day.

### Step 4: Calculate how many days it will take for Mark to earn $250 if he continues earning $10 per day.

                    ? Nancy is cleaning out ? her old woodshed. She ; saw ? 90 spiders, 1/3rd as : many millipedes as spiders, and a number of ? stink bugs , equal : to twice the number ? of millipedes ; minus 12. How many bugs : did she count total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many different types of insects Nancy counted in her old woodshed. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of millipedes
We know that there were 90 spiders and that there was one-third as many millipedes as spiders.

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{\text{Number of spiders}}{3} \]

Given that there are 90 spiders,

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

So far, we have:
- Spiders: 90
- Millipedes: 30

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stinkbugs
Nancy found a number of stinkbugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

\[ \text{Number of stinkbugs} = 2 \times (\text{Number of millipedes}) - 12 \]

Substitute the number of millipedes (30) into the equation:

\[ \text{Number of stinkbugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of stinkbugs} = 60 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of stinkbugs} = 48 \]

So far, we have:
- Spiders: 90
- Millipedes: 30
- Stinkbugs: 48

### Step 3: Sum up all the insects
Now, let's add up all the insect counts:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Spiders} + \text{Millipedes} + \text{Stinkbugs} \]
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 168 \]

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of **168** bugs.<|im_end|>","First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes
Then multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs
Then subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs
Then add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the age differences between Alice, Beth, and Erica.

1. **Determine Beth's age:**
   - We know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
   - Let \( A \) represent Alice's age and \( B \) represent Beth's age.
   - From the given information, \( A = B + 7 \).

2. **Determine Erica's age:**
   - We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
   - Let \( E \) represent Erica's age.
   - Therefore, \( B = E + 5 \).
   - Since \( B = A \), we can substitute \( A \) for \( B \):
     \[
     A = E + 5
     \]

3. **Substitute \( A \) in terms of \( E \):**
   - Substitute \( A = E + 5 \) into \( A = B + 7 \):
     \[
     E + 5 = (E + 5) + 7
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     E + 5 = E + 12
     \]
   - Subtract \( E \) from both sides:
     \[
     5 = 12
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     5 = 12
     \]

4. **Solve for \( E \):**
   - Solve the simplified equation:
     \[
     E = 12 - 5
     \]
     \[
     E = 7
     \]

So, Erica is indeed 30 years old.

5. **Find the difference between Alice and Erica's ages:**
   - Since \( A = B + 7 \) and \( B = E + 5 \), and \( B = E + 5 \), it follows that \( A = E + 12 \).
   - Therefore, the difference between Alice and Erica's ages is:
     \[
     A - E = (E + 12) - E = 12
     \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \(\boxed{12}\).<|im_end|>","Beth is 30+5 = <<30+5=35>>35 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings based on the given working hours per month and daily pay rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of days in a month:**
   - We know that the builder works for 6 days every week.
   - There are approximately 30 days in a month (considering a typical month has about 28 or 31 days).

2. **Determine the total number of weeks worked in a year:**
   - The builder works for 4 weeks every month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Total Weeks in Year} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

3. **Calculate the total number of days worked in a year:**
   - Since there are 6 days worked every week,

\[ \text{Total Days in Year} = 6 \times 48 = 288 \]

4. **Calculate the total amount earned in a year:**
   - The builder earns $50 every day.

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 288 \times 50 = \$14,400 \]

Therefore, the builder earns a total of $\$14,400$ if he works for a year.

### Final Answer:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour needed
Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The original recipe calls for 3 cups of flour.

- Original recipe flour = 3 cups
- Quadruple batch flour = 4 × 3 cups = 12 cups

### Step 2: Determine how much flour is in one bag
Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.

- Number of bags needed = Total flour required ÷ Flour per bag
- Number of bags needed = 12 cups ÷ 2 cups/bag
- Number of bags needed = 6 bags

### Step 3: Calculate the number of cups of milk needed
The original recipe calls for 1 cup of milk.

- Original recipe milk = 1 cup
- Quadruple batch milk = 4 × 1 cup = 4 cups

### Step 4: Determine how much milk is in one bottle
Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

- Number of bottles needed = Total milk required ÷ Milk per bottle
- Number of bottles needed = 4 cups ÷ 2 cups/bottle
- Number of bottles needed = 2 bottles

### Step 5: Compare the number of bags and bottles needed
- Bags of flour needed = 6
- Bottles of milk needed = 2

### Step 6: Find out how many more bags of flour are needed compared to bottles of milk
Difference = Bags of flour - Bottles of milk
Difference = 6 - 2 = 4

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.<|im_end|>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.

To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total energy used per day.
2. Determine the reduction in usage after reducing the time by 5 hours.
3. Calculate the daily savings based on the reduced usage.
4. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days (30).

Step 1: Calculate the total energy used per day.

Given:
- Power consumption = 900 watts
- Time used per day = 8 hours

Energy used per day = Power × Time
= 900 watts × 8 hours
= 7200 watt-hours

Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (since 1 kilowatt-hour = 3600 watt-hours):
= 7200 / 3600 kilowatt-hours
= 2 kilowatt-hours

Step 2: Determine the reduction in usage after reducing the time by 5 hours.

Original time used per day = 8 hours
Reduced time = 8 - 5 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the daily savings based on the reduced usage.

Energy saved per day = Original energy use - Reduced energy use
= 2 kilowatt-hours - 3 kilowatt-hours
= -1 kilowatt-hour

Since the calculation shows a negative value, it indicates that Mel would actually consume more energy if he reduces his usage instead of saving money.

Step 4: Multiply the daily savings by the number of days (30).

Daily savings = -1 kilowatt-hour
Number of days = 30

Total savings over 30 days = Daily savings × Number of days
= (-1) kilowatt-hour/day × 30 days
= -30 kilowatt-hours

Conclusion:
Mel saves 30 kilowatt-hours over 30 days. The final answer is: {The final answer is} -30 kilowatt-hours.<|im_end|>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of stripes for each zebra:**
   - The first zebra has 17 stripes.
   - The second zebra has 36 stripes.
   - The third zebra has half as many stripes as the second one.

2. **Calculate the number of stripes on the third zebra:**
   \[
   \text{Number of stripes on the third zebra} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Sum up all the stripes from the three zebras:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of stripes} = 17 + 36 + 18
   \]
   
4. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   17 + 36 = 53
   \]
   \[
   53 + 18 = 71

So, the total number of stripes across the three zebras is 71.

5. **Find the average number of stripes per zebra:**
   \[
   \text{Average number of stripes} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average number of stripes} = \frac{71}{3}

6. **Divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:**
   \[
   \text{Average number of stripes} = \frac{71}{3} \approx 23.67

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tyson will spend on making the sandwiches to serve 20 people. We'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed**
Tyson needs enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat, he needs 20 sandwiches.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat needed**
Each sandwich uses 1 pound of meat. Therefore, for 20 sandwiches, he needs:
\[ \text{Total pounds of meat} = 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat**
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. For 20 pounds, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 20 \times \$7.00 = \$140.00 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of cheese needed**
Since each sandwich also requires 1 pound of cheese, for 20 sandwiches, he needs:
\[ \text{Total pounds of cheese} = 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the cost of the cheese**
The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. For 20 pounds, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 20 \times \$3.00 = \$60.00 \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total cost of both meat and cheese**
The total cost of the ingredients (meat + cheese) is:

                    Elliott ! is trying to walk : 10,000 steps , a . day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took in total and then find out how many steps he took during his jog.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Total Steps**: 10,000 steps per day.
2. **Steps Left After Jog**: 2,000 steps.

First, let's calculate the number of steps Elliott has completed so far:

- Half of his steps: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \) steps.
- Another 1,000 steps (halfway to go): \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \) steps.
- Realized that after jogging, he still needed 2,000 more steps: \( 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 \) steps remaining.

So, Elliott has completed 4,000 steps before starting his jog.

Now, let's add up all the steps he has taken:

- Completed steps: \( 4,000 \)
- Steps in half his daily goal: \( 5,000 \)
- Steps walking to and from school: \( 1,000 \)
- Steps walking with friend: \( 1,000 \)
- Steps jogging: Let's call this \( x \).

We know that the sum of these steps equals the total steps he needs to complete his daily goal:

\[ 4,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 + 1,000 + x = 10,000 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 9,000 + x = 10,000 \]

Subtracting 9,000 from both sides:

\[ x = 10,000 - 9,000 \]
\[ x = 1,000 \]

Therefore, Elliott took 1,000 steps during his jog.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many minutes early Toby will arrive at the airport, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages in the book.
Given:
- The book is 45 pages long.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of words in the book.
Given:
- The average number of words per page is 200.

Total words = Number of pages × Words per page
\[ \text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how long it will take Toby to finish reading the book.
Given:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book = Total words ÷ Words per minute
\[ \text{Time to read the book} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time from when Toby starts reading until he reaches the airport.
Given:
- It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.

Total time for journey + Time to read the book = \( 10 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \)

### Step 5: Subtract the travel time from the total time available before leaving.
Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes but it takes him 40 minutes just to reach there. Therefore, he has extra time.

Extra time available = Total time before departure - Total journey time
\[ \text{Extra time} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 40 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

### Conclusion:
Toby will be **20 minutes** early. 

Thus, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is: 20 minutes}}
\]<|im_end|>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to its employees over two months (May and June). Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly payment per employee
First, let's determine how much Carolyn earns per month from her employment at the delivery service company.

- Number of hours worked per week: \(40\)
- Hours per pay period: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weeks (since there are 4 weeks in an average work week)
- Hourly wage: \$15

So, the total number of hours worked per month is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks/month} = 320 \text{ hours/month} \]

Now, let's calculate the total earnings per month:
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 320 \text{ hours/month} \times \$15/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = \$4800 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of employees working in each month
Given that the company hired 40 employees in May:

- Employees working in May: 40

In June, half of these employees’ contracts expired:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ employees} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payments for May
Since all 40 employees were working in May, we can now calculate the total payments made during May:
\[ \text{Total Payments in May} = 40 \text{ employees} \times \$4800/\text{employee} \]
\[ \text{Total Payments in May} = \$192,000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total payments for June
For June, only 20 employees were still working:
\[ \text{Total Payments in June} = 20 \text{ employees} \times \$4800/\text{employee} \]
\[ \text{Total Payments in June} = \$96,000 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total payments over both months
Finally, add the payments from May and June to get the total amount paid out:
\[ \text{Total Payment Over Two Months} = \$192,000 + \$96,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Payment Over Two Months} = \$288,000 \]

### Conclusion
The total amount of money the company paid to its employees in the two months (May and June) is **\$288,000**.<|im_end|>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Sally's Vacation Expenses**:
   - Parents gave Sally $10.
   - The total cost of items purchased: 
     - Taffy (mixed bag): $1.50
     - Mags ($0.25 each): 4 * $0.25 = $1.00
     - Total: $1 + $1.50 + $1 = $3.50

2. **Total Money Given**: Sally had $10 from her parents.

3. **Subtracting the Cost**: Subtract the total cost of items from what Sally received from her parents.
   
   \[
   \$10 - \$3.50 = \$6.50
   \]

So, after purchasing all the items, Sally has $6.50 left.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $6.50.<|im_end|>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

When you add all her purchases, $4.50+$1.50+$1.00 = $<<4.5+1.5+1=7.00>>7.00

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Tim spent on fireworks and other items. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the two packages of fireworks
- The first package of fireworks is worth $400.
- The second package is worth twice as much as the first package, so it is worth $800.

Total cost of both packages before discount:
\[ \text{Total} = \$400 + \$800 = \$1200 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 20% discount
A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

Discounted total cost:
\[ \text{Discounted Total} = \$1200 \times 0.80 = \$960 \]

### Step 3: Add the cost of the finale fireworks
The finale fireworks cost $150.

Final total cost:
\[ \text{Final Total} = \$960 + \$150 = \$1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cookies needed per day
Shannon wants to have enough cookies for 30 days. Therefore, we need to calculate how many cookies are required per day.

- Number of cookies per night: 2
- Number of nights per week: 7 (assuming a typical workweek)
- Number of weeks in 30 days: \( \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.2857 \) weeks (we'll round up to 5 weeks)

So, the total number of cookies needed per day over 5 weeks is:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 7 \text{ nights/week} = 14 \text{ cookies/day} \]

Now, multiply this by the number of days:
\[ 14 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cookies} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies needed for 30 days
We already calculated that 420 cookies are needed for 30 days.

### Step 3: Convert the number of cookies into dozens
Since one dozen equals 12 cookies, we can convert the total number of cookies into dozens by dividing by 12.
\[ \frac{420 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 35 \text{ dozens} \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Shannon needs to make **35 dozen** cookies to last her for 30 days.<|im_end|>","She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine the total number of candles that will explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that will smell like wet dog.
3. Calculate how many candles will be both exploding and smelling like wet dog.

### Step 1: Determine the number of candles that will explode

Marcy guarantees her candles are 99% safe from explosion. Therefore, out of every 100 candles, only 1 candle explodes.

Given that she makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the expected number of exploding candles as follows:

\[
\text{Number of exploding candles} = \frac{1}{100} \times 50,000 = 500
\]

So, approximately 500 candles will explode.

### Step 2: Determine the number of candles that will smell like wet dog

Out of every 100 candles, 5% will have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, for every 100 candles, 5 will have this defect.

Given that she makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the expected number of candles that will smell like wet dog as follows:

\[
\text{Number of candles smelling like wet dog} = \frac{5}{100} \times 50,000 = 2,500
\]

So, approximately 2,500 candles will smell like wet dog.

### Step 3: Calculate how many candles will be both exploding and smelling like wet dog

Since the defective candles (smelling like wet dog) are a subset of those that might explode, we need to determine if any of these candles could explode. Given that 5% of the candles smell like wet dog, all of these candles would potentially explode because they meet the criteria for being explosive.

Therefore, since all 2,500 candles that smell like wet dog will also explode, there will be no candles that both smell like wet dog and explode simultaneously.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

1. **Calculate the number of blouses purchased:**
   - Misha picks out 4 blouses.

2. **Determine the regular price of one blouse:**
   - Each blouse costs $20.

3. **Calculate the total regular cost before discount:**
   - Total cost = Number of blouses × Regular price per blouse

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of apples Joanne's sister collects:**
   - Joanne gathers three different amounts of apples.
   - Her sister gathers twice as much from the tallest trees.
   - Her sister gathers three times as much from the shortest trees.
   - The rest go to the average trees (which she does not collect).

2. **Calculate the total apples collected by both sisters:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of apples collected by Joanne's sister.
   - Then, Joanne's sister collects \( 2A \) apples from the tallest trees and \( 3A \) apples from the shortest trees.
   - Therefore, the total apples collected by both sisters is \( A + 2A + 3A = 6A \).
   - According to the problem, they together have gathered 500 apples.
     So, \( 6A = 500 \).
     Solving for \( A \), we get \( A = \frac{500}{6} \approx 83.33 \).

3. **Find out how many apples Joanne collected from the average trees:**
   - Since Joanne's sister has already taken care of the other two types of trees, the remaining apples must be from the average trees.
   - Joanne collects all the apples from the average trees because she doesn’t take any from there.

4. **Calculate the total number of apples Joanne gathered:**
   - We know that the total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples Joanne gathered is also 500.

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}
\]<|im_end|>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                    question:
                    : A herd consists of camels : and dromedaries. There are 180 heads ? and 304 ; bumps. ? How many dromedaries are there if camels ? have ! two ? humps each and , dromedaries have one hump each?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in the herd based on the given information about the total number of heads (which includes both camels and dromedaries) and the total number of bumps (which represents the number of humps).

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels,
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

Given:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of bumps is 304.

We know that:
- Each camel has 2 humps.
- Each dromedary has 1 hump.

First, let's set up equations based on the given information:

1. Since each head belongs either to a camel or a dromedary, the total number of heads can be represented as:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of bumps can also be expressed as:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]
   Here, \( 2C \) accounts for the humps of all the camels, and \( D \) accounts for the humps of all the dromedaries.

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
C + D = 180 \\
2C + D = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To find \( C \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]
Simplify:
\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

Substitute \( C = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[
124 + D = 180
\]
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

So, the number of dromedaries is **56**.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down Tom's journey into different segments and calculate the total distance traveled.

1. **First Four Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for 4 days.
   - Total distance for these 4 days = \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

2. **Next Two Days:**
   - Over these two days, Tom traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days.
   - Distance covered in these two days = \(800 \text{ km} \times 30\% = 240 \text{ km}\).

3. **Remaining Days:**
   - After the last two days, Tom didn’t travel any more.
   - So, the remaining distance must be covered in the other six days (since there were 7 days in total).
   - Let’s denote the distance traveled on the sixth day as \(x\) km.
   - The distance traveled on the seventh day will also be \(x\) km since it was not mentioned that he stopped completely.
   - Since he traveled 300 km per day for the entire second week, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + x = 600 \text{ km}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2x = 600 \implies x = 300 \text{ km}
     \]

So, Tom traveled 300 km on both the sixth and seventh days.

4. **Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Adding up all the distances, we have:
     \[
     800 \text{ km (first four days)} + 240 \text{ km (next two days)} + 300 \text{ km (sixth day)} + 300 \text{ km (seventh day)} = 1640 \text{ km}
     \]

Therefore, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{1640}\) kilometers.<|im_end|>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker based on the given information about the sizes of Zack's and Peter's lockers.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack's locker.
   - Peter's locker has an area of \(5\) cubic inches.
   - Therefore, Zack's locker must be \(4\) times bigger than Peter's locker because \(\frac{1}{4} \times 4 = 1\).

2. **Calculate the size of Zack's locker:**
   - Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker,
   - Zack's locker is \(2\) times smaller than Timothy's locker (because \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\)).
   - So, if Zack's locker is \(1\) unit of volume, then Timothy's locker would be \(2\) units of volume.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The size of Timothy's locker is \(2\) cubic inches.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the difference in elevation between Stanley and Oliver.
Stanley is at 10,000 feet elevation, while Oliver is at 3,000 feet elevation.

Difference in elevation = 10,000 feet - 3,000 feet = 7,000 feet

### Step 2: Calculate how much farther Oliver needs to climb compared to Stanley.
Since Oliver is already higher than Stanley (by 7,000 feet), we need to determine how far Stanley has fallen from his original position before reaching the ledge.

Given that Stanley fell 4,000 feet to reach the ledge, we can calculate how high above Stanley's current location Oliver should be.

Total distance Stanley falls = 4,000 feet + 7,000 feet (remaining elevation) = 11,000 feet

Now, subtract this total distance from Oliver's starting elevation to find out how much more Oliver needs to climb.

Oliver's elevation = 3,000 feet
Remaining distance for Oliver = 11,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb **8,000 feet** to reach the same elevation as Stanley's comb.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of feet Oliver must climb to reach Stanley's comb is **8,000 feet**.<|im_end|>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has after receiving donations from both banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount donated by the second bank:**
   - The second bank gave Mr. Josue twice as much as the first bank.
   - The first bank gave $4000.
   - Therefore, the second bank gave \( 2 \times 4000 = \$8000\).

2. **Sum up all the donations received:**
   - First bank donation: $4000
   - Second bank donation: $8000
   - Initial capital: $5000

   Adding these together gives us the total amount of capital Mr. Josue currently has:
   \[
   4000 + 8000 + 5000 = \$17000

   - Total number of cats carried away = \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Number of cats remaining after some have been carried away: \(50 - 20 = 30\).

3. **Cats run to chase the mouse**:
   - After running, only one-third of the remaining cats (which was 30) are chased by the mouse.
   - Number of cats chased by the mouse: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10\).
   - Cats that did not run after the mouse: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

To determine how much Bill would pay over 2 years after his initial discounts, let's break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost during the introductory period (first 6 months)

- The introductory rate is $8 per month.
- Duration of this period = 6 months.

Total cost during the introductory period:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8 \times 6 = \$48 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost during the next 2 months at the normal rate

- Normal rate after the introductory period is $12 per month.
- Duration of this period = 2 months.

Total cost during the normal rate period:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12 \times 2 = \$24 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost from month 9 onwards

After reaching the normal rate, the service increases to $14 per month.

- Total duration beyond the introductory period = \( 24 - 6 = 18 \) months.
- Rate remains at $14 per month.

Total cost for the remaining 18 months:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 14 \times 18 = \$252 \]

### Step 4: Sum all costs to get the total amount paid over 2 years

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = 48 + 24 + 252 = \$324 \]

Therefore, the total amount Bill pays over 2 years is {The final answer is}: \$324.<|im_end|>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.

He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the Cost of Tattered Jeans
- Cole bought two pairs of jeans.
- Let \( T \) be the cost of one pair of tattered jeans.
- Given that Cole saved a total of $6.

Since Cole saved 1/3 of his savings from the joggers, let's denote:
- \( S_j \) as the amount Cole saved from the joggers.
- \( S_t \) as the amount Cole saved from the tattered jeans.

Given that Cole saved 1/3 of his savings from the joggers, we can write:
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} (S_j + S_t) \]

From this equation, it's clear that \( S_t \) must be equal to \( S_j \), because:
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{4} S_j + \frac{1}{4} S_j \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{4} (T - 6) \]

Since \( S_j = S_t \), then:
\[ T - 6 = \frac{1}{4} (T - 6) \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T - 6 = \frac{T - 6}{4} \]
\[ 4(T - 6) = T - 6 \]
\[ 4T - 24 = T - 6 \]
\[ 3T = 18 \]
\[ T = 6 \]

So, the cost of one pair of tattered jeans is $6.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Savings
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- This means he spent $12 on the tattered jeans (since he bought two).

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of Jogger Jeans
- Cole also bought two pairs of jogger jeans at a discounted price.
- Let \( J \) be the cost of one pair of jogger jeans.
- The difference in cost between the tattered and jogger jeans is $6 less.

From the given information:
\[ J = T - 6 \]
\[ J = 6 - 6 \]
\[ J = 0 \]

This doesn't make sense since the cost cannot be zero. Instead, consider the total savings:
\[ S_j = S_t \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} (S_j + S_t) \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} (S_j + S_j) \]
\[ S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 2S_j \]
\[ S_j = \frac{2}{3} S_j \]

Thus, Cole saved half of what he would have saved if he didn't buy the jogger jeans. So, if he had saved all $6 from the tattered jeans, he could have saved another $6 from the jogger jeans.

### Step 4: Final Calculation
To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost compared to the tattered jeans:
\[ J = T + 6 \]
\[ J = 6 + 6 \]
\[ J = 12 \]

Therefore, the original cost of one pair of jogger jeans is $12, which is $6 more than the cost of one pair of tattered jeans.<|im_end|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many employees can join the day trip given the different types of vehicles available.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats in the buses:**
   - There are 4 buses.
   - Each bus has a capacity of 60 employees.
   \[
   \text{Total seats in buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seats in the minibusses:**
   - There are 6 minibusses.
   - Each minibuss has a capacity of 30 employees.
   \[
   \text{Total seats in minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of seats in the minivans:**
   - There are 10 minivans.
   - Each minivan has a capacity of 15 employees.
   \[
   \text{Total seats in minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. **Sum up all the seat capacities:**
   \[
   \text{Total seating capacity} = \text{Seats in buses} + \text{Seats in minibusses} + \text{Seats in minivans}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total seating capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ seats}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**.

Ending note: The final answer is: The final answer is 570.<|im_end|>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many birds Lillian will expect to see at her garden's bird feeders each day based on the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of bird feeders Lillian has:**
   - Lillian adds 3 bird feeders.
   - She also buys 3 more bird feeders from stores.
   - Total bird feeders = 3 (her own) + 3 (store-bought) = 6 bird feeders.

2. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted by these feeders:**
   - Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by all feeders combined = 6 (feeders) × 20 (birds per feeder) = 120 birds per day.

3. **Adjust for the preference between store-bought and homemade feeders:**
   - The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds per feeder than store-bought ones.
   - Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each homemade feeder attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds.
   - Since there are 3 store-bought feeders and 3 homemade feeders, the average number of birds attracted per feeder is (20 + 30)/2 = 25 birds per feeder.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by all feeders combined = 3 (store-bought feeders) × 25 (birds per store-bought feeder) + 3 (homemade feeders) × 25 (birds per homemade feeder) = 75 + 75 = 150 birds per day.

4. **Account for the fact that not all feeders may be used every day:**
   - If only half of the feeders are used each day, then the expected number of birds would be half of the total daily count.
   - Expected number of birds per day = 150 / 2 = 75 birds.

### Final Answer:
Lillian can expect to see approximately 75 birds in her garden each day. {The final answer is} 75 birds.<|im_end|>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the soup:**
   - The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
   - The bagel costs $4.

   \[
   \text{Soup Cost} = \text{Bagel Cost} + (\text{Bagel Cost} \times 0.25)
   \]

   \[
   \text{Soup Cost} = \$4 + (4 \times 0.25) = \$4 + \$1 = \$5
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the soup and bagel together:**

   \[
   \text{Total Soup and Bagel Cost} = \text{Soup Cost} + \text{Bagel Cost}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Soup and Bagel Cost} = \$5 + \$4 = \$9
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the cake:**
   - The cake is only half the price of the bagel.

   \[
   \text{Cake Cost} = \frac{\text{Bagel Cost}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Cake Cost} = \frac{\$4}{2} = \$2
   \]

4. **Sum up all the costs to find out how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her meal:**

   \[
   \text{Total Meal Cost} = \text{Soup Cost} + \text{Bagel Cost} + \text{Cake Cost}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Meal Cost} = \$5 + \$4 + \$2 = \$11
   \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.<|im_end|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine how much money Kenny spends on the amusement park ticket.
Kenny needs to spend $100 on an amusement park ticket. 

### Step 2: Calculate how much money remains after buying the ticket.
\[ \text{Remaining Money} = \$100 - \$100 = \$0 \]

Since there is no remaining money after buying the ticket, let's assume that all the collected Pokémon cards were sold at their face value (since they cost $1 per card).

### Step 3: Set up the equation based on the information provided.
- Kenny starts with \( x \) Pokémon cards.
- He sells \( \frac{x}{3} \) cards at $1.5 each.
- The total revenue from selling these cards is \( \frac{x}{3} \times 1.5 \).
- After selling these cards, he still has \( \frac{2x}{3} \) cards left.

### Step 4: Formulate the equation based on the given information about the remaining cards.
Let's denote the number of Pokémon cards as \( n \). Since he kept \( \frac{n}{3} \) cards and spent some of them, the remaining cards should be equal to \( \frac{n}{3} \).

We know that he has enough money left ($50) to pay for the ticket and keep going to the amusement park.

### Step 5: Solve the equation.
Given that he has $50 left, he must have bought the ticket for $100 and then used the remaining $50 to cover other expenses or save some money for future use.

So, if he has \( \frac{n}{3} \) cards left, and he buys the ticket with one-third of his initial collection, then:

\[ \frac{n}{3} = \frac{x}{3} \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \]

This implies:
\[ x = 300 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with **300 Pokémon cards**.<|im_end|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150
He sold 100 cards because 150 / 1.5 = <<150/1.5=100>>100
The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3
He started with 150 cards because 100 / (2/3) = <<100/(2/3)=150>>150

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many hotdogs were initially planned:**
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the guests.
   - There are 36 guests in total.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, the caterer planned to make 18 hotdogs.

2. **Calculate the number of hotdogs actually needed after the increase in attendance:**
   - Initially, the caterer planned for 18 hotdogs.
   - After 40 guests arrived (which is more than expected), everyone wants a second hotdog.
   - Since everyone wants a second hotdog, we need double the initial amount.
   - Therefore, we need \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.

3. **Find out if there are any leftover hotdogs from the initial plan:**
   - We started with 18 hotdogs but ended up needing 36.
   - This means that the caterer originally had enough hotdogs because \( 36 > 18 \).

4. **Determine how many guests didn't get a second hotdog:**
   - The caterer originally planned for 18 hotdogs.
   - With 40 guests arriving, everyone got at least one hotdog.
   - Since everyone got at least one hotdog, no guest who arrived got a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, all 40 guests received their desired quantity of hotdogs.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 0. All guests received their desired quantity of hotdogs.<|im_end|>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.

   - Half of 6 letters is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) letters.

3. **Add 4 to that amount to find out how many letters there are in her sister's name:**
   - The sister's name has \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.

Therefore, Indras' name has 6 letters, and her sister's name has 7 letters.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (at $5.00 each): 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

   Total cost before discount:

2. **Apply the 20% discount:**

   Discounted amount: 
   \[
   \$165.00 \times 0.20 = \$33.00
   \]
   
   Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us:

To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy all three items, we'll follow these steps:

   - Playground ball: $2

   Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

2. **Determine Dora's current savings:**
   - Savings from allowance: $2
   - Money given by mother: $16

   Total savings = $2 + $16 = $18

3. **Subtract Dora's current savings from the total cost to find out how much more she needs:**

   Remaining amount needed = Total cost - Current savings
                          = $19 - $18
                          = $1

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dragons each prince killed based on their weapons and methods.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Prince Thaddeus:
- **Weapon:** Mighty sword
- **Method:** Slew 100 dragons

\[ \text{Dragons killed by Prince Thaddeus} = 100 \]

#### Prince Arthur:
- **Weapon:** Spear
- **Method:** Slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus

\[ \text{Dragons killed by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]

#### Prince Walter:
- **Weapon:** Rusty iron axe
- **Method:** Slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur

\[ \text{Dragons killed by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

#### Prince Bruce:
- **Weapon:** Nail file (implied that he uses no weapon)
- **Method:** Slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter

\[ \text{Dragons killed by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]

                    question:
                    15 gallons of gas . were ; equally divided ! into 5 different containers. . Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her : lawnmower. : How many ! pints of gasoline did , Josey need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Convert gallons to quarts**: 
   - There are 32 ounces in a gallon.
   - Therefore, there are 8 quarts (since 32 ÷ 4 = 8) in a gallon.

2. **Calculate total amount in quarts**:
   - 15 gallons × 8 quarts/gallon = 120 quarts

3. **Divide the total volume among the 5 containers**:
   - 120 quarts ÷ 5 containers = 24 quarts/container

4. **Determine how much gasoline per container**:
   - Since Josey needs 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower,
     - 1 container ÷ 4 = 0.25 containers/joyce

5. **Calculate the amount of gasoline per container**:
   - 24 quarts/container × 0.25 containers/josey = 6 quarts/container

6. **Convert quarts back to pints**:
   - There are 4 quarts in a pint.
   - Therefore, 6 quarts × 4 pints/quart = 24 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 24 pints of gasoline for her lawnmower.

{The final answer is} 24 pints.<|im_end|>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container
(1/4)24 = 6 pints
Josey needed 6 pints of gas for her lawnmower.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on chips:**
   - Chips cost 40 cents per bag.
   - George bought 3 bags of chips.
   - Total cost for chips = \( 3 \times 40 \) cents = \( 120 \) cents.

2. **Determine how much money was spent on candy bars:**
   - George spent a total of $5 (which is 500 cents).
   - Subtract the amount spent on chips from the total spent to find out how much was spent on candy bars.
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on candy bars} = 500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Find out how many candy bars George bought:**
   - Each candy bar costs 75 cents.
   - To find out how many candy bars George bought, divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the price of one candy bar.
     \[
     \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{380}{75} \approx 5.11 \text{ candy bars}
     \]
   - Since George can only buy whole candy bars, we round down to the nearest whole number because partial candy bars aren't possible in practice.

Therefore, George bought **5** candy bars.<|im_end|>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many lollipops were left after Ray kept some:**
   - Ray started with 25 lollipops.
   - He kept 5 lollipops for himself.
   - Therefore, the number of lollipops left to be shared is \( 25 - 5 = 20 \).

2. **Calculate how many lollipops each friend received:**
   - Ray has four friends.
   - These 20 lollipops are shared equally among these four friends.
   - To find out how many lollipops each friend receives, we divide the total number of lollipops left (20) by the number of friends (4).
   - So, each friend gets \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) lollipops.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much the remaining cake weighs after cutting it into 8 equal pieces, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weight of one piece:**
   - The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces.
   - There are 8 pieces in total.
   - To find the weight of one piece, divide the total weight by the number of pieces:
     \[
     \text{Weight of one piece} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weight of one piece} = 2.5 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the weight of the remaining cake:**
   - Since all pieces have been used to cut the cake, the remaining cake will be exactly one piece.
   - Therefore, the weight of the remaining cake is the same as the weight of one piece.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The remaining cake weighs 2.5 ounces.

Thus, the final answer is: The remaining cake weighs {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges:**
   - Sitti bought 34 oranges.
   - Juris bought 22 oranges.
   - Total number of oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris' oranges.

\[
\text{Total number of oranges} = 34 + 22 = 56
\]

2. **Calculate the number of people sharing the oranges:**
   - Both Sitti and Juris decide to share their oranges.
   - They also want to share with their 6 other friends.
   - Number of people sharing the oranges = Sitti + Juris + Friends.

\[
\text{Number of people sharing the oranges} = 2 \text{ (Sitti and Juris)} + 7 \text{ (their friends)}
\]

\[
\text{Number of people sharing the oranges} = 9

<|im_start|>header
To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French Onion Soup, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of onions needed.
Antoine wants to double the original amount of onions specified in the recipe.

Original amount: \(2\) pounds of onions.
Double this amount: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of onions.
Each pound of onions costs \( \$2.00 \).

Total cost of onions: \(4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00\).

### Step 3: Determine how many servings the soup can provide.
The soup serves 6 people.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per serving.
Total cost of onions (\$8.00) will be divided among the 6 servings.

Cost per serving: \(\frac{\$8.00}{6} \approx \$1.33\).

Since the cost must be rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is approximately **\$1.33**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The cost per serving is **\$1.33**.<|im_end|>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the driving distance:**
   - We know that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to drive to the theater.
   - It also takes Bernadette 4 minutes * 4 = 16 minutes to drive to the theater.

2. **Calculate the time difference:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater after 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes earlier to reach on time.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to subtract the time it takes for Wayne (4 minutes) from the time it takes for Bernadette (16 minutes).

So, let's do the math:
\[ \text{Time difference} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive at the theater first. 

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 12 minutes earlier.<|im_end|>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the given dimensions from yards to feet:**
   - We know that \(1\) yard = \(3\) feet.
   - Therefore, if the length of the room is \(3\) yards, then the length in feet is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

2. **Calculate the width of the room:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - Given that the area of the room is \(360\) square feet and the length is \(9\) feet, we can set up the equation for the area as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     360 = 9 \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - To find the width, divide both sides by \(9\):
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: Perimeter = \(2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})\).
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40)
     \]
   - Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (49) = 98 \text{ feet}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many beads each sister has in total and then find out who has more beads.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of beads Elizabeth has.
Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear (unknown) beads

Each pack contains 20 beads.

So, for red beads:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \]

And for clear (unknown) beads:
\[ \text{Clear beads} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Total beads Elizabeth has:
\[ \text{Total beads Elizabeth} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of beads Margareth has.
Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads.

So, for blue beads:
\[ \text{Blue beads} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

And for red beads:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Total beads Margareth has:
\[ \text{Total beads Margareth} = 60 + 80 = 140 \]

### Step 3: Compare the total beads each sister has.
Elizabeth has 60 beads.
Margareth has 140 beads.

### Final Answer:
One sister has **more** beads than the other. The sister with fewer beads is Elizabeth. Therefore, Margareth has **more** beads. The final answer is:

{The final answer is}: Margareth.<|im_end|>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase during baking.
- Marcus spends 3 hours baking.
- The oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.

\[
\text{Temperature Increase} = \text{Hours Baking} \times \text{Increase Per Hour}
\]

\[
\text{Temperature Increase} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 2: Add the initial temperature difference.
- Marcus' house was initially at 40 degrees when he woke up.

\[
\text{Final Temperature Before Cooling Down} = 40 + 15 = 55 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cooling effect due to the window opening.
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
- For every 10 minutes, the house cools down by 2 degrees.

First, calculate how many 10-minute intervals there are in 30 minutes:

\[
\text{Number of Intervals} = \frac{\text{Minutes Open}}{10} = \frac{30}{10} = 3
\]

Now, apply the cooling effect:

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = \text{Number of Intervals} \times \text{Cooling Degree per Interval}
\]

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the cooling effect from the final temperature before cooling down.
\[
\text{Final Temperature After Cooling Down} = \text{Final Temperature Before Cooling Down} - \text{Cooling Effect}
\]

\[
\text{Final Temperature After Cooling Down} = 55 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the house's final temperature is **49 degrees**.<|im_end|>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees

Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and work through it step-by-step.

### Step 1: Convert all times to the same unit (minutes)
- **Swim:** 40 minutes
- **Bike Ride:** 70 minutes (1 hour = 60 minutes + 20 minutes = 80 minutes - 10 minutes difference = 70 minutes)
- **Run:** 50 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate James' total time based on his performance relative to Jon's times.
- **Swim:** Jon swims in 40 minutes, so James swims in \(40 \times 90\% = 36\) minutes.
- **Bike Ride:** Jon bikes in 70 minutes, so James bikes in \(70 \times 95\% = 66.5\) minutes.
  
James also takes 5 more minutes than Jon for the run. So we need to calculate the time he took for the run:

- **Run:** Jon runs in 50 minutes, so James runs in \(50 - 5 = 45\) minutes.

### Step 3: Calculate James' total time.
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Swim} + \text{Bike Ride} + \text{Run} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 36 + 66.5 + 45 \]

Let's perform these calculations:

\[ 36 + 66.5 + 45 = 147.5 \]

So, James' total time is 147.5 minutes.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: James took 147.5 minutes to complete the run.<|im_end|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Movie A was one-fourth the length of , Movie B. Movie B was 5 minutes , longer ? than Movie C. Movie C was ! 1.25 , hours. ! How : many ! minutes . long was Movie A?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert all time units to minutes.
- **Movie C**: Given as 1.25 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert it to minutes.
  \[
  1.25 \text{ hours} = 1.25 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Movie B**: Given as 5 minutes.

### Step 2: Determine how much longer Movie B is compared to Movie C.
- Subtract the duration of Movie C from the duration of Movie B.
  \[
  \text{Difference} = \text{Duration of Movie B} - \text{Duration of Movie C}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 75 \text{ minutes} = -70 \text{ minutes}
  \]

This negative value indicates that Movie C is actually longer than Movie B, not shorter. Let's correct our approach to match the given conditions.

### Corrected Approach:
Given:
- Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
- Movie C is 1.25 hours (or 75 minutes).

Let's denote the duration of Movie A as \( x \) minutes. According to the problem, Movie B is one-fourth the length of Movie A, so:
\[
x = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{(duration of Movie B)}
\]

Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:
\[
\text{Duration of Movie B} = \text{Duration of Movie C} + 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

We know:
\[
\text{Duration of Movie C} = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

So,
\[
\text{Duration of Movie B} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, using the relationship between Movie A and Movie B:
\[
x = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the duration of Movie A.
\[
x = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the duration of Movie A is **20 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = <<75+5=80>>80 minutes

Movie A was <<20=20>>20 minutes long.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse can run in 30 minutes.
- The speed of the horse is given as 32 miles per hour (mph).
- Time available = 30 minutes.

First convert time into hours:
\[ \text{Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1}{60} \text{ hours per minute} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many bails of hay the horse consumes.
- For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- Distance = 16 miles.

Calculate the total number of bails consumed:
\[ \text{Total bails} = \text{Distance} \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
- Each bail costs $3.
- Total bails = 8 bails.

Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of bails} \times \text{Cost per bail} = 8 \times 3 = \$24 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of money left over.
- Michael starts with six $5 bills.
- Amount of money in one bill = $5.
- Number of bills = 6 bills.

Calculate the total amount of money Michael has initially:
\[ \text{Initial Money} = \text{Number of bills} \times \text{Amount per bill} = 6 \times 5 = \$30 \]

Subtract the cost of the hay from the initial amount:
\[ \text{Change Left} = \text{Initial Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 - 24 = \$6 \]

### Final Answer:
After buying the hay, Michael will have $6 left over. {The final answer is}: 6.<|im_end|>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24
Michael has $30 because 6 x $5 = <<6*5=30>>30
Michael has $6 in change because $30 - $24 = $<<30-24=6>>6

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Convert dozens to individual eggs:**
   - Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs.
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - Therefore, she has \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) eggs.

2. **Determine the number of eggs needed per tray:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.
   - Thus, each tray requires \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) eggs.

3. **Calculate the total number of trays needed:**
   - We need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs required per tray.
   - Total number of eggs = 48.
   - Number of eggs per tray = 25.
   - Number of trays = \( \frac{48}{25} = 1.92 \).

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tray, Rozanne will need to round up because even a partial tray would require an egg. So, she needs to use 2 trays.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}: 2 trays.<|im_end|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

   - Joey initially has 214 points.
   - Joey scores an additional 26 points.

   \[
   \text{Joey's total score} = 214 + 26
   \]

   Let's calculate this sum:

   \[
   214 + 26 = 240
   \]

2. **Calculate Marcy's new score:**
   - Marcy starts with 225 points.
   - Marcy then scores 10 more points.

   \[
   \text{Marcy's total score} = 225 + 10
   \]

   Let's perform this calculation:

   \[
   225 + 10 = 235
   \]

3. **Compare Joey's and Marcy's scores to determine the winner:**
   - Joey's current score is 240 points.
   - Marcy's current score is 235 points.

   To find out how many points Joey is ahead, subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:

   \[

To determine the regular price of popcorn given that buying both tickets saved $2, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the regular ticket without discounts:**
   - The regular ticket costs $12.
   - Buying the super ticket saves $2.
   
   Therefore, the savings on the super ticket must be due to the discount on the popcorn.

2. **Determine the total cost of the super ticket including the popcorn and soda:**
   - Super ticket = $20
   - Popcorn + Soda = $5 (since the soda costs $3)

   So, the total cost of the super ticket plus popcorn and soda is:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Subtract the saved amount from the total cost of the super ticket to find the regular price of popcorn:**
   - Savings = $2
   - Total cost after savings = $25
   
   Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is:
   \[
   25 - 5 = 20

   And the regular price of popcorn is $20.

4. **Verify the calculations:**

   - Regular ticket cost: $12
   - Super ticket cost: $20
   - Cost of popcorn: $20
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Total cost of super ticket + popcorn and soda: $25

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial cost per balloon before the price increase.
2. Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase.
3. Find out how many balloons can be filled in two days at the original cost.
4. Determine how many balloons can be filled in one day at the original cost.
5. Use the number of balloons that can be filled in one day to calculate the total cost for 170 balloons.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Determine the initial cost per balloon**

Given:
- Total cost on the first day = $900
- Number of balloons on the first day = 20

Initial cost per balloon = Total cost / Number of balloons
= $900 / 20
= $45

So, the initial cost per balloon is $45.

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase**

New cost per balloon = Initial cost per balloon + Increase per balloon
= $45 + $20
= $65

So, the new cost per balloon is $65.

**Step 3: Find out how many balloons can be filled in two days at the original cost**

Number of balloons filled in two days = Original cost per balloon * Number of days
= $45 * 2
= 90 balloons

So, Bentley can fill 90 balloons in two days at the original cost.

**Step 4: Determine how many balloons can be filled in one day at the original cost**

Number of balloons filled in one day = Original cost per balloon
= $45

So, Bentley can fill 45 balloons in one day at the original cost.

**Step 5: Use the number of balloons that can be filled in one day to calculate the total cost for 170 balloons**

Total cost for 170 balloons = New cost per balloon * Number of balloons
= $65 * 170
= $11,050

So, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{11050}$.<|im_end|>","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45

                    question:
                    ! A car is on a : road ? trip : and drives , 60 mph for 2 , hours, and then 30 mph ; for 1 hour. , What is the . car's average speed in mph during this trip?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To find the average speed of the car over the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance covered at 60 mph:**
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \(60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Calculate the distance covered at 30 mph:**
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Speed = 30 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \(30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance at 60 mph + Distance at 30 mph = \(120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - Time at 60 mph = 2 hours
   - Time at 30 mph = 1 hour
   - Total time = Time at 60 mph + Time at 30 mph = \(2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}\)

5. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = \(150 \text{ miles} / 3 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ mph}\)

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 50 \text{ mph}}
\]<|im_end|>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.
The car drives 30*1=<<30*1=30>>30 miles for 1 hour.
It drives a total of 120+30=<<120+30=150>>150 miles.
Let S be the average speed, M be the number of miles, and H the number of hours spent driving.
Then we have, S=M/H, so, S=150 miles/3 hours = <<150/3=50>>50 mph

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the value of one ruby.
We know that Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. The total value of the sapphires traded in exchange for the rubies is given as $800.

First, let's find out how much one sapphire is worth:
\[ \text{Value of one Sapphire} = \frac{\$800}{3 \text{sapphires}} = \$\frac{800}{3} \]

Next, calculate the value of one ruby (since 2 rubies equal one sapphire):
\[ \text{Value of one Ruby} = \frac{\$800}{2 \text{ rubies}} = \$400 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total value of Jenna’s jewels after the trade.
Jenna initially has 8 sapphires. After trading 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, she will have 5 sapphires left. Therefore, her new total number of jewels is:
\[ \text{Total Jewels after trade} = 8 \text{sapphires} - 3 \text{sapphires} + 2 \text{ rubies} = 7 \text{jewels} \]

### Step 3: Determine the value of the remaining sapphires.
Since Jenna still has 5 sapphires after the trade, the value of these 5 sapphires remains unchanged at:
\[ \text{Value of remaining sapphires} = 5 \times \$\frac{800}{3} = \$\frac{4000}{3} \approx \$1333.33 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total value of the rubies.
Jenna received 2 rubies from the trade, so the value of these 2 rubies is:
\[ \text{Value of rubies} = 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

### Step 5: Sum up the values of all jewels.
Finally, add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies to get the total value of all her jewels:
\[ \text{Total Value} = \$1333.33 \text{(sapphires)} + \$800 \text{(rubies)} = \$2133.33 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2133.33} \]<|im_end|>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

1. **Determine how many apples each person eats per day:**
   - Marin and Nancy both eat 4 apples a day.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples eaten by each person over 30 days:**
   - For Marin:
     \[
     \text{Apples eaten by Marin} = 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - For Nancy:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much potting soil Bob will need and the total cost, let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed using its dimensions:

- Width = 2 feet
- Length = 8 feet
- Height = 2 feet

Volume of one raised bed = width × length × height
= 2 ft × 8 ft × 2 ft
= 32 cubic feet

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume needed for all raised beds.
Since Bob has 10 raised beds, we multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds:

Total volume needed = Volume of one raised bed × Number of raised beds
= 32 cubic feet/bed × 10 beds
= 320 cubic feet

### Step 3: Determine the number of bags required.
Each bag contains 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed to cover the total volume, divide the total volume by the volume per bag:

Number of bags required = Total volume needed / Volume per bag
= 320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag
= 160 bags

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12. Therefore, to find the total cost, multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

Total cost = Number of bags × Cost per bag
= 160 bags × $12/bag
= $1920

### Conclusion:
Bob will need 160 bags of potting soil to fill all 10 raised beds. The total cost for these bags will be **$1920**.<|im_end|>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.
He has 10 beds, so he will need 10 * 32 = <<10*32=320>>320 cubic feet of dirt.
Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

                    question:
                    ? In a : set of magicians cards, there are 15 , red cards, and ! 60% more green cards. Yellow cards : are as many, as ? the . sum of ! red : and green ; cards. How many cards of all : mentioned colors are there?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cards.
We know that there are 15 red cards in total.

Given that there are **!** 60% more green cards than red cards, we can calculate the number of green cards using the formula:

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + (\text{Number of red cards} \times 60\%) \]

Substitute the given value for red cards (15):

\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (15 \times 0.6) \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 24 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of yellow cards.
The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.

\[ \text{Total number of yellow cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} \]

Substitute the values we found:

\[ \text{Total number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total number of yellow cards} = 39 \]

### Step 3: Verify the consistency with the problem statement.
According to the problem, yellow cards should be as many as the sum of red and green cards. We have already calculated it, so let's check if it matches:

\[ \text{Sum of red and green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

This confirms our calculations.

### Final Answer:
The total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: Katelyn saw 50 fairies.

2. **Fairies Joining from East**:
   - One friend saw half as many fairies coming from the east.
   - Half of 50 fairies = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.

So after this point, the total number of fairies would be:
- Initial count: 50
- Fairies joining from east: 25
- Total at this stage: \( 50 + 25 = 75 \)

3. **Fairies Leaving**:
   - After ten minutes (half an hour), three more fairies left.

So we subtract these three fairies from the current total:
- Current total: 75
- Fairies leaving: 3
- Final total: \( 75 - 3 = 72 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 72.<|im_end|>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of puppies from both Jennifer and Brandon:**
   - Jennifer's dogs have 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dogs have 12 puppies.

   Total number of puppies = \( 8 + 12 \)

2. **Calculate the number of puppies that have spots for both Jennifer and Brandon:**
   - For Jennifer’s puppies: 
     \( 3! \) (which means there are 3 puppies)
     \( \text{spots} = 3 \times \frac{3}{7} \) (since \( \frac{3}{7} \) represents the proportion of puppies that have spots in her litter).

   - For Brandon's puppies:
     \( 4! \) (which means there are 4 puppies)
     \( \text{spots} = 4 \times \frac{5}{9} \) (since \( \frac{5}{9} \) represents the proportion of puppies that have spots in his litter).

3. **Add up the total number of puppies that have spots:**

   - For Jennifer:
     \( 3 \times \frac{3}{7} \)

   - For Brandon:
     \( 4 \times \frac{5}{9} \)

   Let's calculate these values:

   - For Jennifer:
     \( 3 \times \frac{3}{7} = \frac{9}{7} \approx 1.2857 \) (rounded to four decimal places)

   - For Brandon:
     \( 4 \times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{20}{9} \approx 2.2222 \) (rounded to four decimal places)

4. **Sum the total number of puppies that have spots:**
   
   \( \text{Total spots} = \frac{9}{7} + \frac{20}{9} \)

5. **Calculate the overall percentage of puppies that have spots:**

   The formula to find the percentage is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total spots}}{\text{Total puppies}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in our numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\frac{9}{7} + \frac{20}{9}}{20} \right) \times 100
   \]

6. **Simplify and compute the final result:**

   First, find the sum inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \frac{9}{7} + \frac{20}{9} = \frac{81}{63} + \frac{140}{63} = \frac{221}{63}
   \]

   Now divide by 20:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{221}{63}}{20} = \frac{221}{63 \times 20} = \frac{221}{1260}
   \]

   Finally, convert to a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{221}{1260} \right) \times 100 \approx 17.619\%

<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total weight of the feed needed
First, we need to calculate the total weight of the feed required.

- **Hay**: The farmer has 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
  \[
  42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Oats**: The farmer has 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
  \[
  20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Carrots**: Let's assume he needs \( x \) pounds of carrots in total. We'll find out later if this assumption is correct.
  \[
  \text{Total feed} = \text{Hay} + \text{Oats} + \text{Carrots}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total feed} = 3150 + 1300 + x = 4450 + x \text{ pounds}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of trips needed
Now, we need to determine how many times the farmer needs to load his truck (which can carry 2250 pounds at a time) to transport all the feed.

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total feed}}{\text{Capacity of truck}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{4450 + x}{2250}
\]

Since \( x \) represents the total amount of carrots needed, which is not specified yet, we cannot simplify further without knowing \( x \).

However, since \( x \) must be less than or equal to 4450 pounds to ensure there is enough carrot for the horses, the number of trips will be an integer value based on whether \( x \) falls within that range.

### Conclusion
Given the information provided, the number of trips needed to transport all the feed depends on the exact amount of carrots (\( x \)) needed. Without specifying the amount of carrots, we cannot provide a numerical answer to the trip count.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The number of trips needed depends on the exact amount of carrots needed.}}

The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans and plastic bottles over a four-week period.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings from aluminum cans**
- Each aluminum can is worth $0.02 (two cents).
- Grayson drinks three cans of soda per week.
- There are four weeks in a month.

First, let's find out how many cans she drinks in total:

\[ \text{Total cans} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings from these cans:

\[ \text{Earnings from cans} = 12 \times 0.02 = 0.24 \]

So, Grayson earns **$0.24** from recycling aluminum cans.

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from plastic bottles**
- Each plastic bottle is worth $0.03 (three cents).

Grayson drinks five plastic bottles of water per week.

First, let's find out how many bottles she drinks in total:

\[ \text{Total bottles} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Now, we calculate her earnings from these bottles:

\[ \text{Earnings from bottles} = 20 \times 0.03 = 0.60 \]

So, Grayson earns **$0.60** from recycling plastic bottles.

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings**
Finally, we add the earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles to get the total amount earned in a four-week period:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 0.24 + 0.60 = 0.84 \]

Therefore, Grayson earns **$0.84** from recycling cans and bottles in a four-week period.

This concludes our step-by-step calculation. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0.84}

To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants Frederick has.
Frederick has 10 plants.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants Toni has based on Frederick's count.
Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Number of plants Frederick has} + (0.60 \times \text{Number of plants Frederick has}) \]

Substitute the value for Frederick:
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + (0.60 \times 10) \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 16 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Shondra has based on Toni's count.
Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Number of plants Toni has} - 7 \]

Substitute the value for Toni:
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 9 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 9}}
\]<|im_end|>","Toni has 10 * 0.60 = <<10*0.60=6>>6 more plants than Frederick

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial amount in Ali's possession:**
   - Ali starts with $21.

2. **Leila gives Ali money:**
   - Leila gives Ali half of her $100.
   - Half of $100 is calculated as follows:

     \]
   - Therefore, Leila gives Ali $50.

3. **Adding the given money to Ali's initial amount:**
   - Add the $50 from Leila to Ali's original $21.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     21 + 50 = 71

\[ \text{Tip Amount} = \frac{1}{5} \times \$15 \]

**Step 2: Perform the multiplication**

\[ \text{Tip Amount} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Tip Amount} = 3 \]

So, Ashley should give a tip that equals 3 dollars.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of cards Miss Maria has:**
   - Each deck contains 25 basketball cards.
   - There are 6 decks, so she has \(6 \times 25 = 150\) basketball cards.

   - Each box contains 40 baseball cards.
   - There are 5 boxes, so she has \(5 \times 40 = 200\) baseball cards.

   - Therefore, the total number of cards (both types) is \(150 + 200 = 350\).

2. **Calculate the number of cards left after giving some to her students:**
   - Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.
   - The remaining cards that need to be given out are \(350 - 50 = 300\).

3. **Determine how many students can receive 10 cards each from these 300 cards:**
   - Since each student receives 10 cards, we divide the total number of remaining cards by 10.
   - This gives us \(300 \div 10 = 30\) students.

Therefore, Miss Maria has **30 students**. 

{The final answer is} 30.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Becky and Kelly paid after their respective discounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discount for Becky.
- Becky bought 20 apples at $0.45 each.
- Total cost before discount = Number of apples * Price per apple
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.45 = \$9.00 \]

### Step 2: Apply the discount for Becky.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Final amount Becky paid = Total cost - Discount
\[ \text{Final amount Becky paid} = 9.00 - 1.00 = \$8.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost before any discount for Kelly.
- Kelly bought 20 apples at $0.50 each.
- Total cost before discount = Number of apples * Price per apple
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.50 = \$10.00 \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount for Kelly.
- Kelly received a 10% discount on her purchase.
- Let \( D \) be the discount percentage.
- The formula for calculating the discount amount is: 
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \left(\frac{D}{100}\right) \times \text{Total Cost} \]
Since she gets a 10% discount, \( D = 10\% \).
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \left(\frac{10}{100}\right) \times 10 = \$1.00 \]
- Final amount Kelly paid = Total cost - Discount Amount
\[ \text{Final amount Kelly paid} = 10.00 - 1.00 = \$9.00 \]

### Step 5: Determine how much more Kelly paid compared to Becky.
- Difference in payment = Final amount Kelly paid - Final amount Becky paid
\[ \text{Difference} = 9.00 - 8.00 = \$1.00 \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

**The final answer is:**  
The final answer is: **$1.00**<|im_end|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

To determine the total number of pieces of laundry, we need to calculate the number of items required per room and then multiply that by the number of rooms.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of sheets:**
   - Each room has 2 sheets.
   - Total sheets = \(2 \times 80 = 160\).

2. **Calculate the number of comforters:**
   - Each room has 1 comforter.
   - Total comforters = \(1 \times 80 = 80\).

3. **Calculate the number of pillow cases:**
   - Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets.
     - Number of pillows = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) (since each sheet has 2).
     - Total pillow cases = \(4 \times 80 = 320\).

4. **Calculate the number of towel cases:**
   - Each room has twice as many towel cases as pillow cases.
     - Number of towels = \(2 \times 4 = 8\) (since each pillow case has 4).
     - Total towel cases = \(8 \times 80 = 640\).

5. **Sum up all the items needed per room:**
   - Sheets: 160
   - Comforters: 80
   - Pillow Cases: 320
   - Towel Cases: 640
   - Total pieces of laundry per room = \(160 + 80 + 320 + 640 = 1200\).

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 1200.<|im_end|>","First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases

   - Each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Total shoes from Monday = \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.

3. **Total shoes after Monday:**
   - Initial shoes + Shoes from Monday = \(200 + 10 = 210\) shoes.

4. **Shoes gained on Wednesday:**
   - He gains 15 new pairs.
   - Again, each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Total shoes from Wednesday = \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.

5. **Total shoes after Wednesday:**

6. **Shoes gained on Friday:**
   - He gains 30 more pairs.
   - Again, each pair consists of 2 shoes.
   - Total shoes from Friday = \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

7. **Total shoes after Friday:**

8. **Shoes removed on Saturday:**
   - He removes 180 shoes.

9. **Final total shoes:**

To determine how many pans worth of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with the sprinkles.
- Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles.
- Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes.

\[ \text{Total cupcakes} = \text{Number of jars} \times \text{Cupcakes per jar} \]

\[ \text{Total cupcakes} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

So far, we have calculated that Mary can decorate 48 cupcakes with her sprinkles.

### Step 2: Determine how many pans are needed to hold the cupcakes.
- Each pan holds 12 cupcakes.

\[ \text{Number of pans} = \frac{\text{Total cupcakes}}{\text{Cupcakes per pan}} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from what Theo gave the cashier
- Theo gave the cashier $10.
- Subtract the total cost ($7) from what she gave:
  \[
  \$10 - \$7 = \$3

4. Determine how many pencils were used at the end of the year.
5. Finally, calculate how many pencils were left.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Initial Number of Pencils
There are 30 students in Marissa's class, and each student starts with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils initially is:
\[ \text{Total pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

### Step 2: Pencils Used After Two Months
After two months, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used. So, the number of pencils used after two months is:
\[ \text{Pencils used after two months} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

### Step 3: Remaining Pencils After Two Months
Subtracting the used pencils from the initial amount gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining pencils after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240 \]

### Step 4: Pencils Left at the End of the Year
At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left. So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[ \text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]<|im_end|>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.
After two months, 300 x 1/5 = <<300*1/5=60>>60 pencils were used.
Thus, 300 - 60 = <<300-60=240>>240 pencils were left unused after two months.
Therefore, 240 x 1/3 = <<240*1/3=80>>80 pencils were left at the end of the year.

                    question:
                    Matt wants cookies . for ; a snack, ; but ! his dad wants him ; to . eat healthily. He tells Matt he can , have ; half as many cookies as the number of carrot . sticks : he ? eats, plus two extra , for cleaning : his room.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies Matt needs:**
   - Matt wants to eat 5 cookies.

2. **Understand the relationship between cookies and carrot sticks:**
   - The number of carrot sticks Matt eats should be twice the number of cookies he has.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.

3. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - According to the problem, the number of carrot sticks equals twice the number of cookies.
     \[
     C = 2 \times \text{number of cookies}
     \]

4. **Express the number of cookies in terms of \( C \):**
   - Since \( C \) represents the number of carrot sticks, we can write:
     \[
     \text{number of cookies} = \frac{C}{2}
     \]

5. **Substitute the known value (5 cookies) into the equation:**
   - We know that Matt needs to eat 5 cookies, so substitute \( C = 5 \):
     \[
     \text{number of cookies} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of carrot sticks Matt needs:**
   - Substitute back into the equation for carrot sticks:
     \[
     C = 2 \times 2.5 = 5
     \]

Therefore, Matt needs to eat 5 carrot sticks to meet his goal of eating 5 cookies.

**Final Answer:** Matt has to eat 5 carrot sticks.<|im_end|>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3

                    question:
                    Benny saw ; a 10-foot ? shark with 2 ? 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of ? the shark's body length , is the ! combined length of the ! remoras?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of the shark's total length is occupied by the combined length of its two remoras.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**:
   - The shark's total length is given in feet.
   - The remoras' lengths are given in inches.

   Let's convert the remora lengths from inches to feet for consistency.

   - Remora 1: \( 2 \text{ inches} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet} \)
     \[
     \frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet}
     \]

   - Remora 2: \( 6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} \text{ feet} \)
     \[
     \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Sum the lengths of the remoras**:
   - Combined length of both remoras:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{3}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark’s body length that these remoras occupy**:
   - Shark's total length: \( 10 \text{ feet} \)

   To find the percentage:
   \[
   \left( \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{10} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   \left( \frac{2}{3} \div 10 \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{30} \right) \times 100\% = \frac{2}{30} \times 100\%
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   \frac{2}{30} = \frac{1}{15}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \frac{1}{15} \times 100\% = \frac{100}{15}\%
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{6.67\%}\).<|im_end|>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches
Then divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot
Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the grade level based on the given information.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Three-fourths of students have a desktop computer.
   - There are 20 students who do not have a desktop computer.
   - We need to find the total number of students.

2. **Setting up the Equation:**
   Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \).

3. **Expressing the Given Information Mathematically:**
   - Since three-fourths of students have a desktop computer, one-fourth of students do not have a desktop computer.
   - Therefore, the number of students without a desktop computer is \( \frac{1}{4}x \).
   - According to the problem, this number is 20 students.

4. **Formulating the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}x = 20
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = 20 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 80

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Jason needs to walk per day to break in his new shoes within the given time frame.

1. **Determine total time needed to break in the shoes:**
   - According to the problem, it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.
   
2. **Calculate total number of days Jason will be able to break in the shoes:**
   - Jason plans to use the shoes over three weeks.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, three weeks equal \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

3. **Calculate the number of days Jason will be able to break in the shoes each week:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, and Jason uses the shoes for 4 days each week, he will be able to break in the shoes for \(4\) days each week.

4. **Calculate the number of weeks Jason will be able to break in the shoes:**
   - Jason will be able to break in the shoes for 21 days.
   - Since he breaks in the shoes every 4 days, the number of weeks he can break in the shoes is \(21 / 4\).
   - Simplifying, \(21 / 4 = 5.25\) weeks (rounded down since partial weeks don't count).

5. **Calculate the number of days Jason has to walk per week:**
   - Since he breaks in the shoes every 4 days, he must walk \(4\) days per week.

6. **Calculate the total number of minutes Jason needs to walk per day:**
   - To find out how much time Jason needs to walk per day, divide the total minutes needed to break in the shoes by the number of days per week.
   - Total minutes per day = \(240 \div 4 = 60\) minutes per day.

Therefore, Jason needs to spend **60 minutes** on the walk each day to break in his new shoes within the three-week period.<|im_end|>","First find how many days Jason has to prepare for the tryouts: 3 weeks * 4 days/week = <<3*4=12>>12 days

   - Number of kids allergic to dairy (A) = 9
   - Number of kids allergic to peanuts (B) = 6
   - Number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts (A ∩ B) = 3

2. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for two sets:**
   The formula for the union of two sets A and B is:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   Here, \(|A|\) represents the number of kids allergic to dairy, \(|B|\) represents the number of kids allergic to peanuts, and \(|A \cap B|\) represents the number of kids allergic to both.

<|im_start|>user
To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to calculate the costs of both the plane tickets and the hotel stay.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Plane Tickets:
- Each plane ticket costs $5000.
- They are going on a 3-day trip.

**Total cost of plane tickets:**
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$5000 = \$15000 \]

#### Hotel Stay:
- The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price during weekends.
- The normal price per day at the hotel is $1500.

**Calculate the increased cost due to the weekend factor:**
\[ \text{Increased cost} = 20\% \times \$1500 = 0.20 \times \$1500 = \$300 \]

**Hotel cost for one day:**
\[ \text{Normal cost per day} = \$1500 \]
\[ \text{Cost increase per day} = \$300 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per day at hotel} = \$1500 + \$300 = \$1800 \]

**Total cost for 3 days at the hotel:**
\[ \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400 \]

#### Total Trip Cost:
- Add the cost of the plane tickets to the cost of the hotel stay.
\[ \text{Total trip cost} = \$15000 + \$5400 = \$20400 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: 
\[ \boxed{\$20400} \]<|im_end|>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Understand the relationship between weights**
- We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters as heavy as the 1959 penny.
- Let's denote the weight of the 1959 penny as \( W_{1959} \).
- Given \( W_{1959} = 48 \) grains.

**Step 2: Determine the weight of the 2010 penny**
- Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters as heavy as the 1959 penny,
\[ W_{2010} = \frac{3}{4} \times W_{1959} \]
Substitute \( W_{1959} \):
\[ W_{2010} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny**
\[ W_{2010} = 36 \] grains (since \( \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \))

**Step 4: Combine the weights of both pennies**
- Now we add the weights of the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny to get the total combined weight.
\[ Total\ Weight = W_{2010} + W_{1959} \]
Substitute the values:
\[ Total\ Weight = 36 + 48 \]

**Step 5: Perform the addition**
\[ Total\ Weight = 84 \] grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is **84 grains**.<|im_end|>","If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains
The combined weight for the two is 36 grains + 48 grains = <<36+48=84>>84 grains

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money Keegan and Tasha need to earn in order to reach their goal of $200.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total amount needed:**
   - The total amount needed is $200.

2. **Calculate how much money has already been earned:**
   - Keegan has earned $83.
   - Tasha has earned $91.

3. **Sum the amounts earned so far:**
   \[
   83 + 91 = 174
   \]

4. **Subtract the amount earned from the total needed:**
   \[
   200 - 174 = 26
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To reach their goal, Keegan and Tasha still need to earn an additional $26.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\boxed{26}<|im_end|>","They have raised $174 because 83 plus 91 equals <<83+91=174>>174.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many songs Luri has.
Gabriel has 20 songs in his portable media player.

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more songs Gabriel can add compared to Luri.
Gabriel's media player can hold up to 100 songs. Since he already has 20 songs, he can still add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
songs.

Luri has only 60 songs, so he cannot add any more songs to his media player.

### Step 3: Determine how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel.
Since Luri currently has 60 songs and cannot add any more, we need to compare what he can do versus what he actually does (which is none).

Gabriel can add 80 songs, whereas Luri cannot add any at all.

Therefore, Luri can add fewer songs than Gabriel because he is at capacity.

### Final Answer:
Luri can add fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is that Luri can add fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.}}
\]<|im_end|>","Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many oranges Stetson ate:**
   - The total number of oranges picked is 60.
   - Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges.

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2 \times 60}{5}
\]

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{120}{5}

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = 24

To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate three times the cost of her shoes:**
   - The cost of Jillian's shoes is given as $80.
   - Three times this amount would be \( 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \).

2. **Subtract the cost of her handbag from three times the shoe cost:**
   - We know that Jillian's handbag costs $20 less than what three times the shoe cost.
   - Subtracting $20 from $240 gives us \( \$240 - \$20 = \$220 \).

Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $\boxed{220}$.<|im_end|>","First triple the cost of the shoes: $80 * 3 = $<<80*3=240>>240

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of miles James runs in a week:**
   - James runs 12 miles per day.
   - He runs for 5 days a week.

\[
\text{Total miles} = \text{Miles per day} \times \text{Days per week}
\]

\[
\text{Total miles} = 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

2. **Determine the time it takes James to run those miles at his running speed:**
   - We know that James runs 10 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

\[
\text{Time (hours)} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

So, James runs for 6 hours each week.

3. **Verify the calculation:**

- Total distance: \( 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \)
- Time taken: \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours/week} \)

Both calculations confirm that James runs for 6 hours each week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs for five days, we'll break this down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats needed per day.
Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and there are two meals per day. Therefore, each horse's daily consumption is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/horse} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Since Uncle Ben has four horses, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 4 \text{ horses} \times 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days.
For five days, the total amount of oats needed is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many bags of oats are required.
One bag contains 50 pounds of oats. To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total amount of oats needed by the number of pounds in one bag:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

### Conclusion:
Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 4}}
\]<|im_end|>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.

   - We know that two-thirds of Jana's total puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Jana has 27 puppies in total.

   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
   \]

   Let's calculate this:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies.

2. **Determine the number of Pomeranian puppies that are girls:**
   - We're told that one-third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls.

   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranian puppies that are girls} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total capacity of the trays:**
   - Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
   - Jaime has 2 trays.

2. **Calculate the total capacity for all trays combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of eggs Jaime actually has from the total capacity:**
   - Jaime has 64 eggs.
   - The total capacity is 48 eggs.
   \[
   \text{Eggs that will fit} = 48 \text{ (total capacity)} - 64 \text{ (actual eggs)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Eggs that will fit} = 48 - 64 = -16

                    Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a , pack.  They are ! currently , on sale for , buy ? one get ! one free. .  ! She also has a $2.00 ? coupon.  How much will each individual : razor cost, in . cents, after the discount if she , buys , 2 ; packs , of razors?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much each individual razor costs after the discount, let's break this down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather buys 2 packs.
   - Total number of razors = \( 4 \text{ razors/pack} \times 2 \text{ packs} = 8 \text{ razors} \).

2. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Total cost before discount = \( 2 \text{ packs} \times \$4.00/\text{pack} = \$8.00 \).

3. **Apply the ""buy 2, get 1 free"" promotion:**
   - With every purchase of 2 razors, she gets an additional 1 razor for free.
   - For 2 packs (which gives her 6 razors), she only pays for 2 razors but receives 4 razors.
   - Cost per pack under promotion = \( \frac{\$4.00}{6} = \frac{\$4.00}{6} = \$\frac{2}{3} \approx \$0.67 \) per razor.

4. **Account for the coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon that can be applied to the total cost.
   - After applying the coupon, the total cost becomes \( \$8.00 - \$2.00 = \$6.00 \).

5. **Calculate the average cost per razor after all discounts:**
   - Since she bought 6 razors at a discounted rate,
   - Average cost per razor = \( \frac{\$6.00}{6} = \$1.00 \).

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after all discounts and considering the promotional offer and the coupon is approximately $1.00.<|im_end|>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the tallest cheerleader in the pyramid. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cheerleaders in the pyramid.
- There are 4 girls on the bottom level.
- There are 3 girls standing on top of the 4 girls.
- There are 2 girls standing on top of the 3 girls.
- The shortest girl (the one at the very top) has not been determined yet.

Let's denote the total number of cheerleaders as \( n \).

Given that there are 4 girls on the bottom and 3 girls on the top, the total number of cheerleaders can be represented as:

\[ n = 4 + 3 + 2 \]

Calculating this sum:

\[ n = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 \]

So, there are **9** cheerleaders in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the average height of the cheerleaders.
We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall. Therefore, the remaining cheerleader must also be 64 inches tall because the total number of cheerleaders is 9.

Thus, the average height of all cheerleaders is 64 inches.

### Step 3: Determine the position of the shortest cheerleader.
Since the total number of cheerleaders is 9, the shortest cheerleader will be the one who is the 5th from the top when counting starting from the bottom.

### Step 4: Calculate the height of the pyramid.
Now, let’s calculate the total height of the pyramid by multiplying the average height by the number of cheerleaders:

\[ \text{Total Height} = 64 \times 9 \]

Performing the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total Height} = 576 \text{ inches} \]

Convert the total height from inches to feet:

\[ \frac{576}{12} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the total height of the pyramid is **48 feet**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]<|im_end|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

To determine how many minutes Charisma walks after working for 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Charisma works in 5 days.
2. Determine the total number of walking intervals (each lasting 5 minutes) that occur during her work time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours worked in 5 days.
- Charisma works 8 hours per day.
- Over 5 days, she will work \( 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours} \).

Step 2: Determine the total number of walking intervals.
- Each hour she works, she takes a 5-minute break.
- Therefore, over 40 hours, she will have \( 40 \text{ hours} \div 1 \text{ interval/hour} = 40 \text{ intervals} \).

Step 3: Calculate the total walking time.
- Each interval lasts 5 minutes.
- So, the total walking time is \( 40 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ minutes/interval} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, after 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked for a total of 200 minutes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine Angela's current age based on the information given about Brett and their relationship.

Step 1: Determine how many years it will be when Angela is three times as old as Brett.
Since it is mentioned that in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett, we can set up an equation for their ages at that time.

Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age. In four years, Angela will be \( A + 4 \) years old, and Brett will be \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) years old.

According to the problem, at that point, Angela will be three times as old as Brett:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times (18) \]

Step 2: Solve the equation to find Angela's current age.
First, simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 54 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate \( A \):
\[ A = 54 - 4 \]
\[ A = 50 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 50 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Paul spent on driving his car over the two-week period, let's break this down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Spending

First, we need to find out how many rides Paul makes per day.

- **Morning Rides**: According to the problem, Paul drives in the morning for 14 days.
- **Afternoon Rides**: The problem states that Paul also drives in the afternoon for 14 days.

So, total number of rides per day = Morning rides + Afternoon rides
= 14 (morning) + 14 (afternoon)
= 28 rides per day

Now, calculate daily spending:

- **Cost per morning ride** = $6
- **Total daily cost** = Cost per morning ride × Number of morning rides per day
= $6 × 14
= $84

Next, calculate daily afternoons cost:

- **Cost per afternoon ride** = $2
- **Total daily cost** = Cost per afternoon ride × Number of afternoon rides per day
= $2 × 14
= $28

Finally, add both costs together to get the total daily spending:

- **Total daily spending** = Total morning cost + Total afternoon cost
= $84 + $28
= $112

### Step 2: Calculate Weekly Spending

Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the daily spending by 7 to find out weekly spending:

- **Weekly spending** = Total daily spending × Number of days in a week
= $112 × 7
= $784

### Final Answer

Therefore, the amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \boxed{784}.<|im_end|>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.
Driving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.
So in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges brought by Ashley:**
   - Ashley brought 5 boxes.
   - Each box contains 10 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges Ashley brought is \(5 \times 10 = 50\).

2. **Determine the number of oranges brought by Brianne:**
   - Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley.
   - Since Ashley brought 50 oranges, Brianne brought \(50 + 20 = 70\) oranges.

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges available:**
   - The total number of oranges is the sum of what Ashley and Brianne brought together.
   - So, the total number of oranges is \(50 + 70 = 120\).

4. **Determine how many Greek orange pies can be made:**
   - One Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges.
   - To find out how many pies can be made, divide the total number of oranges by the number needed per pie.
   - This gives us \(120 \div 3 = 40\) pies.

Therefore, they can make 40 Greek orange pies. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The final answer is 40.<|im_end|>","Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many guests are necessary for both venues to have the same cost, we need to set up equations based on the given information and solve them.

Let's denote:
- \( n \) as the number of guests attending.
- \( c \) as the total cost.

### First Venue
1. **Flat Fee**: $200
2. **Per Person Charge**: $25 (per guest)
3. **Cost without Food**: $5 per guest

Since the first venue includes food at no additional charge, we only consider the flat fee:

\[ \text{Total Cost}_1 = \$200 + (\$25 \times n) \]

### Second Venue
1. **Flat Fee**: Not applicable since it doesn't include food
2. **Per Person Charge**: $25 (per guest)

For the second venue, the cost depends solely on the number of guests and their individual contribution:

\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = \$25n \]

### Setting Up Equations
We want the total costs from both venues to be equal:

\[ \text{Total Cost}_1 = \text{Total Cost}_2 \]
\[ \$200 + \$25n = \$25n \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ \$200 = \$25n - \$25n \]
\[ \$200 = \$0 \]

This simplifies to an incorrect statement because it results in zero. Let's correct our approach by correctly setting up the equation considering both costs separately but equating them when food costs are factored into the second venue's calculation.

### Correct Approach
First, let’s re-evaluate the cost structure accurately:

1. **First Venue**:
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Per guest charge: $25
   - Total cost before including food: 
     \[ C_1 = \$200 + \$25n \]

2. **Second Venue**:
   - Flat fee: Not applicable here (as it excludes food)
   - Per guest charge: $25
   - Food cost per guest: $5
   - Total cost after including food:
     \[ C_2 = \$25n + (\$5 \times n) \]
   
Now, equate the two costs:

\[ \$200 + \$25n = \$25n + \$5n \]

Simplify the right side:

\[ \$200 + \$25n = \$30n \]

Subtract \( \$25n \) from both sides:

\[ \$200 = \$5n \]

Divide both sides by \$5:

\[ n = \frac{\$200}{\$5} \]
\[ n = 40 \]

Thus, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is **40**.<|im_end|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( L \) represent the number of insects that Lily found.
   Let \( D \) represent the number of insects that David found.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of insects that Bodhi found.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that together they collected 43 insects: 
     \[
     L + D + B = 43
     \]
   - Lily found 7 more than David:
     \[
     L = D + 7
     \]
   - David found half of what Bodhi found:
     \[
     D = \frac{B}{2}
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve for One Variable:**
   Substitute \( L \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + B = 43
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2D + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2D + B = 36
   \]

4. **Express \( D \) in Terms of \( B \):**
   From the third equation:
   \[
   D = \frac{B}{2}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( D \) back into the Equation:**
   Substitute \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) into \( 2D + B = 36 \):
   \[
   2\left(\frac{B}{2}\right) + B = 36
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   B + B = 36
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   2B = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   B = 18
   \]

6. **Find \( D \) and \( L \):**
   Using \( D = \frac{B}{2} \):
   \[
   D = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   Now, using \( L = D + 7 \):
   \[
   L = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

7. **Verify the Total:**
   Check if the total matches 43:
   \[
   L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
   \]
   The total is correct.

8. **Final Answer:**
   Lily found 16 insects.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much yarn Mariah's grandmother used together with her.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the amount of yarn used by Mariah:**
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein.
   - There are 364 yards in one skein.
   - Therefore, the length of yarn Mariah used can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of yarn used by Mariah} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 364 \text{ yards}
     \]
     Simplifying this,
     \[
     \text{Length of yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandmother:**
   - Mariah's grandmother used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.
   - Again, there are 364 yards in one skein.
   - Therefore, the length of yarn used by Mariah's grandmother can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of yarn used by grandmother} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 364 \text{ yards}
     \]
     Simplifying this,
     \[
     \text{Length of yarn used by grandmother} = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandmother:**
   - The total length of yarn used is the sum of the lengths used by Mariah and her grandmother.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Total length of yarn used} = 91 \text{ yards (Mariah)} + 182 \text{ yards (grandmother)}
     \]
     Adding these values,
     \[
     \text{Total length of yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Together, Mariah and her grandmother used 273 yards of yarn.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of gifts needed for each friend group.

- **Cherrie's first group (friends who want 5 gifts)**:
    - Number of friends in this group = 2
    - Each friend wants 5 gifts.
    - Total gifts needed from these friends = \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

- **Cherrie's second group (friends who want 2 gifts)**:
    - Number of friends in this group = 3
    - Each friend wants 2 gifts.
    - Total gifts needed from these friends = \(3 \times 2 = 6\)

### Step 2: Add up the total number of gifts needed.

Total gifts needed = Gifts from first group + Gifts from second group
\[= 10 + 6 = 16\]

### Step 3: Determine how many gifts Cherrie buys initially.

Cherrie buys enough gifts so that she can give out the calculated amount plus an extra 10 gifts as surprises.

Since she already knows the exact numbers for both groups:
- Gifts bought initially = 16

### Step 4: Add the additional 10 gifts as surprises.

Additional gifts bought = 10

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of gifts bought.

Total gifts bought = Initial gifts + Additional gifts
\[= 16 + 10 = 26\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26.<|im_end|>","Two of Cherries friends in total want 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 gifts.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The rug is \(5\)! feet wider than the chair.
   - The couch is \(2\) feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - The chair is \(3\) feet wide.

2. **Determine the width of the rug:**
   - Let \(W_c\) be the width of the chair.
   - Given that \(W_c = 3\) feet.
   - According to the first statement, the rug is \(5\)! times wider than the chair.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug (\(W_r\)) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     W_r = 5! \times W_c
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     W_r = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the length of the couch:**
   - According to the second statement, the couch is \(2\) feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - First, calculate twice the width of the rug:
     \[
     2 \times W_r = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Then add \(2\) feet to get the length of the couch:
     \[
     L_couch = 30 + 2 = 32 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The length of the couch is \(32\) feet.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( x \) be the price of one pack of strawberry gum.
- We know that Suzie spent a total of $7 on all the packs of gum.

### Step 2: Determine the Cost of Each Type of Gummy Bear
- The price of two packs of strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
- The price of one pack of grape gum is \( x \).
- The price of one pack of green apple gum is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

### Step 3: Set Up an Equation
Suzie bought three different types of gummy bears (two flavors of strawberry, one flavor of grape, and one flavor of green apple). She spent a total of $7.

\[ 2x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 7 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
First, we need to combine like terms:

\[ 2x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 3x + \frac{x}{2} \]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator (which is 2):

\[ \frac{6x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6x + x}{2} = \frac{7x}{2} \]

So our equation becomes:

\[ \frac{7x}{2} = 7 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[ 7x = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum costs $2.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$2}
\]<|im_end|>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget and materials, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sticks Frederick can make from the cheaper wood (the 2 x 4 piece)**
   - Cost of 2 x 4 piece: $4
   - Number of sticks per piece: 200 sticks
   - Total cost for this material: $4 (no additional cost mentioned)
   - Number of sticks Frederick can make: 200 sticks

2. **Calculate the number of sticks Frederick can make from the more expensive wood (the 2 x 8 piece)**
   - Cost of 2 x 8 piece: $6
   - Number of sticks per piece: 400 sticks
   - Total cost for this material: $6 (no additional cost mentioned)
   - Number of sticks Frederick can make: 400 sticks

3. **Determine the total number of sticks Frederick can make from both types of wood combined**
   - From 2 x 4 piece: 200 sticks
   - From 2 x 8 piece: 400 sticks
   - Combined total: 200 + 400 = 600 sticks

4. **Compare the total number of sticks made using different combinations of materials against Frederick’s budget**
   - Budget available: $24
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 piece: $4
   - Remaining budget after buying 2 x 4 pieces: $24 - $4 = $20
   - Using remaining budget on 2 x 8 piece: $20 / $6 = 3.33 pieces
   - Since Frederick cannot buy partial pieces, he can only use whole pieces.
   - Therefore, he can buy 3 full 2 x 8 pieces.

5. **Calculate the total number of sticks Frederick can now make with the remaining budget and the new amount of sticks he can purchase**
   - Cost for 3 x 2 x 8 pieces: $6 * 3 = $18
   - Remaining budget after buying 3 x 2 x 8 pieces: $20 - $18 = $2
   - Number of sticks from remaining budget: $2 / $4 = 1 stick
   - Total number of sticks Frederick can make: 400 (from 2 x 8 pieces) + 1 (remaining budget) = 401 sticks

**Conclusion:** Frederick can make a maximum of 401 popsicle sticks with the given budget and materials.

Mario needs to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs. Assuming his dogs each have four legs and each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, how much will it cost him to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs?

Step 1: Determine the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since Mario has 6 sled dogs and each dog has 4 legs, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes he requires.

Number of legs per dog = 4
Total number of legs for 6 dogs = 4 * 6 = 24 legs

Since each pair of snowshoes covers two legs (one for each dog), we divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs:

Pairs of snowshoes required = Total number of legs / Legs per pair
                            = 24 / 2
                            = 12 pairs

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, so we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair to get the total cost.

Total cost = Number of pairs * Cost per pair
           = 12 * $12.00
           = $144.00

Therefore, the total amount Mario will spend on buying snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00.<|im_end|>","Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost without using a bus pass:**
   - Janet takes 2 buses per day.
   - She does this every day of the week (5 days).
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.

   First, calculate the number of bus trips in one week:
   \[
   2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week}
   \]

   Next, calculate the total cost without a pass:
   \[
   10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00
   \]

2. **Compare the total cost to the cost of a weekly pass:**
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.

3. **Determine the savings:**
   - Subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost without a pass:
   \[
   \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00
   \]

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass instead of taking individual bus trips.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

   - Rose bought 4 potatoes.
   - Rose bought 4 times the number of onions that Sophia bought.

2. **Determine the number of onions Sophia bought:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of onions Sophia bought.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between today (December 31st) and Andy's birthday (July 19th)**

- From December 31st to January 1st = 1 day
- From January 2nd to February 28th = 26 days (assuming no leap year)
- From March 1st to April 30th = 37 days (April has 30 days in non-leap years)
- From May 1st to June 1st = 6 days (June has 30 days in non-leap years)
- From June 2nd to July 19th = 17 days

Total days from December 31st to July 19th = 1 + 26 + 37 + 37 + 6 + 17 = **114 days**

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds**

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds. Each pound requires approximately 3500 calories to be lost.

Calories needed to lose 30 pounds = 30 * 3500 = **105,000 calories**

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories Andy consumes over the course of losing 30 pounds**

Since we don't have information about Andy's daily caloric intake, we can only calculate the required calorie deficit for the remaining days after his birthday.

Remaining days after July 19th = 114 - 1 = **113 days**

**Step 4: Calculate the average daily caloric deficit needed to reach the goal**

Total calories to be burnt = 105,000 calories
Number of days left to achieve the goal = 113 days

Average daily caloric deficit = Total calories to be burnt / Number of days left
= 105,000 / 113 ≈ **934.48 calories per day**

Therefore, Andy needs an average of **934.48 calories** burned each day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

{The final answer is} The final answer is **934.48 calories per day**.<|im_end|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah runs:**
   - Each lap is 0.25 kilometers.
   - She runs 8 laps.

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance per Lap} \times \text{Number of Laps}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 0.25 \text{ km/lap} \times 8 \text{ laps}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 2 \text{ km}
\]

2. **Convert the total distance from kilometers to milliliters (since 1 km = 1000 m and 1 m = 1000 mm):**

\[
1 \text{ km} = 1000 \text{ m}
\]

\[
1 \text{ m} = 1000 \text{ mm}
\]

\[
1 \text{ km} = 1000 \times 1000 \text{ mm} = 1,000,000 \text{ mm}
\]

3. **Determine how much water Hannah needs based on the given rate:**
   - Hannah needs 60 ml of water per kilometer.

Since she runs 2 kilometers:

\[
\text{Water Needed} = \text{Water per Kilometer} \times \text{Total Distance in Kilometers}
\]

\[
\text{Water Needed} = 60 \text{ ml/km} \times 2 \text{ km}
\]

\[
\text{Water Needed} = 120 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink **120 ml** of water.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Julie starts with $500.

2. **Spending on Clothes**:
   - Julie spends 20% of her initial amount on clothes.
   - Calculate 20% of $500: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 500 = 100
     \]
   - Subtract the cost from her initial amount:
     \[
     500 - 100 = 400
     \]

3. **Spending on CDs**:
   - After buying clothes, she has $400 left.
   - She then spends 25% of the remaining amount on CDs.
   - Calculate 25% of the remaining $400:
     \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the costs of both the house and the lot given that the total cost of the house and lot together is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define:
- \( L \) = amount of money the lot costs.
- \( H \) = amount of money the house costs.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We know from the problem statement that:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Additionally, it is stated that:
\[ H = 3L \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve for Lot Cost
Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Now, solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the lot costs $30,000.

### Step 4: Find House Cost
Since \( H = 3L \), substitute \( L = 30,000 \) back into this equation:
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Thus, the house costs $90,000.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The house costs $90,000.<|im_end|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost, total revenue, and then determine the profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of canvas bags:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs.
   - Each pack contains 5 canvas bags.
   \[
   \text{Total number of canvas bags} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of buying the canvas bags:**
   - Each bag costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 40 \times 4 = \$160
   \]

3. **Determine how many bags were sold:**
   - Tara painted all 40 bags.
   - She sold them at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Number of bags sold} = 40
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:**
   - Each bag was sold for $8.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 40 \times 8 = \$320
   \]

5. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 320 - 160 = \$160

To determine how many punches Joe throws in total during the fight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of minutes in one round.
2. Determine the total number of minutes for all rounds combined.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by the average number of punches per minute.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of minutes in one round**
- Each round is 3 minutes long.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of minutes for all rounds combined**
- There are 5 rounds in the fight.
- So, the total number of minutes = \( 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} \).

\[
\text{Total minutes} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ minutes}

   - Ali has four $10 bills: \(4 \times \$10 = \$40\).
   - He also has six $20 bills: \(6 \times \$20 = \$120\).

   Adding these together, the total amount of money Ali has before saving any money is:
   \[
   \$40 + \$120 = \$160

2. **Determine how much Ali saves after working for Mr. James:**
   - After working for Mr. James, Ali saves half of his total money. So, he saves:
     \[

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of items needed.
- There are three grandchildren (triplets).
- Each grandchild needs one hat, one scarf, one sweater, two pairs of mittens, and two pairs of socks.

So, in total, we have:
- 3 hats
- 3 scarves
- 3 sweaters
- 6 pairs of mittens (since there are 3 grandchildren)
- 6 pairs of socks (since there are 3 grandchildren)

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of wool required for each item.
- Hat: 2 skeins per hat
- Scarf: 4 skeins per scarf
- Sweater: 12 skeins per sweater
- Mitten: 1 skein per pair of mittens (so 2 pairs = 2 * 1 = 2 skeins)
- Sock: 2 skeins per pair of socks (so 2 pairs = 2 * 2 = 4 skeins)

Now let's sum these up:
- Hats: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins
- Scarfs: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins
- Sweaters: \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins
- Mittens: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) skeins
- Socks: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) skeins

### Step 3: Add up all the required amounts.
Total wool needed = \(6 + 12 + 36 + 12 + 24 = 90\) skeins

Therefore, Martha will need to buy **90** skeins of wool to knit everything for her grandchildren.<|im_end|>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each person can pick strawberries and then sum these rates.

1. **Determine Tony's rate**:
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

2. **Determine Bobby's rate**:
   - Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.
     \[
     \text{Bobby's rate} = \text{Tony's rate} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Determine Kathy's rate**:
   - Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
     \[
     \text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times \text{Bobby's rate} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

4. **Determine Ricky's rate**:
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.
     \[
     \text{Ricky's rate} = \text{Kathy's rate} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of quarts picked by all four people together:

\[
\text{Total rate} = \text{Tony's rate} + \text{Bobby's rate} + \text{Kathy's rate} + \text{Ricky's rate}
\]
\[
\text{Total rate} = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm is:

\[
\boxed{29}
\]<|im_end|>","Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.
Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, for a total of 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 quarts per hour.
Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, or a total of 10-2=8 quarts per hour. Thus, in total, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick 6+5+10+8=<<6+5+10+8=29>>29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

   \[
   \text{Total loaves baked} = 200
   \]

2. **Subtract the loaves sold in the morning:**
   \[
   \text{Loaves remaining after morning sales} = 200 - 93 = 107
   \]

3. **Subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon:**
   \[

   \]

4. **Account for the returns from the grocery store:**
   \[
   \text{Final number of loaves left} = 68 + 6 = 74

To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rows for the red tulips:**
   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.
   - Each row can hold 6 red tulips.

\[
\text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total red tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

2. **Calculate the number of rows for the blue tulips:**
   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
   - Each row can hold 8 blue tulips.

\[
\text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total blue tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

3. **Determine the total number of rows:**
   - Since the number of rows for both types of tulips must be the same (as they share the same number of tulips per row), Jackson will use one set of rows for all tulips.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jackson will plant 6 rows of flowers.<|im_end|>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

                    question:
                    ; Heather bought , a , jumbo ; bag of raisins with 27 , cups of raisins in it. She . wants to , make : oatmeal . cookies, ! granola, and snack mix with the ? raisins. , A batch of oatmeal ; cookies takes 3/4 ? of a cup of raisins. How many batches of oatmeal cookies can Heather make if ! she . divides the bag ! of raisins equally among the cookies, : granola, and snack mix?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate total raisins per batch:**
   - Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.

2. **Determine how many batches can be made from the raisins in the bag:**
   - The bag contains 27 cups of raisins.
   - Number of batches = Total raisins ÷ Raisins per batch
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup/batch}}
     \]
   
3. **Simplify the division:**
   - Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
   - Multiply numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{4} \):
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3}
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculate the multiplication:
     \[
     27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 36
     \]

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies from the raisins in her bag.

5. **Divide the number of batches between granola and snack mix:**
   - Since she wants to make three types of products (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), we need to divide the 36 batches evenly among these three products.

6. **Calculate the number of batches for each product:**
   - Number of batches per type = Total batches ÷ Number of types
     \[
     \text{Batches per type} = \frac{36 \text{ batches}}{3 \text{ types}}
     \]
   
7. **Simplify the division:**
   - Divide 36 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Batches per type} = 12
     \]

Therefore, Heather will use 12 batches for each of granola and snack mix.

8. **Check the remaining batches after dividing among granola and snack mix:**
   - Subtract the number of batches used for granola and snack mix from the total batches:
     \[
     \text{Remaining batches} = 36 \text{ batches} - (12 \text{ batches/granola} + 12 \text{ batches/snack mix})
     \]
     
9. **Perform the subtraction:**
   - Subtract 24 from 36:
     \[
     \text{Remaining batches} = 12 \text{ batches}
     \]

Thus, Heather has 12 batches left over that she can either save or repurpose as needed.

**Final Answer:** Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies, but she will have 12 additional batches left over that she can use for granola or snack mix.<|im_end|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's current electricity usage in a week.
Ada consumes 12 kilowatts (kW) per hour.

- **Daily Electricity Consumption**: 
  \[
  12 \text{ kW/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 288 \text{ kWh/week}
  \]

- **Weekly Electricity Usage**:
  \[
  288 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$432
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the power of the new device.
The new device will consume 2 kW per hour.

- **Power of the New Device**:
  \[
  2 \text{ kW/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ kW/day}
  \]
  
### Step 3: Calculate the total electricity consumption including the new device over a week.
- **Total Weekly Electricity Usage Including the New Device**:
  \[
  288 \text{ kWh/week} + 48 \text{ kW/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 288 \text{ kWh/week} + 336 \text{ kWh/week} = 624 \text{ kWh/week}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost difference due to the addition of the new device.
- **Cost Difference**:
  \[
  624 \text{ kWh/week} - 288 \text{ kWh/week} = 336 \text{ kWh/week}
  \]
  
- **Cost Calculation**:
  \[
  336 \text{ kWh/week} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$504
  \]

### Conclusion:
The difference in Ada’s weekly electricity bill before and after adding the new device is \$504.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$504}
\]<|im_end|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time required for five people to paint a ""whole"" house given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the work rate of one person:**
   - One person paints half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, the work rate of one person per day is \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since painting half a house takes 5 days).

2. **Calculate the combined work rate of five people:**
   - Since there are five people working together, their combined work rate will be \(5\) times the individual work rate.
   - So, the combined work rate of five people is \(5 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}\) (painting units per day).

3. **Determine the number of days required for five people to paint a whole house:**
   - To find out how many days it takes for five people to paint a whole house, divide the total amount of work (which is 1 unit) by their combined daily work rate.
   - The calculation is \(\text{days} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2}}\).
   - Simplifying this, we get \(\text{days} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{2}{5}\) days.

4. **Convert the number of days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, \(\text{hours} = \frac{2}{5} \times 24\).

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{5} = \frac{48}{5} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{48}{5}} \]<|im_end|>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   - Both Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs for each person:**
   - Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
     According to the problem, \( C_O = 20 \).

   - Let \( C_J \) be the number of chairs Jenna has.
     Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can write:
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times C_O
     \]
     Substituting the value of \( C_O \):
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times 20 = 60
     \]

3. **Verify the consistency of the information provided:**
   - The problem states that both Ophelia and Jenna have the same number of sofas. We know Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Therefore, Jenna also must have 20 sofas (as per the problem statement).

4. **Calculate the total number of sofas:**
   - Total number of sofas = Ophelia’s sofas + Jenna’s sofas
     \[
     \text{Total sofas} = 20 + 20 = 40
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**
   - Total number of chairs = Ophelia’s chairs + Jenna’s chairs
     \[
     \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 20 + 60 = 80
     \]

### Conclusion:
- The total number of sofas they have together is 40.
- The total number of chairs they have together is 80.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The total number of sofas is 40 and the total number of chairs is 80}}

   - Tom spent $4 on one CD.
   - Total amount spent = $48.

2. **Calculate the number of CDs Tom could originally buy:**
   - Number of CDs = Total amount / Price per CD
   - Number of CDs = $48 / $4 = 12 CDs

3. **Calculate how much money was spent on headphones:**
   - Since Tom bought two headphone sets (one for $4 and another for $4), the cost of the headphones is $4 + $4 = $8.

4. **Subtract the cost of the headphones from the total amount spent:**
   - Amount left after buying headphones = Total amount - Cost of headphones
   - Amount left = $48 - $8 = $40

5. **Determine how many CDs Tom could still buy with the remaining money:**
   - Number of additional CDs = Remaining money / Price per CD
   - Number of additional CDs = $40 / $4 = 10 CDs

6. **Find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphones:**
   - More CDs that can be bought = Original number of CDs - Additional CDs that can be bought

   - Since he spent 5 hours twice consecutively, this accounts for \(5 + 5 = 10\) hours.
   - Additionally, he spent 6 hours in one week, which adds another 6 hours.

4. **Combine the totals**:
   - The initial calculation of 32 hours plus the additional 10 hours (from the consecutive work) gives us \(32 + 10 = 42\) hours.
   - Adding the 6 hours from the single work session also results in \(42 + 6 = 48\) hours.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to carefully track how many passengers board or disembark at each stop. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
- Total initial number of passengers = 48

### Step 2: First Stop
- Number of passengers getting off = 8
- Number of passengers boarding = 0 (since no information is given about boarding)

#### Calculations for the first stop:
- Passengers remaining on the bus = 48 - 8 = 40

### Step 3: Second Stop
- Number of passengers getting off = 21
- Number of passengers boarding = 0 (same as before)

#### Calculations for the second stop:
- Passengers remaining on the bus = 40 - 21 = 19

### Final Answer:
After the second stop, there are **19** passengers riding on the bus.<|im_end|>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.
After the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.
At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Jame's future age:**
   - James turns 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, he was born 5 years ago when he turned 27.

2. **Calculate how many years have passed between now and when James turns 27:**
   - Since James turns 27 in 5 years from now, we need to subtract these 5 years from today's date to find out how many years have already passed since he was born.

3. **Set up an equation for James' age in 5 years:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of years that have passed since James was born. 
   - Currently, \( x = 0 \).
   - In 5 years, James will be \( x + 5 \).

4. **Use the given information about James turning 27 in 5 years:**
   - At the time James turns 27, he has been alive for \( x \) years (since he was born at \( x = 0 \)).
   - So, in 5 years, he will be 27 years old.

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know James will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - This means he has been alive for \( x = 27 \) years.

6. **Verify the total number of years that have passed since James was born:**
   - If James is currently 27 years old, then \( x = 27 \).

Therefore, the number of years that have separated their ages is \( x = 27 \).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 27.<|im_end|>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( C \) be the cost of the computer.
- \( M_1 \) be the cost of the first monitor.
- \( M_2 \) be the cost of the second monitor (assuming they are identical).
- \( P \) be the cost of the printer.

Given:
- The total cost for the computer, two monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- Errol paid $400 less for the printer compared to the computer.

From the given information:
\[ C = \$1,100 \]
\[ P = C - \$400 \]

### Step 2: Substitute and Solve for Printer Cost
Substitute \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

So, the printer costs $700.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost Excluding Computer and Monitors
We know the total cost including the computer and two monitors plus the printer is $2,400. We can express this as:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

### Step 4: Substitute Known Values
Now substitute \( C \), \( P \), and the number of monitors (\( n \)) into the equation:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

### Step 5: Solve for Monitor Cost
Isolate \( 2M \):
\[ 2M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is **$300**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } \$300}

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Total number of kids**: There are 20 kids.
   - Boys: Let's denote the number of boys as \( B \).
   - Girls: Since there are 20 kids total and we know that the boys made up half of them (because they're split equally), we can conclude that the number of boys must be 10.

2. **Number of shells per boy**: Each boy collected 60 seashells.
   - Therefore, the total number of shells collected by all boys is \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \) shells.

3. **Shells collected by girls**:
   - Let's denote the number of seashells collected by each girl as \( G \).

4. **Given condition**: The girls collect shells such that it equals the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many shells as the boys have collected.
   - This translates to: \( 20G = 600 + 4 \times 600 \)

5. **Calculate the sum inside the parentheses**:
   - \( 600 + 4 \times 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \).

6. **Set up the equation**:
   - We now have: \( 20G = 3000 \).

7. **Solve for \( G \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 20: \( G = \frac{3000}{20} = 150 \).

Therefore, each girl collected 150 seashells.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine George's initial number of candies:**
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George initially had.
   - According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick initially had \( 2G \) candies.

2. **Account for George eating candies:**
   - George eats 5 candies.
   - After eating, George has \( G - 5 \) candies left.

3. **Set up an equation based on the information given:**
   - The problem states that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 candies left.
     Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     G = 8
     \]
   So, George initially had 8 candies.

5. **Calculate the initial number of candies Nick had:**
   - Since Nick had twice as many candies as George:
     \[
     \text{Nick's initial candies} = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

Therefore, Nick originally had 16 candies. 

**Final Answer:**

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Alyana's age
Given that Chenny is 10 years old, and Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = 10 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = 6 \]

So, Alyana is 6 years old.

### Step 2: Determine Anne's age
Now that we know Alyana is 6 years old, and Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:
\[ \text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Anne's age} = 6 + 2 \]

2. **Determine the thickness of the second book:**
   - Let's denote the thickness of the second book as \( x \) mm.
   - According to the problem, the second book is 50 mm thick.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of the tip:**
   - The bill is $50.
   - The wife wants to add 20% as a tip.

   First, calculate 20% of $50:
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10

   So, the tip should be $10.

2. **Calculate the total amount including the tip:**
   - Subtract the tip from the original bill to find out how much we actually paid:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]

   Therefore, you ended up paying $40 for the meal.

3. **Verify the distribution of the bill:**
   - Since there were two people (you and your wife), divide the remaining $40 equally between both of you:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20

   This means that after adding the tip, each person ends up paying $20.

So, the final answer is:

Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how much each boy gets initially.
There are three boys, and they share an amount that we'll call \( S \).

\[ S = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, each boy initially receives $6.

### Step 2: Calculate what happens when the eldest boy adds extra amounts.
- The eldest boy adds $5 to his share.
  - His new share becomes: \( 6 + 5 = 11 \)

- The eldest boy then adds another $10 on top of those $5.
  - His additional sum becomes: \( 10 \)
  - Therefore, his total for today is: \( 11 + 10 = 21 \)

### Step 3: Calculate how much the eldest boy spends.
He spends $8.

### Step 4: Determine how much the eldest boy has left before tripling it.
After spending $8, the eldest boy has:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

### Step 5: Triple the remaining amount.
The amount the eldest boy has left (after spending) is $13. Tripling this amount gives us:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \]

Therefore, the eldest boy can triple the amount he has left ($13), which results in him having $39.

### Conclusion:
The final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    Elvis has a : monthly saving target of $1125. In April, ! he wants to ; save ; twice as much , daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in , order to hit his target. ; How much , does he : have to save for ? each ? day ? in , the second ! half ! of the month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis should save each day in the second half of the month. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total savings needed for the second half of the month.
Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. The second half of the month consists of about 30 days (assuming a standard month).

\[
\text{Total savings needed} = \$1125 \times 30 = \$33750
\]

### Step 2: Determine the amount saved in the first half of the month.
Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half compared to the first half, let \( x \) be the amount saved in the first half.

\[
x + 2x = \$1125
\]
\[
3x = \$1125
\]
\[
x = \$1125 / 3 = \$375
\]

So, Elvis saves $375 per day in the first half of the month.

### Step 3: Calculate the total savings in the first half of the month.
\[
\text{Total savings in the first half} = \$375 \times 15 = \$5625
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining amount to be saved in the second half.
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = \$33750 - \$5625 = \$28125
\]

### Step 5: Determine the number of days in the second half of the month.
As mentioned earlier, the second half of the month includes approximately 30 days.

### Step 6: Calculate the daily savings required in the second half of the month.
Let \( y \) be the amount saved each day in the second half.

\[
y \times 30 = \$28125
\]
\[
y = \$28125 / 30 = \$937.50
\]

Therefore, Elvis needs to save $937.50 each day in the second half of the month.

### Final Answer:
Each day in the second half of the month, Elvis has to save $\boxed{937.50}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits purchased.
- **Apples**: Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of apples} = 3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50
  \]

- **Oranges**: Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of oranges} = 5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00
  \]

- **Peaches**: Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of peaches} = 6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total cost of all fruits.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount given.
Verna gave $20.
\[
\text{Change received} = \$20 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the final answer is that Verna receives $\boxed{7}$ in change.<|im_end|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.

Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much more money Jairus will receive compared to Jenny after they both finish 20 tasks.

1. **Calculate the total amount Jairus earns:**
   - Jairus earns $0.8 per task.
   - He finishes 20 tasks.
   \[
   \text{Jairus's earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount Jenny earns:**
   - Jenny earns $0.5 per task.
   - She also finishes 20 tasks.
   \[
   \text{Jenny's earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the difference in their earnings:**
   - Subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Jairus will earn $6 more than Jenny.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 6.<|im_end|>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jeff receives based on the given ratio. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( J \) represent the amount of money Jeff gets.
Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad gets.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. This can be written as:
\[ J = 4B \]

### Step 3: Determine Total Amount
We know that the total amount of money is $100. Therefore:
\[ J + B = 100 \]

### Step 4: Substitute and Solve for One Variable
Substitute \( J = 4B \) into the equation \( J + B = 100 \):
\[ 4B + B = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( B \)
Divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

### Step 6: Find \( J \)
Now substitute \( B = 20 \) back into the equation \( J = 4B \):
\[ J = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ J = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets $\boxed{80}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Brad gets 100/5=<<100/5=20>>20 dollars.

To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to break down his daily walking distance and then multiply it by the number of days he works per week.

1. **Determine one round trip distance:**
   - Jeff's work location is 3 miles away.
   - Walking from home to work (one way) = 3 miles.
   - Returning home after working at the job (round trip) = 2 * 3 miles = 6 miles.

2. **Calculate total miles for one day:**
   - Jeff works every day and travels back and forth between his home and the work location.
   - One-way distance = 3 miles.
   - Round trip distance = 6 miles.
   - Total miles for one day = 3 miles (to work) + 6 miles (back home) = 9 miles.

3. **Calculate total miles walked in a week:**
   - Jeff works 5 days a week.
   - Daily distance = 9 miles.
   - Weekly distance = 9 miles/day * 5 days/week = 45 miles.

To determine how many letters Elise has written in total, we need to break down her process step by step.

1. **First Write:**
   - Elise writes ""it"". This contains 3 letters.
   - Elise writes ""!"". This contains 2 letters.
   - Total so far: \(3 + 2 = 5\) letters.

2. **Second Write (Half of ""it""):**
   - Elise writes ""it"" again. As mentioned before, this contains 3 letters.
   - Elise writes ""!"" again. This contains 2 letters.
   - Total for this part: \(3 + 2 = 5\) letters.

3. **Third Write (Half of what she wrote):**
   - Elise now writes ""half"". This contains 4 letters.

1. **Initial Call**: Ali makes the first call to three families.
   - Number of families notified: \(3\)

2. **Second Round**:
   - Each of these 3 families makes another call to 3 more families.
   - Since there are 3 families making calls in the second round, we have \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new families notified.

3. **Third Round**:
   - Now, we have 9 families that made their initial call, plus the 9 from the previous round.
   - These 9 families make calls to 3 more families each.
   - Total number of new families notified: \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

4. **Fourth Round**:
   - We now have 27 families that made their initial calls, plus the 27 from the previous round.
   - These 27 families make calls to 3 more families each.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight based on the information provided about his weight loss over time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Mark lost 10 pounds every month.
   - He was unwell for 3 months.
   - His final weight after these 3 months was 70 pounds.

2. **Calculate Total Weight Loss Over 3 Months:**
   - Since Mark loses 10 pounds per month, in 3 months he would lose \( 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds}\).

3. **Determine Initial Weight:**
   - Let \( W_0 \) represent Mark’s initial weight.
   - After losing 30 pounds over 3 months, his final weight should be \( W_0 - 30 \).
   - According to the problem, his final weight is 70 pounds.

4. **Set Up Equation:**
   \[
   W_0 - 30 = 70
   \]

5. **Solve for Initial Weight:**
   \[
   W_0 = 70 + 30 = 100

   - James's playset contains 80 toys.

2. **Calculate the minimum number of toys in one full playset that Jonathan requires:**
   - Since Jonathan’s playset must be at least as large as James's playset, it means his playset should contain at least 80 toys.

3. **Calculate the total number of toys in five such playsets:**
   - If one playset requires at least 80 toys, then five such playsets would require \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost before any discounts and then apply the discount.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item without discount

- **Notebook**: $1.50 per notebook
- **Pen**: $0.25 per pen
- **Calculator**: $12 per calculator
- **Geometry Set**: $10 per geometry set

Since Daniel wants to buy these items in specific quantities, let's calculate the total cost for each type of item:

- **Five Notebooks**:
  \[
  5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50
  \]

- **Two Pens**:
  \[
  2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50
  \]

- **One Calculator**:
  \[
  1 \times \$12 = \$12
  \]

- **One Geometry Set**:
  \[
  1 \times \$10 = \$10
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the costs of all items

\[
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$30
\]

So, without any discount, the total cost would be $30.

### Step 3: Apply the discount

The shop offers a 10% discount on all items purchased. To find out how much the discount is, we first calculate 10% of the total cost ($30):

\[
10\% \text{ of } \$30 = 0.10 \times \$30 = \$3
\]

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost:

\[
\$30 - \$3 = \$27
\]

### Final Answer

Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy after applying the discount. 

\[
\boxed{\$27}
\]<|im_end|>","Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50

The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.
Thus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.
Therefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.

                    question:
                    Carly . wants to treat her , friends. She orders five hamburgers at $4 each, . ten packs of potato fries ; at $0.30 each ? pack, and ! five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each ! can. ,  How , much change ! does Carly get back if . she ; gives : one fifty-dollar bill?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered and then determine how much change she gets back from an initial payment of one hundred dollars.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the hamburgers:**
   - Number of hamburgers = 5
   - Cost per hamburger = $4
   - Total cost for hamburgers = \( 5 \times 4 = $20 \)

2. **Calculate the cost of the potato fries:**
   - Number of packs of potato fries = 10
   - Cost per pack = $0.30
   - Total cost for potato fries = \( 10 \times 0.30 = $3 \)

3. **Calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:**
   - Number of cans of fruit drinks = 5
   - Cost per can = $2
   - Total cost for fruit drinks = \( 5 \times 2 = $10 \)

4. **Add up all the costs to find the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of hamburgers + Cost of potato fries + Cost of fruit drinks
   - Total cost = $20 (hamburgers) + $3 (potato fries) + $10 (fruit drinks)
   - Total cost = $33

5. **Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount given (one hundred dollars):**
   - Initial amount given = $100
   - Change received = $100 - $33
   - Change received = $67

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The change Carly receives is $67.<|im_end|>","The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
The cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.
And, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.

                    question:
                    A marketing company pays its ? employees ; on a commission-based salary , system. ? If you sell goods worth , $1000, you earn a : 30% commission.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the base commission rate for sales up to $1000
Given that Antonella sells goods worth $1000, her earnings from these sales would be calculated at a 30% commission rate because this is the base threshold where the initial commission applies.

- Base commission rate = 30%

### Step 2: Calculate the base commission for selling goods worth $1000
\[ \text{Base commission} = \$1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

### Step 3: Determine the commission for sales above $1000
If Antonella's total sales exceed $1000, there is an additional 10% commission applied to any sales over $1000.

- Additional commission rate = 10%
- Total sales > $1000, so no further adjustments needed beyond the initial 30%.

### Step 4: Calculate the total commission for sales worth $2500
Since the total sales are $2500, which exceeds $1000, we calculate the additional commission only for the part exceeding $1000:

- Commission on sales above $1000 = ($2500 - $1000) × 0.10 = $1500 × 0.10 = $150

### Step 5: Add the base commission to the additional commission
Total commission = Base commission + Additional commission
\[ \text{Total commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, Antonella's total earnings after selling goods worth $2500 are $450. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles available:**
   - Bill starts with 2 cases.
   - Each case contains 24 bottles.

\[
\text{Total available bottles} = \text{Number of cases} \times \text{Bottles per case}
\]

\[
\text{Total available bottles} = 2 \times 24 = 48
\]

2. **Determine the total number of guests:**
   - Bill expects 70 guests.

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed:**
   - Bill wants to provide 2 bottles per guest.

\[
\text{Total bottles needed} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Bottles per guest}
\]

\[
\text{Total bottles needed} = 70 \times 2 = 140
\]

4. **Subtract the available bottles from the total needed:**

\[
\text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Available bottles}
\]

\[
\text{Additional bottles needed} = 140 - 48 = 92
\]

Therefore, Bill needs to buy an additional **92** bottles of water.<|im_end|>","Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, so he has 24 * 2 = <<2*24=48>>48 bottles of water

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the time taken for one mile on a cold day.
- On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes.

### Step 2: Determine the time taken for three miles on a cold day.
- Since he swims at the same speed (assuming his swimming pace remains constant), if he swims 1 mile in 16 minutes, then for 3 miles, he would take:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes per mile}} = 0.1875 \times 3 = 0.5625 \text{ hours} \]
Converting hours into minutes:
\[ 0.5625 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 33.75 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Determine the time taken for one mile on a hot day.
- On a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in less time than on a cold day. According to the problem, it takes him twice as long to swim 1 mile on a hot day.
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{16 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Determine the time taken for three miles on a hot day.
- For 3 miles, since he swims at the same speed, he will take:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{8 \text{ minutes per mile}} = 0.375 \times 3 = 1.125 \text{ hours} \]
Converting hours into minutes:
\[ 1.125 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 67.5 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in time between a hot day and a cold day.
- The difference in time is:
\[ 67.5 \text{ minutes} - 33.75 \text{ minutes} = 33.75 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Ray takes **33.75 minutes** longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.<|im_end|>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break down John's earnings and savings into steps:

1. **Calculate daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours per day.

   Daily earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked
   Daily earnings = $2/hour × 5 hours/day
   Daily earnings = $10/day

2. **Calculate weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days a week.

   Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked
   Weekly earnings = $10/day × 4 days/week
   Weekly earnings = $40/week

3. **Determine total savings needed:**
   - John wants to save $80 in total.

4. **Calculate the number of weeks required to reach his goal:**
   - We know that John saves $40 every week.
   
   Number of weeks = Total savings ÷ Weekly savings
   Number of weeks = $80 ÷ $40/week
   Number of weeks = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.<|im_end|>","He gets paid 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 a day.

   - The price for a foot-long fish sub is $40.
   - The price for a six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times that of the fish sub.

2. **Calculate the price for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:**
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many holes there are in total among all the buttons.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the total number of buttons:**
   - The bag contains 21 buttons.

2. **Determine the number of buttons that have holes:**
   - We know that seven buttons have two holes.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of buttons that have four holes.

3. **Set up an equation based on the total number of buttons:**
   - The sum of the buttons with two holes and those with four holes should equal the total number of buttons.
   \[
   7 \times 2 + x \times 4 = 21
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Calculate \( 7 \times 2 \):
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     14 + 4x = 21
     \]
   - Subtract 14 from both sides:
     \[
     4x = 21 - 14
     \]
     \[
     4x = 7
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75
     \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of buttons that have four holes, and we cannot have a fraction of a button, we recognize that our initial assumption about the distribution must hold true.

6. **Re-evaluate the distribution:**
   - Given that seven buttons already account for some holes (two), let's reframe the problem.
   - If seven buttons have two holes each, then these seven buttons alone contribute \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) holes.
   - This leaves us with \( 21 - 14 = 7 \) buttons that do not have any holes.

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - With no holes in these 7 buttons, and assuming the remaining 7 buttons also have no holes as per the problem statement,
   - This means all buttons indeed have either two or four holes.

8. **Calculate the total number of holes:**
   - Buttons with two holes: \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \)
   - Total holes: \( 14 + 0 = 14 \)

### Conclusion:
There are a total of 14 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","There were 21 - 7 = <<21-7=14>>14 buttons with four holes.

Thus, there were 56 + 14 = <<56+14=70>>70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan should drink after reducing it according to his doctor's advice.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Octavia's Coffee Intake:**
   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended number of cups.
   - The daily recommended number of cups for coffee is \( x \).
   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{x}{2} \) cups per day.

2. **Calculate the Amount Juan Drinks Initially:**
   - According to the problem, Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks.
   - So, Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{x}{2} = 5x \) cups per day.

3. **Determine the Daily Recommendation:**
   - Juan's doctor recommends he reduces his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

4. **Set Up an Equation:**
   - Let \( y \) be the reduction in cups from the initial amount Juan drinks.
   - After the reduction, Juan will consume \( (5x - y) \) cups per day.

5. **Express the Final Amount Juan Drinks as Per Day:**
   - Since the doctor's recommendation is 4 cups per day, we set up the equation:
     \[
     5x - y = 4
     \]

6. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to find \( y \):
     \[
     y = 5x - 4
     \]
   - Substitute the value of \( x \) back into the equation. However, since \( x \) represents the daily recommended number of cups, let's assume \( x = 8 \) cups (a common recommendation), which means:
     \[
     y = 5(8) - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups

Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Susan's weight**
- Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.

\[
\text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \text{ pounds}
\]

Substitute Mark's weight into the equation:

\[
\text{Susan's weight} = 150 \text{ pounds} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 130 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Bob's weight**
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

\[
\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight}
\]

Substitute Susan's weight into the equation:

\[
\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 \text{ pounds} = 260 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the three friends**

Add up all the weights:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}
\]

Substitute the weights into the equation:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 \text{ pounds} + 130 \text{ pounds} + 260 \text{ pounds} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the average weight**

Divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3):

\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of friends}}
\]

Substitute the values into the equation:

\[
\text{Average weight} = \frac{540 \text{ pounds}}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is **180 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.
Bob weighs 2 * 130 pounds = <<2*130=260>>260 pounds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total change in elevation of the sun above the ground over a given time period. Here’s our step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We know that the sun moves upwards at a rate of 5° per hour.
- We also know the initial angle between the sun and the ground (the pyramid) is 32°.
- We need to find out the total angle after 10 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Change in Elevation
Since the sun moves up at a constant rate of 5° per hour, we can determine its total movement over 10 hours.

\[ \text{Total Movement} = \text{Rate of Movement} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Total Movement} = 5°/hour \times 10\ \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Movement} = 50° \]

### Step 3: Add Initial Angle to the Total Movement
Now, add the initial angle (32°) to the total movement (50°).

\[ \text{Final Angle} = \text{Initial Angle} + \text{Total Movement} \]
\[ \text{Final Angle} = 32° + 50° \]
\[ \text{Final Angle} = 82° \]

### Conclusion
After considering the sun's movement for 10 hours, the final angle between the sun and the ground (relative to Sahir's house) will be **82°** from the ground.<|im_end|>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the age difference between the two sons.
2. Calculate how many packs of candles are needed based on their ages.
3. Find out how many candles are in one pack.
4. Calculate the total cost.

Step 1: The age difference between the two sons is given as 4 years.

Step 2: We know that one son is 12 years old. Therefore, the other son's age can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Age of the second son} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

Step 3: Now, we calculate how many packs of candles are needed. Since one pack contains 5 candles, we divide the number of candles required by the number of candles per pack:
\[ \text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of candles}}{\text{Candles per pack}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

Step 4: Each pack costs $3, so the total amount James spends is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 4 \times 3 = \$12 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of minutes Judy spent reading each night over two weeks and then calculate the total number of pages she read.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate the total time Judy spends reading each night:
   - First week: Judy reads for 15 minutes each night.
   
   Total time for one night = 15 minutes
   
   Since there are 7 days in a week,
   Total time for one week (first week) = 15 minutes/day * 7 days/week = 105 minutes/week
   
   Therefore, for the first week, Judy read for **105 minutes** each night.

#### 2. Determine the total time Judy spends reading during the second week:
   - Second week: Judy reads a total of 100 pages.
   
   Given that Judy can read 2 pages every 1.5 minutes,
   We can set up a proportion to find out how long it takes her to read 1 page:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{2} = \frac{x}{1}
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per page}
   \]

   Now, if she reads 100 pages in the second week,
   The total time she spends reading in the second week is:
   \[
   100 \times 0.75 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### 3. Calculate the total time Judy spends reading over the two weeks:
   - For the first week, she spent 105 minutes each night.
   - For the second week, she spent 75 minutes each night.
   
   Therefore, the total time spent reading over two weeks is:
   \[
   105 + 75 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### 4. Convert the total time into hours:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour,
   So, the total time in hours is:
   \[
   \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

#### Conclusion:
Judy spent a total of **180 minutes** or **3 hours** reading over two weeks.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sandwiches Cody ate.
2. Determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
3. Subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.

Step 1: Calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the sandwiches.
Total sandwiches = 12
Number of sandwiches Cody ate = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12\)

Step 2: Calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.
Number of sandwiches Trevor ate = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12\)

Step 3: Subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches.
Remaining sandwiches = Total sandwiches - (Cody's sandwiches + Trevor's sandwiches)

Now let's do the calculations:

1. Number of sandwiches Cody ate = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\)
2. Number of sandwiches Trevor ate = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\)
3. Remaining sandwiches = 12 - (4 + 3) = 12 - 7 = 5

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Shiloh's nephew given that in seven years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Shiloh's current age.
   Let \( N \) represent the nephew's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Shiloh’s current age = \( S = 44 \).
   - In seven years, Shiloh will be \( S + 7 \) years old.
   - In seven years, the nephew will be \( N + 7 \) years old.

3. **Use the Relationship Between Their Ages:**
   According to the problem, in seven years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew:
   \[
   S + 7 = 3(N + 7)
   \]

4. **Substitute Shiloh's Age into the Equation:**
   Since \( S = 44 \), substitute it into the equation:
   \[
   44 + 7 = 3(N + 7)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   51 = 3(N + 7)
   \]

5. **Solve for the Nephew's Age:**
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{51}{3} = N + 7
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   17 = N + 7
   \]
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   17 - 7 = N

To solve this problem, we need to break down the payments made by the Tooth Fairy to Sharon based on her lost teeth.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **First Tooth:**

2. **Next Three Teeth (for the second, third, and fourth tooth):**
   - For each of these three teeth, the Tooth Fairy gives Sharon $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth = \(3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00\).

3. **Last Two Teeth (for the fifth and sixth tooth):**
   - For each of these two teeth, the Tooth Fairy gives Sharon half the amount she received from the previous three teeth.
   - Amount received from the previous three teeth = \$3.00.
   - Half of this amount = \(\$3.00 / 2 = \$1.50\).
   - Total for these two teeth = \(2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00\).

4. **Total Money Left by the Tooth Fairy:**
   - Sum up all the amounts given to Sharon.
   - First tooth: \$5.00
   - Next three teeth: \$3.00
   - Last two teeth: \$3.00
   - Total = \$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$3.00 = \$11.00.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each teenager based on the given information.

1. **Identify the total goals scored:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.
   - Let's denote the number of goals scored by Mark as \( M \).
   - Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \).

2. **Set up equations based on the given conditions:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: 
     \[
     R = M + 20
     \]
     where \( R \) represents the goals scored by Richie.
   - Mark scored 45 more goals than Anna:
     \[
     M = A + 45
     \]

3. **Substitute the known values into the equations:**
   - We know that Richie scored 80 goals:
     \[
     80 = M + 20
     \]
     Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 80 - 20 = 60

4. **Calculate the goals scored by Anna using her relationship to Mark:**
   - Mark scored 60 goals:
     \[
     60 = A + 45
     \]
     Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 60 - 45 = 15

5. **Summarize the goals scored by each teenager:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.
   - Mark scored 60 goals.
   - Anna scored 15 goals.

6. **Add up the goals scored by all three teenagers:**
   \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Liam made.
Liam claimed to have made $63.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Mitchell made based on the number of lemonades he sold.
- Mitchell said he sold 21 lemonades.
- Each lemonade was priced at $4.

First, calculate the total revenue for Mitchell:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of Lemonades Sold} \times \text{Price per Lemonade} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = 21 \times 4 \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 84 \]

So, Mitchell made $84 in that weekend.

### Step 3: Compare the amounts made by both Liam and Mitchell.
- Liam made $63.
- Mitchell made $84.

### Step 4: Find out how much more money Mitchell made compared to Liam.
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Mitchell's Revenue} - \text{Liam's Revenue} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 84 - 63 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ \text{Difference} = 21 \]

Therefore, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.

### Final Answer:

                    question:
                    Peter has $70 and wishes to spend ? an equal ? amount ? each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, ; he spent his , money on wooden action figures which cost $5 , each. For the : rest of the week, : he , will : buy plastic ! action figures which cost $2 . each. How ; many , total action figures will he ? have ! by , the ! end of the week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount**: Peter starts with $70.
2. **Cost per Wooden Action Figure**: Each wooden action figure costs $5.
3. **Number of Days for Wooden Figures**: Peter spends from Sunday to Wednesday, which is 4 days.

   - Cost for 4 days = 4 * $5 = $20
   - Remaining Money after 4 days = $70 - $20 = $50

4. **Cost per Plastic Action Figure**: Each plastic action figure costs $2.
5. **Number of Days for Plastic Figures**: The remaining days are Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, which is 4 more days (since we already counted the first 4 days).

   - Cost for 4 days = 4 * $2 = $8
   - Remaining Money after 4 days = $50 - $8 = $42

6. **Total Number of Action Figures Purchased**:
   - Number of Wooden Action Figures: $\frac{4}{5} \approx 0.8$ (rounding down since you can't purchase a fraction of an action figure)
   - Number of Plastic Action Figures: $\frac{4}{2} = 2$

Since Peter cannot purchase a fractional number of action figures, he buys whole numbers based on the available funds at each point in time.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - After spending on wooden action figures, he still has some money left ($50), but not enough to buy any more wooden figures.
   - With the remaining $42, he buys as many plastic action figures as possible. He can buy $\frac{42}{2} = 21$ plastic action figures.

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have purchased a total of 21 plastic action figures.

### Conclusion:
Peter will have a total of 21 action figures by the end of the week. 

{The final answer is} 21<|im_end|>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10

He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures
Altogether, he will have 8+15 = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Leah has spent on her kitten so far, we need to break down all the costs she incurred.

1. **Spaying Cost:**
   - The spaying cost for the kitten is $200.
   
2. **Vaccines Cost:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20, and there are three vaccines.
   - Total cost for vaccines = \( 3 \times \$20 \) = $60.

3. **Broken Vases Cost:**
   - The kitten broke four vases, and each vase costs $12.
   - Total cost for broken vases = \( 4 \times \$12 \) = $48.

Now, let's add up all these costs:

- Spaying cost: $200
- Vaccine cost: $60
- Broken vase cost: $48

Total cost so far = \( \$200 + \$60 + \$48 \)

Let's perform the addition:

\[
\$200 + \$60 = \$260
\]

\[
\$260 + \$48 = \$308
\]

Therefore, the total amount Leah has spent on her kitten so far is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply to all the flower shops in one month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses supplied weekly.
2. Determine the total number of weeks in a month.
3. Multiply the total number of roses supplied weekly by the number of weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses supplied weekly.
Ford's garden produces 40 roses per week for each flower shop order. Therefore, the total number of roses supplied weekly is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total roses per week} = 40 \times (\text{number of flower shops}) \]

Since there are three flower shops, we have:

\[ \text{Total roses per week} = 40 \times (1 + 20 + 30) = 40 \times 51 = 2040 \]

Step 2: Determine the total number of weeks in a month.
Assuming an average month has about 4 weeks (since 30 days ≈ 4 weeks), we can calculate the total number of weeks in a month as:

\[ \text{Number of weeks in a month} = 4 \]

Step 3: Multiply the total number of roses supplied weekly by the number of weeks in a month.
Now, multiply the total number of roses supplied weekly by the number of weeks in a month:

\[ \text{Total roses in a month} = 2040 \times 4 = 8160 \]

So, Ford needs to supply 8160 roses in a month to meet the demand from all the flower shops.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8160}
\]<|im_end|>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.

So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

\[ \text{Number of months} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Step 2: Determine the total amount removed from the account each month.
\[ \text{Total amount removed per month} = \$100 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total amount removed over 24 months.
\[ \text{Total amount removed} = \$100 \times 24 = \$2400 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total amount removed from the initial amount.
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

To determine the food truck's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling sandwiches**

- The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of making the sandwiches**

- Each sandwich uses one loaf of bread, and the price of a loaf is $3.00.
\[
\text{Cost per loaf} = \$3.00
\]
- Each sandwich requires one loaf of bread.
\[
\text{Number of loaves used} = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]
- Total cost of bread:
\[
\text{Total Cost of Bread} = 10 \times \$3.00 = \$30.00
\]

**Step 3: Determine the amount spent on cheese and condiments**

- The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments for each batch of 10 sandwiches.

**Step 4: Calculate the total expenses**

- **Total Cost (Bread + Condiments)**
\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \$30.00 (\text{bread}) + \$30.00 (\text{condiments}) = \$60.00
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the net profit**

- Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 (\text{Revenue}) - \$60.00 (\text{Expenses}) = \$10.00

Let's break this problem down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of small crayon pieces.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.
- There are 3 boxes.

Total number of crayons = Number of boxes * Number per box
= 3 * 64
= 192 crayons

### Step 2: Calculate how many muffin batches Kate can make.
- She uses 8 small pieces from each box.
- She has 192 crayons in total.

Number of batches = Total crayons / Crayons per batch

To find out how many birds Mack sees on average per day, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Days
First, let's determine the total number of days over which Mack observed the birds.

- Days one and two: 2 days
- Days three, four, five, and six: 4 + 5 = 9 days (since he saw no birds on those days)
- Day seven: 1 day

Total number of days = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12 days

### Step 2: Sum up all the observations
Now, add up all the numbers of birds seen during these days.
Birds seen on day one: 50
Birds seen on day two: 50
Birds seen on day three: 0
Birds seen on day four: 120
Birds seen on day five: 120
Birds seen on day six: 20
Birds seen on day seven: 90

Sum of birds seen = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 470 birds

### Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of days
Finally, divide the total number of birds seen by the total number of days to get the average number of birds seen per day.

Average number of birds seen per day = 470 / 12 ≈ 39.17

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number in the number train.
   
2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - The starting value is 20.
   - Half of the number (i.e., \( \frac{x}{2} \)) is added to it.
   - The result is then divided by 5.
   - Finally, the result is multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \right) \div 5 \times (20 - 12)
   \]

4. **Simplify inside the parentheses first:**
   - Calculate \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   So, the expression becomes:
   \[
   \left( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \right) \div 5 \times 8
   \]

5. **Distribute the multiplication by 8:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{x}{2} + 20 \right) \times \frac{8}{5}
   \]

6. **Simplify further:**
   - Distribute \( \frac{8}{5} \):
     \[
     \frac{8x}{10} + \frac{160}{5} = \frac{4x}{5} + \frac{160}{5} = \frac{4x}{5} + 32
     \]
   - Combine terms:
     \[
     \frac{4x}{5} + 32
     \]

7. **Substitute back into the original expression:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{4x}{5} + 32 \right) \div 5
   \]

8. **Simplify the division by 5:**
   - Distribute \( \frac{1}{5} \):
     \[
     \frac{4x}{25} + \frac{32}{5}
     \]

9. **Combine like terms:**
   - Convert \(\frac{32}{5}\) to a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{4x}{25} + \frac{160}{25}
     \]
   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{4x + 160}{25}
     \]

10. **Final check if there's any simplification possible:**
    - Since no further simplification can be done, we stop here.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the final value of the number train is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct setting for Maggie's oven given that it is currently malfunctioning but still works correctly when set to 450 degrees. We also know that the oven is off by the same percentage as its current malfunction.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the percentage difference between the current settings:**
   - Current setting (correct): 450 degrees
   - Actual temperature: 468 degrees

   The difference in temperature is \( |468 - 450| = 18 \) degrees.
   
   To find the percentage difference, use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Correct Value}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \approx 4\%
   \]

2. **Apply the same percentage difference to the recipe's required temperature:**
   - Recipe requires 520 degrees.

   Using the calculated percentage difference (4%):
   \[
   \text{Adjusted Temperature} = \text{Recipe Requirement} \times (1 + \text{Percentage Difference})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 \times (1 + 0.04)
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   \text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 \times 1.04
   \]
   Finally:
   \[
   \text{Adjusted Temperature} = 532.8
   \]

### Conclusion:
Maggie should set her oven to approximately 532.8 degrees to compensate for its malfunction and ensure consistency across all recipes. 

Therefore, the final answer is:  
{The final answer is} 532.8<|im_end|>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

To determine how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to convert all times into minutes and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Convert the time of the first movie.
- **First Movie**:
  - Duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes
  - 1 hour = 60 minutes
  - 30 minutes = 30 minutes
  - Total duration for the first movie in minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

### Step 2: Convert the time of the second movie.
- **Second Movie**:
  - Duration: 2 hours and 5 minutes
  - 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
  - 5 minutes = 5 minutes
  - Total duration for the second movie in minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

### Step 3: Sum the total time required for both movies.
- Time for the first movie: 90 minutes
- Time for the second movie: 125 minutes
- Total time in minutes = 90 + 125 = 215 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of Juan's house based on the information provided.
2. Add the values of both houses together.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate the value of Juan's house

We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. This means that if \( V_J \) represents the value of Juan's house, then:

\[ V_J = \text{Herb's house price} - (0.30 \times \text{Herb's house price}) \]

Given that Herb's house cost $76,000, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ V_J = \$76,000 - (0.30 \times \$76,000) \]
\[ V_J = \$76,000 - \$22,800 \]
\[ V_J = \$53,200 \]

So, the value of Juan's house is $53,200.

### Step 2: Calculate the total value of both houses combined

Now, we add the value of Juan's house ($53,200) to the value of Herb's house ($76,000):

\[ \text{Total Value} = V_J + \text{Herb's house price} \]
\[ \text{Total Value} = \$53,200 + \$76,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Value} = \$129,200 \]

Therefore, the combined value of both houses is **$129,200**.<|im_end|>","Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, meaning Juan's house is 30/100*$76000= $<<30/100*76000=22800>>22800 less expensive than Herb's house.
Juan's house is worth $76000-$22800 = $<<76000-22800=53200>>53200
The combined total value of Juan's and Herb's house is $76000+$53200 = $<<76000+53200=129200>>129200

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought one dozen (12) cups.
   - She also bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   
   Since there are 12 cups, twice as many dishes would be:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of utensils Judy originally brought:**
   - Cups: 12
   - Dishes: 24
   
   Total:
   \[
   12 + 24 = 36 \text{ utensils}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference between Judy’s and her friend’s amounts at the event:**
   - Friend brought: 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy.
   
   Let \( J \) represent the number of dishes Judy originally brought. Therefore:
   \[
   J = 24 \text{ (dishes)}
   \]
   
   According to the problem, the friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy did:
   \[
   J + 20 = 40
   \]
   
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   24 + 20 = 40 \Rightarrow J = 24
   \]

4. **Find out how many cups Judy actually brought at the event:**
   - The friend brought 40 cups.
   - Judy brought 20 fewer cups than the friend:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of utensils Judy brought at the event:**
   - Cups: 20
   - Dishes: 24
   
   Total:
   \[
   20 + 24 = 44 \text{ utensils}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils both friends brought together:**
   - Judy’s total: 44
   - Friend’s total: 40 cups + 20 more dishes than Judy brings (24 dishes)
   
   Total:
   \[
   44 + 40 = 84 \text{ utensils}
   \]

**Final Answer:** The total number of utensils brought by the two is **84**.<|im_end|>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of contacts.
2. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the discount.
4. Divide the discounted cost by the total number of contacts.

Step 1: Determine the total number of contacts.
Pete has 90 single contacts per box, and there are 10 boxes.
Total number of contacts = 90 contacts/box * 10 boxes = 900 contacts.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost before the discount.
Each box costs $100.00, so for 10 boxes, it would be:
Total cost before discount = $100.00/box * 10 boxes = $1000.00.

Step 3: Apply the discount.
There is a 10% discount on each box. So, the price after discount is:
Discounted price per box = $100.00 - (10% of $100.00) = $100.00 - ($10.00) = $90.00.

Now calculate the total cost after applying the discount for all 10 boxes:
Total cost after discount = $90.00/box * 10 boxes = $900.00.

Step 4: Divide the discounted cost by the total number of contacts.
Number of pairs of contacts = 900 contacts / 2 contacts/pair = 450 pairs.
Cost per pair = Total cost after discount / Number of pairs = $900.00 / 450 pairs ≈ $2.00/pair.

Therefore, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the cost per pair of contacts will be approximately $2.00.

The final answer is: The final answer is $2.00.<|im_end|>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off

To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their earnings based on the given information about their work hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate Jill's total earnings:
- Jill worked for a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours.
- Jill earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Jill's Total Earnings} = 3 \times 10 = \$30 \]

#### 2. Calculate John's working hours:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.

Thus, John’s total working hours are \(4 + 3 = 7\) hours.

#### 3. Calculate John's total earnings:
- John also earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{John's Total Earnings} = 7 \times 10 = \$70 \]

#### 4. Compare John's and Jill's earnings:
- John's earnings (\$70) - Jill's earnings (\$30)

\[
\text{Difference in Earnings} = \$70 - \$30 = \$40

To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories burned from both activities**

- **Aerobics**: Hannah runs for 2 hours at a rate of 500 calories per hour.
\[ \text{Calories from Aerobics} = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \text{ calories} \]

- **Running**: Hannah runs for 1 hour at a rate of 600 calories per hour.
\[ \text{Calories from Running} = 1 \times 600 = 600 \text{ calories} \]

- **Total Calories Burned**:
\[ \text{Total Calories} = 1000 + 600 = 1600 \text{ calories} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of water needed based on the calorie burn**

According to the information provided, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

- **Water Requirement Calculation**:
\[ \text{Water Needed (ml)} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Calories}}{200} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Water Needed (ml)} = \left( \frac{1600}{200} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Water Needed (ml)} = 8 \times 100 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of jelly beans in each color based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) be the number of blue jelly beans.
   Let \( R \) be the number of red jelly beans.
   Let \( G \) be the number of green jelly beans.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Conditions:**
   - The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans: 
     \[
     R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
     \]
   - The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans:
     \[
     G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
     \]

3. **Total Number of Jelly Beans Equation:**
   The total number of jelly beans is 4500:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]

4. **Substitute the Expressions for Red and Green Jelly Beans into the Total Equation:**
   Substitute \( R = 0.99B \) and \( G = 1.01B \):
   \[
   0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   (0.99 + 1.01 + 1)B = 4500

                    ? Jared is trying to increase his ? typing speed. : He starts with ; 47 words ! per minute (WPM). After some lessons the ; next . time ; he ? tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 : WPM. : If he continues : to increase his typing ! speed ; once more by 5 words, what will ? be : the average of the three measurements?

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increase in typing speed from the initial measurement.
2. Add that increase to the second measurement to get the third measurement.
3. Find the average of the three measurements.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Increase in typing speed
Jared initially types at 47 WPM. After some lessons, he increases his typing speed to 52 WPM.

Increase = Final speed - Initial speed
         = 52 WPM - 47 WPM
         = 5 WPM

So, the increase in typing speed is 5 WPM.

### Step 2: Third measurement
Now, let's calculate the third measurement after adding the increase to the second measurement.

Third measurement = Second measurement + Increase
                  = 52 WPM + 5 WPM
                  = 57 WPM

So, the third measurement is 57 WPM.

### Step 3: Average of the three measurements
Now, we find the average of the three measurements.

Average = (Initial speed + Second measurement + Third measurement) / 3
        = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3
        = (156 WPM) / 3
        = 52 WPM

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

Therefore, the final answer is: The average of the three measurements is \boxed{52} WPM.<|im_end|>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.

To determine the difference in Martin's weight after 5 weeks based on the given information, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly change in weight from eating Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week = 1.25 pounds

2. **Calculate the total weight loss over 5 weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight loss} = \text{Weekly weight loss} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight loss} = 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly change in weight from eating donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week = 1.75 pounds

4. **Calculate the total weight gain over 5 weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight gain} = \text{Weekly weight gain} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight gain} = 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine the difference in weight changes between the two breakfast options:**
   \[
   \text{Difference in weight changes} = \text{Total weight gain (donuts)} - \text{Total weight loss (Cheerios)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference in weight changes} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The difference in Martin’s weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options will be 2.50 pounds.<|im_end|>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many invitations were sent out and subsequently determine how many people will actually attend based on those invitations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Invitation Count:**
   - Alex sends out 100 emails inviting people.
   
2. **Invitations from Invited People:**
   - Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 more friends.
     \[
     100 \text{ (initial invitations)} \times 2 = 200 \text{ additional invitations}
     \]

3. **Total Invitations Sent Out:**
   - Add the initial invitations to the extra invitations:
     \[
     100 + 200 = 300 \text{ total invitations}
     \]

4. **Friends Inviting Friends:**
   - Alex calls in 10 of these friends.
   - Each of these 10 friends invites another friend.
     \[
     10 \text{ friends} \times 1 \text{ friend per invitation} = 10 \text{ additional invitations}
     \]

5. **Total Number of Invitations After Calling:**
   - Add the new invitations made by calling friends to the previous count:
     \[
     300 \text{ initial invitations} + 10 \text{ new invitations} = 310 \text{ total invitations}
     \]

6. **Spouses Invited:**
   - Of the 310 invitations, 8 of them say they will bring their spouse.
     \[
     310 \text{ total invitations} \times 8 = 2480 \text{ invitations including spouses}
     \]

7. **Calculating Total Number of People Who Will Attend:**
   - The number of people who will attend is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{2480}{3} = 826.67 \approx 827 \text{ people (rounding up)}
     \]
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a person, Alex needs at least 827 seats.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{827}

Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.
Including her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.

To determine how much more expensive the boots would be on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for both websites.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at Amazon.com
- Price of the boots: $16
- Shipping cost: $4

Total cost at Amazon.com = Price + Shipping
= $16 + $4
= $20

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at eBay
- Price of the boots: $13
- Shipping cost at eBay = 2 * Shipping cost at Amazon (since shipping costs twice as much)
- Since the shipping cost at Amazon is $4, the shipping cost at eBay will be:
Shipping cost at eBay = 2 * $4
= $8

Total cost at eBay = Price + Shipping
= $13 + $8
= $21

### Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon
Difference in cost = Total cost at eBay - Total cost at Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

### Final Answer
The boots would be $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon. {The final answer is} $1.<|im_end|>","The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days it takes for the beanstalk to reach a height that exceeds the height of Mark's window (which is 20 feet). Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
2. **Height Doubling Each Day**:
   - Day 1: The height doubles from 4 feet to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
   - Day 2: The height doubles again from 8 feet to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
   - Day 3: The height doubles once more from 16 feet to \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet.

At the end of Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is already greater than the 20-foot height of Mark's window. Therefore, it only needs one more day to reach or exceed the height of Mark's window.

3. **Conclusion**: It takes 3 days for the beanstalk to reach a height that exceeds Mark's window.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 3 days.<|im_end|>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet

To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the amount of protein in one mushroom.
- Given that 3 grams of protein are in 100 grams of mushrooms.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of protein in 200 grams of mushrooms.
- Since there are 3 grams of protein in 100 grams of mushrooms, we can set up a proportion to find out how much protein is in 200 grams:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams}}{100 \text{ grams}} = \frac{x \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ grams}} \]
Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = \frac{3 \times 200}{100} = 6 \text{ grams} \]

So, John consumes 6 grams of protein from 200 grams of mushrooms.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of days in a week.
- There are 7 days in a week.

Step 4: Determine how many weeks there are in a month (assuming an average of 4 weeks).
- Let's assume there are 4 weeks in a month for simplicity.

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of protein John gets in a week.
- We already know that John consumes 6 grams of protein daily. So, over 4 weeks:
\[ \text{Total protein in a week} = 6 \text{ grams/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \]

Step 6: Perform the multiplication:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, John gets 24 grams of protein per week.

Final Answer: The final answer is \(\boxed{24}\) grams of protein per week.<|im_end|>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age.

2. **Set Up the Equation Based on the Given Information:**
   According to the statement ""Jerry, is twice as old as he was 5 years ago,"" we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2(J - 5)
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Distribute the 2 on the right side:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   Rearrange terms to isolate \( J \):
   \[
   J - 2J = -10

   Simplify further:
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   Multiply both sides by -1:
   \[
   J = 10

4. **Determine Jerry's Current Age:**
   From our calculation above, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

5. **Calculate Jerry’s Age in 3 Years:**
   Add 3 years to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many hours George needs to work before he can afford the dental work, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of one implant including its crown:**
   - Base cost of one implant: $2000
   - Cost of adding a crown: $500
   - Total cost for one implant including the crown: 
     \[
     2000 + 500 = 2500
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost for two implants (one without a crown and one with a crown):**
   - Cost for one implant (without crown):
     \[
     2000
     \]
   - Cost for the other implant (with crown):
     \[
     2500
     \]
   - Total cost for both implants:
     \[
     2000 + 2500 = 4500
     \]

3. **Add in the deposit George has already paid:**
   - Deposit: $600
   - Total amount George currently has:
     \[
     4500 + 600 = 5100
     \]

4. **Subtract the current balance from the total cost to find out how much more money George needs:**
   - Remaining amount needed:
     \[
     4500
     \]

5. **Divide this remaining amount by George's hourly wage to find out how many hours he needs to work:**
   - Hourly wage: $15
   - Number of hours needed to work:
     \[
     \frac{4500}{15} = 300

                    question:
                    The three angles in a triangle ; add up to 180 degrees. ! One angle is , twice the ; smallest angle, and . one ? angle is three : times the smallest angle. What is the measure ! of ; the largest angle . in the . triangle, in ? degrees?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measures of all three angles in the triangle. Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \). According to the problem:

1. **Smallest Angle**: \( x \)
2. **One Angle**: Twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \).
3. **Other Angle**: Three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \).

Since these angles must sum up to 180 degrees (the total for any triangle), we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180^\circ \]

Let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ x(1 + 2 + 3) = 180^\circ \]
\[ x \cdot 6 = 180^\circ \]
\[ x = \frac{180^\circ}{6} \]
\[ x = 30^\circ \]

Now that we know \( x \), which represents the smallest angle, let's find the other two angles:

- Smallest angle: \( x = 30^\circ \)
- Other angle: \( 2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \)
- Largest angle: \( 3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ \)

Therefore, the measures of the angles in the triangle are:

- Smallest angle: \( 30^\circ \)
- Other angle: \( 60^\circ \)
- Largest angle: \( 90^\circ \)

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{90^\circ}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
x+2x+3x=180

                    question:
                    . Colby wants to buy some : gumballs that cost a nickel each. ? If : he has 8 . quarters, . 6 dimes, 14 nickels, . and ; 15 pennies, how many can he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Colby has.
Colby has three types of coins: quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

- **Quarters**: Each quarter is worth $0.25.
  \[
  8 \text{ quarters} \times \$0.25 = \$2.00
  \]

- **Dimes**: Each dime is worth $0.10.
  \[
  6 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10 = \$0.60
  \]

- **Nickels**: Each nickel is worth $0.05.
  \[
  14 \text{ nickels} \times \$0.05 = \$0.70
  \]

- **Pennies**: Each penny is worth $0.01.
  \[
  15 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01 = \$0.15
  \]

Now, sum up all the amounts to find the total money Colby has:
\[
\$2.00 + \$0.60 + \$0.70 + \$0.15 = \$3.45
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many gumballs Colby can buy.
Each gumball costs $0.05 (since it's a nickel).

We divide the total amount of money by the cost per gumball:
\[
\frac{\$3.45}{\$0.05} = 69
\]

Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs with his current amount of money.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\boxed{69}<|im_end|>","He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.
He has $.6 in dimes because 6 times .1 equals <<6*.1=.6>>.6

He has $.15 in pennies because 15 times .01 equals <<15*.01=.15>>.15
He has $3.65 because 2 plus .6 plus .7 plus .15 equals $<<2+.6+.7+.15=3.45>>3.45
He can buy 69 gum balls because 3.65 divided by .05 equals 69

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the number of animals in each category.
- Dogs: 5
- Cats: 2
- Birds: 10

### Step 2: Determine how many legs each type of animal has.
- Dogs: Each dog has 4 legs.
- Cats: Each cat has 4 legs.
- Birds: Each bird has 2 legs.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal.
- For dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

### Step 4: Sum up all the legs to find the total number of legs for all pets.
\[
\text{Total legs} = 20 \text{ (dogs)} + 8 \text{ (cats)} + 20 \text{ (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the initial weight Jamaal was using:**
   - The problem states that Jamaal used an 8-pound weight initially.
   
2. **Calculate the new weight after increasing by 50%:**
   - Increase = 8 pounds * 50% = 4 pounds
   - New weight = Initial weight + Increase = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds
   
3. **Adjust for the second increase (2 pounds lighter):**
   - Decrease = 2 pounds
   - Final weight = New weight - Decrease = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds
   
Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

**Final Answer:** The final weight Jamaal uses is 10 pounds.<|im_end|>","An increase of 50% of 8 is 1.5*8=12.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Steve receives a console and 5 games on his birthday.
   - He spends $X per month on one game over the first year (12 months).

2. **First Year Calculation:**
   - After one year, he will have bought 12 games at $X each.

3. **Second Year Calculation:**
   - In the second year, he starts buying 2 games per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so he will buy \(12 \times 2 = 24\) games.
   - The total cost for these 24 games would be \(24 \times X\).

4. **Third Year Calculation:**
   - In the third year, he continues buying 2 games per month.
   - Again, there are 12 months in a year, so he will buy another \(12 \times 2 = 24\) games.
   - The total cost for these 24 games would be \(24 \times X\).

5. **Fourth Year Calculation:**
   - In the fourth year, he starts buying 4 games per month instead of 2.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so he will buy \(12 \times 4 = 48\) games.
   - The total cost for these 48 games would be \(48 \times X\).

6. **Total Cost Over Three Years:**
   - The total amount spent on games over three years can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 12X + 24X + 48X = 84X
     \]

7. **Calculating Total Games Purchased:**
   - We know that he received 5 games initially, so we need to add those to the total number of games he purchases over the three years.
   - From the above calculation, the total number of games purchased over three years is:
     \[
     \text{Total Games Purchased} = 84X + 5
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 89 games.<|im_end|>","Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games

Steve then buys 4 games per month for a year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*4=<<4*12=48>>48 games
Steve also gets 5 games for Christmas each year for three years, for another 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 games.
In total over three years, Steve gets 12+24+48+15=<<12+24+48+15=99>>99 games

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for a plane to travel an additional distance given its speed.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Plane's Speed:**
   - The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}

2. **Determine the Total Distance the Plane Will Travel at This Speed:**
   - We want to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed.
   - Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much chocolates Ruiz makes per hour.

Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes per hour, we divide his total production by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much chocolates Marissa makes per hour.

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates per hour as Ruiz does. So, we multiply Ruiz’s hourly rate by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how long Marissa works in one day.

If they work for 12 hours in a day, then Marissa will also work for 12 hours because she has already determined her hourly rate.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of chocolates both make in one day.

First, calculate how much chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's daily production} = 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, calculate how much chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Marissa's daily production} = 12 \times 45 = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, add their individual daily productions to get the combined total:

\[
\text{Total daily production} = 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolates they make together in one day is **1260 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
If they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while
Marissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate

2. Calculate the amount Howard spends on Wednesday.
3. Sum up all his spending over the three days.
4. Subtract the total spending from his original amount to find out how much he has left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount Howard spends on Tuesday
Howard spends twice as much on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he spent $8 on Monday, he will spend:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount Howard spends on Wednesday
On Wednesday, Howard spends four times as much as he did on Tuesday. Since he spent $16 on Tuesday, he will spend:

### Step 3: Sum up all his spending over the three days
Total spending over the three days is:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total spending from his original amount
Howard originally had $100. After spending $88, he has:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Howard has left is \(12\) dollars.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Patrick earned over the total time period. We'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 15
- **Price per cup**: $0.50
- **Time period**: 4 hours

First, find the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
\[ \text{Total cups sold} = 15 \times 4 \]

Next, calculate the total revenue for these 4 hours:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Total cups sold} \times \text{Price per cup} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = (15 \times 4) \times 0.50 \]

Now let's do the calculation:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \]
\[ 60 \times 0.50 = 30 \]

So, Patrick earned $30 from selling lemonade for the first 4 hours.

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 10
- **Price per cup**: $0.60
- **Time period**: 2 hours

Calculate the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours:
\[ \text{Total cups sold} = 10 \times 2 \]

Then, calculate the total revenue for these 2 hours:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Total cups sold} \times \text{Price per cup} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = (10 \times 2) \times 0.60 \]

Now let's do the calculation:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \]

So, Patrick earned $12 from selling lemonade for the next 2 hours.

### Step 3: Add both amounts together
Finally, add the revenues from both periods to get the total amount earned:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$30 + \$12 \]

Now let's do the addition:
\[ 30 + 12 = 42 \]

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \( \boxed{42} \) dollars from selling lemonade for 6 hours.<|im_end|>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.

He earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.
So for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
Therefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

                    question:
                    Every 2 miles a , car ; drives the tires rotate 725 times. ;  Jeremy ; drives 400 miles : a month. !  If , each tire can : undergo ! 10,440,000 rotations how many years before the tire ? needs to be replaced?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of rotations per mile.
Given that every 2 miles, the car rotates its tires 725 times, we can calculate the number of rotations per mile as follows:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} \]

Let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

So, the car’s tires rotate approximately 362.5 times for every mile driven.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of rotations Jeremy drives in one year.
Jeremy drives 400 miles per month. Therefore, the total number of rotations he makes in one year (which has 12 months) would be:
\[ \text{Total rotations per year} = 362.5 \times 400 \]

Let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Total rotations per year} = 362.5 \times 400 = 145,000 \]

So, Jeremy drives his tires 145,000 times per year.

### Step 3: Determine the lifespan of each tire based on the total rotations it can withstand.
Each tire can withstand up to 10,440,000 rotations.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of years until the tire needs to be replaced.
To find out how long the tire will last before needing replacement, divide the total number of rotations it can withstand by the total number of rotations Jeremy drives in a year:
\[ \text{Years until replacement} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} \]

Let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Years until replacement} = \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} \approx 72 \]

So, the tire will need to be replaced after about 72 years.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the tire will need to be replaced after approximately **72 years**.<|im_end|>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one pump of shampoo given that Jackie uses 1 pump per wash for 120 washes.

Step 1: Determine the total number of pumps used.
Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash and she does 120 washes, the total number of pumps used is:
\[ 1 \text{ pump/wash} \times 120 \text{ washes} = 120 \text{ pumps} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of all the pumps.
We know that the total cost for the shampoo is $24.00. Since the total cost is divided equally among the 120 pumps, the cost per pump is:
\[ \frac{\$24.00}{120 \text{ pumps}} = \$0.20 \text{ per pump} \]

Step 3: Convert the cost from dollars to cents.
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost per pump in cents is:
\[ \$0.20 \text{ per pump} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 20 \text{ cents/pump} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]<|im_end|>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost before tax:**
   - Shirt: $25
   - Shorts: $35
   - Total cost before tax = $25 + $35 = $60

2. **Apply the 30% discount on the total cost:**
   - Discount amount = 30% of $60
   - Discount amount = 0.30 × $60 = $18
   - Total cost after discount = $60 - $18 = $42

3. **Add the sales tax (assuming it's included in the discounted price):**
   - Let's denote the sales tax rate as \( t \).
   - Sales tax amount = \( t \times \$42 \)

4. **Subtract the sales tax from the total cost after discount to get the final amount Joe will pay:**
   - Final amount = Total cost after discount - Sales tax
   - Final amount = $42 - \( t \times \$42 \)

Since the problem does not specify the sales tax rate, we can only express the final amount in terms of the sales tax rate.

**Final Answer:** Joe will have \( \boxed{42} \) dollars left after the purchase, assuming the sales tax is included.<|im_end|>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much butter Juan needs, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of butter needed per day
- Juan starts with making 4 dozen croissons daily.
- Each dozen contains 12 croissons.

First, calculate the total number of croissons made in one day:
\[ \text{Total croissons per day} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Next, determine how many croissons fit into one dozen:
\[ \text{Croissons per dozen} = 12 \]

Now, find out how many dozens of croissons Juan makes in one day:
\[ \text{Dozens per day} = \frac{48}{12} = 4 \]

Since it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissons, we can now calculate the amount of butter needed per day:
\[ \text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ \text{Butter per day} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \]

So, Juan needs **1** pound of butter per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of butter needed for a week
Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the daily requirement by 7:
\[ \text{Butter per week} = 1 \times 7 = 7 \]

Therefore, Juan will need **7 pounds of butter** to make 4 dozen croissons in a week.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 7 pounds of butter}}
\]<|im_end|>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much more it would cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Monica's street.
- The length of Monica's street is 150 meters.
- The cost to repave one meter of street is $194.

First, calculate the total cost for Monica's street:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of Monica's street} \times \text{Cost per meter} \]
\[ \text{Total cost (Monica)} = 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} \]

### Step 2: Perform the multiplication to find the total cost for Monica's street.
\[ 150 \times 194 = 28, 100 \]

So, the total cost to repave Monica's street is $28, 100.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for Lewis' street.
- The length of Lewis' street is 490 meters.
- The cost to repave one meter of street is still $194.

Next, calculate the total cost for Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of Lewis' street} \times \text{Cost per meter} \]
\[ \text{Total cost (Lewis)} = 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} \]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication to find the total cost for Lewis' street.
\[ 490 \times 194 = 96, 760 \]

So, the total cost to repave Lewis' street is $96, 760.

### Step 5: Determine the difference in cost between repaving both streets.
Subtract the total cost for Monica's street from the total cost for Lewis' street:
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = \text{Total cost (Lewis)} - \text{Total cost (Monica)} \]
\[ \text{Difference in cost} = 96, 760 - 28, 100 \]

### Step 6: Perform the subtraction to find the difference in cost.
\[ 96, 760 - 28, 100 = 68, 660 \]

Therefore, it costs **$68, 660** more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.<|im_end|>","Total cost to repave Monica’s street is 194*150 = <<194*150=29100>>29,100 dollars.

To determine how much John's research cost, we need to break down the funding over time and calculate the total amount spent.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months John was funded.
- Initial funding period: 5 months
- Additional funding periods: (10 - 5) * 12 = 5 * 12 = 60 months
- Total months funded: 5 + 60 = 65 months

Step 2: Calculate the monthly funding increase.
- First 5 months: $100,000/month
- Each subsequent month: $100,000/month * 1.5 = $150,000/month

Step 3: Calculate the total funding from the initial 5 months.
- Total funding in the first 5 months: $100,000 * 5 = $500,000

Step 4: Calculate the total funding from the additional months.
- Number of additional months: 60 months
- Funding per additional month: $150,000/month
- Total funding in additional months: ($150,000/12) * 60 = $12,500/month * 60 = $750,000

Step 5: Add the initial funding to the additional funding.
- Total funding: $500,000 (initial) + $750,000 (additional) = $1,250,000

Therefore, John's research cost a total of $1,250,000.<|im_end|>","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by all five players. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total weight of meat eaten by each player:**
   - First player: 6 ounces of steak.
   - Second player: 8 beef tips, each weighing 0.5 ounces (since \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces).
   - Third player: One pound (which is 16 ounces) of steak.
   - Fourth and Fifth players: Vegetarian meals.

2. **Sum up the weights of the meats:**
   - Total weight of meat eaten by the first player: \(6\) ounces.
   - Total weight of meat eaten by the second player: \(4\) ounces.
   - Total weight of meat eaten by the third player: \(16\) ounces.
   - Since the fourth and fifth players had vegetarian meals, they did not consume any meat.

3. **Add up all the weights:**
   - Total ounces of meat consumed = \(6 + 4 + 16 = 26\) ounces.

Therefore, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is **26**.<|im_end|>","The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.

2. Determine how many days March has.
3. Multiply the daily post count by the number of days in March.

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total number of posts made by all members in one day:**
   - Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.
   - There are 1000 members in the group.
   
   So, the total number of posts per day = (number of members) × (average posts per member per day)
   
   Total posts per day = 1000 × 3 = 3000 posts.

2. **Determine how many days March has:**
   - March typically has 31 days.

3. **Multiply the daily post count by the number of days in March:**
   - We already calculated that there are 3000 posts per day.
   - March has 31 days.

   Therefore, the total number of posts in March = (daily posts) × (number of days in March)
   
   Total posts in March = 3000 × 31 = 93,000 posts.

\]
\[

                    question:
                    ! Jane ! planted a beanstalk in her backyard. After the first ? week, ! it was 3 ; inches tall. . It , doubled in height ? the second week. It grew . another 4 , inches in the third . week. How tall was ? the beanstalk after 3 weeks?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial height of the beanstalk.
2. Calculate how much taller it grows during the second week.
3. Calculate how much taller it grows during the third week.
4. Sum up all the growth periods to get the total height.

Step 1: Initial height
- The beanstalk was 3 inches tall at the start.

Step 2: Growth during the second week
- The height doubles from 3 inches to 6 inches.

Step 3: Growth during the third week
- It grows an additional 4 inches.

Step 4: Total height after 3 weeks
- Add the initial height to the height after the second week and then add the height after the third week.

Let's calculate it:

Initial height = 3 inches
Height after the second week = 3 + (3 * 2) = 3 + 6 = 9 inches
Height after the third week = 9 + 4 = 13 inches

Total height after 3 weeks = 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 inches

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 13 inches.<|im_end|>","It was 3 inches tall after the first week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Determine how much meat Prince sells per hour.
Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.

### Step 2: Calculate how much meat Prince sells in a day.
There are 8 hours in a typical workday (assuming an 8-hour work schedule).
So, the total amount of meat sold in a day = \( 15 \text{ kg/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \).

\[
= 120 \text{ kg/day}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much meat Prince needs to sell from Bill’s bull over time.
Bill’s bull weighs 750 kg.

### Step 4: Calculate how long it takes for Prince to sell all the meat from Bill’s bull.
Since Prince sells 120 kg of meat per day, we can find out how many days it will take to sell all 750 kg:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total weight of the bull}}{\text{Daily sales}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{750 \text{ kg}}{120 \text{ kg/day}}
\]

\[
= 6.25 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, it will take Prince **6.25** days to sell all the meat from Bill’s bull.<|im_end|>","In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students were present in the school auditorium based on the given information about seating arrangements and occupancy rates.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats:**
   - There are 4 rows.
   - Each row contains 18 seats.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. **Determine the number of seats occupied by administrators:**
   - Administrators occupy one-fourth of the seats.
   
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of seats remaining after administrators:**
   - Remaining seats after administrators' occupation.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. **Determine the number of seats occupied by parents:**
   - Parents occupy one-third of the remaining seats.
   
   \[
   \text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of seats remaining for students:**
   - Seats left after parents' occupation.
   
   \[
   \text{Seats remaining for students} = 54 - 18 = 36
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the number of students who attended the event is 36.

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of poles:**
   - There are 6 poles at each intersection.
   - The road has 4 intersections.

   So, the total number of poles can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total number of poles} = \text{Number of poles per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total number of poles} = 6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of street lights initially available:**
   - Since each pole has 4 street lights.
   - Therefore, the total number of street lights would be:
     \[
     \text{Total number of street lights} = \text{Total number of poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole}
     \]
   Substituting the previously calculated value for the total number of poles:
   \[
   \text{Total number of street lights} = 24 \times 4 = 96
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of non-working street lights:**
   - Given that 20 streetlights are not working.

   Thus, the total number of working street lights can be found by subtracting the non-working ones from the total number of street lights:
   \[
   \text{Total number of working street lights} = \text{Total number of street lights} - \text{Non-working street lights}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total number of working street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{76}

To determine how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining playtime for each DVD.
- Each DVD can be played 1000 times before breaking.

#### DVD 1:
- Played 356 times.
- Remaining playtime = Total playtime - Played time = 1000 - 356 = **644** times.

#### DVD 2:
- Played 135 times.
- Remaining playtime = Total playtime - Played time = 1000 - 135 = **865** times.

### Step 2: Add the remaining playtimes together.
- Total remaining playtime = Playtime of DVD 1 + Playtime of DVD 2 = 644 + 865 = **1509** times.

To determine the total cost of the physical therapy sessions, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total duration**: John attended physical therapy for 6 weeks.
2. **Frequency**: He went twice every week.
3. **Duration per session**: Each session lasted for 2 hours.

First, calculate the total number of sessions:

\[ \text{Number of sessions} = \text{Duration in weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} \]
\[ \text{Number of sessions} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions} \]

Next, determine the total duration of all sessions:

\[ \text{Total duration} = \text{Number of sessions} \times \text{Duration per session} \]
\[ \text{Total duration} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that each session costs $125. Therefore, to find the total cost, multiply the total number of sessions by the cost per session:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of sessions} \times \text{Cost per session} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times \$125/\text{session} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$1500 \]

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $\$1500$.<|im_end|>","Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully:

1. **Determine how much gum Jim chews per hour:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours.
   
2. **Calculate how much gum Jim eats during the school day:**
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.
   - Since Jim chews 1 piece every 2 hours, in 8 hours he will chew \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) pieces.

3. **Calculate how much gum Jim eats after school:**
   - After school, Jim chews 1 piece on the way home from school.
   - So, after school, he still has \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) pieces left.

4. **Calculate how much gum Jim eats before bedtime:**
   - Before bedtime, Jim chews 1 more piece.
   - So, before bedtime, he has \( 5 + 1 = 6 \) pieces left.

5. **Calculate how much gum Jim gives to his sister:**
   - Jim gives half of what he has left to his sister.
   - Half of 6 pieces is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) pieces.
   - So, he gives away 3 pieces and has \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) pieces left.

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is \( \boxed{3} \).<|im_end|>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum

1. **Convert the given speed from kb/s to Mb/h**.
2. **Calculate the total time for one hour**.
3. **Divide the total data transferred in Mb/h by the time in hours**.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Convert the given speed from kb/s to Mb/h

Given:
- Internet speed = 20 kbps (kilobits per second)
- We need to convert it to Mbps (megabits per second)

First, let's convert kilobytes to megabytes. Since there are 1000 bytes in a kilobyte and 8 bits in a byte, 1 kilobyte is equal to \(1 \times 1000 / 8\) bytes, which simplifies to \(125\) bytes.

So, \(20 kbps\) can be converted as follows:
\[ 20 \text{ kbps} = 20 \times 125 \text{ bytes/second} = 2500 \text{ bytes/second} \]

Next, convert bytes per second to bytes per minute:
\[ 2500 \text{ bytes/second} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 150000 \text{ bytes/minute} \]

Then, convert bytes per minute to bytes per hour:
\[ 150000 \text{ bytes/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 9000000 \text{ bytes/hour} \]

Finally, convert bytes per hour to megabytes per hour:
\[ 9000000 \text{ bytes/hour} \div (1000 \text{ bytes/Mb}) = 9000 \text{ MB/hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for one hour

We already calculated the total amount of data transferred in MB per hour, which is \(9000 \text{ MB/hour}\).

### Step 3: Divide the total data transferred in MB/h by the time in hours

Now, divide the total data transferred in MB/h by the time in hours:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ MB}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 9000 \text{ MB/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is \(9000 \text{ MB/hour}\). 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9000}
\]<|im_end|>","With a speed of 20 kb per second, there are 20*60 = <<20*60=1200>>1200 kb per minute.
As 1Mb has 1000kb, the converted speed is 1200/1000=<<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2Mb per minute.
So, Ashley’s internet connection speed is 1.2*60 = <<1.2*60=72>>72Mb per hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the total number of cars towed over the entire week.

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The problem states that on the first three days, the truck pulled 10 cars per day.
   - Total cars pulled in these three days = \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

2. **Remaining Days (Total Days - First Three Days):**
   - The total number of days in a week is 7.
   - Subtracting the first three days from seven gives us 4 remaining days.
   - On each of the remaining four days, the truck pulled 4 fewer cars than on any of the first three days.

   Let's determine how many cars were pulled on each of these remaining days.
   - Cars pulled on the fourth day = \(10 - 4 = 6\).
   - Cars pulled on the fifth day = \(10 - 4 = 6\).
   - Cars pulled on the sixth day = \(10 - 4 = 6\).
   - Cars pulled on the seventh day = \(10 - 4 = 6\).

   So, the total number of cars pulled on the remaining four days is:
   - \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Cars Towed:**
   - Add the number of cars pulled in the first three days to the number of cars pulled on the remaining four days.
   - Total cars pulled = \(30 + 24 = 54\).

Therefore, the total number of cars towed that week is {The final answer is} 54.<|im_end|>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Adam's current height in inches:**
   Adam's current height is given as 40 inches.

2. **Calculate the difference between his desired height (4 feet) and his current height (40 inches):**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet = \(4 \times 12\) inches.
   - Therefore, 4 feet = 48 inches.

3. **Find out how much taller Adam needs to be than his current height:**
   - The difference is \(48\) inches (desired height) - \(40\) inches (current height).

4. **Calculate the number of years it takes for him to grow that amount based on his annual growth rate:**
   - He grows 2 inches per year.

Now let's perform the calculations:

1. Current height in inches: \(40\)
   
2. Desired height in inches: \(48\) inches
   
3. Height difference: \(48 - 40 = 8\) inches
   
4. Number of years needed to grow 8 inches: 
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam **4 years** to reach the required height of 4 feet, which is sufficient to ride the roller coaster. 

Hence, the final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\).<|im_end|>","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars**

James sells 10 cars at $25,000 each.

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$250,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount the company pays for each car**

The company pays 30% of the original price (cost) to acquire the cars.

\[ \text{Company's Payment per Car} = 0.30 \times \$25,000 \]

\[ \text{Company's Payment per Car} = \$7,500 \]

Since James sells 10 cars:

\[ \text{Total Company Payments} = 10 \times \$7,500 \]

\[ \text{Total Company Payments} = \$75,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit made by James**

Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Company Payments.

\[ \text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$175,000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate James' commission**

James earns a 10% commission on the profit.

\[ \text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 \]

\[ \text{Commission} = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, James makes a total of **$17,500** in his commission after considering both the profit from selling the cars and the payment from the company.<|im_end|>","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of surfers who stay upright:**
   - We know that out of every 100 surfers, only 25% can stay upright.
   - Therefore, the number of surfers who can stay upright = \( \frac{25}{100} \times 100 = 25 \).

2. **Determine the number of women among those who stay upright:**
   - Out of the 25 surfers who can stay upright, 60% are women.
   - Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright = \( \frac{60}{100} \times 25 = 15 \).

3. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - Since we have already determined that 25 surfers can stay upright in total, and knowing that 15 of them are women, the remaining surfers must be men.
   - Number of men who can stay upright = Total surfers who can stay upright - Women who can stay upright = \( 25 - 15 = 10 \).

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   - We know that the price of the gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of the diamond jewel.
   - Let the price of the diamond jewel be \( D \).
   - Given \( D = \$2000 \).

   So,
   \[
   \text{Price of the gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times D = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
   \]

2. **Calculate the price of the silver jewel:**
   - The price of the silver jewel is given to be $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
   - Therefore, the price of the silver jewel is:
   \[
   \text{Price of the silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

3. **Sum up the prices of all three jewels:**
   - Now we have the prices of the gold, diamond, and silver jewels.
   - Total price for all three jewels is:
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 1600 + 2000 + 1200 = 4800

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is \( \boxed{4800} \).<|im_end|>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\$60}{10 \text{ classes}} = \$6 \text{ per class} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the maximum number of classes Manny can afford at $10 per class**
If Manny's classes exceed $10 per class, his parents will not sign him up again. So, we need to find out how many classes he can afford without exceeding $10 per class.

\[ \text{Maximum number of classes at } \$10 \text{ per class} = \frac{\$60}{\$10 \text{ per class}} = 6 \text{ classes} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many classes Manny has already taken**
Manny has already taken 10 classes.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again**
Since Manny has already paid for all 10 classes (at $6 per class), he cannot afford any additional classes under the condition set by his parents.

   - In one week (7 days), she will process \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.

5. **Combine their weekly operations:**
   - To find the total weekly production, we add Julie's and Jewel's weekly operations together.
   - Total weekly production = \(14 + 350\).

6. **Perform the addition:**
   - \(14 + 350 = 364\).

### Conclusion:
The total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel combined is 364 instances of processing customers.<|im_end|>","While Jewel is processing 50 orders in a day, Julie processes 50 orders/day * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 orders/day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the price per apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
     \[
     \text{Price per apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4} = \$1.30
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for five apples:**
   - The price of one apple is $1.30.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50
     \]

3. **Determine the price per orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
     \[
     \text{Price per orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for five oranges:**
   - The price of one orange is $1.10.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50
     \]

5. **Add the costs together to find the total amount Clyde will pay:**
   - Total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50 = \$12.00
     \]

### Conclusion:
Clyde will pay a total of $\boxed{12.00}$ for 5 apples and 5 oranges.<|im_end|>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Bob wants to dig a hole . 6 feet long by 4 ! feet ; wide by 3 ? feet deep. : If it takes : him 3 seconds to shovel a , cubic ? foot ? of earth, how long : will it take : him to dig : the hole?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the hole:**
   - The dimensions given for the hole are length (L), width (W), and depth (D).
   - We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism: 
     \[
     V = L \times W \times D
     \]
   
2. **Plug in the values:**
   - Length (L) = 6 feet
   - Width (W) = 4 feet
   - Depth (D) = 3 feet
   
   So,
   \[
   V = 6 \text{ ft} \times 4 \text{ ft} \times 3 \text{ ft}
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   V = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

4. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to cubic yards:**
   - Since there are 3 feet in a yard, we convert cubic feet to cubic yards using the conversion factor \( \frac{1}{27} \):
     \[
     V_{\text{cubic yards}} = \frac{V_{\text{cubic feet}}}{27}
     \]
     Substituting the value of \( V \):
     \[
     V_{\text{cubic yards}} = \frac{72}{27} = 2.6667 \text{ cubic yards}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time required to shovel the earth:**
   - It takes 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot.
   - Therefore, to find out how many seconds it takes to shovel 2.6667 cubic yards, we first need to determine how many cubic feet are in 2.6667 cubic yards.
     - There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard, so:
       \[
       \text{Cubic feet in 2.6667 cubic yards} = 2.6667 \times 27 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
       \]
     - Now, since it takes 3 seconds per cubic foot, the total time taken is:
       \[
       \text{Time (seconds)} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds}
       \]

Therefore, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is **216 seconds**.<|im_end|>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.

To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the additional costs for each feature he wants to add and then sum them up along with the base price.

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Base Price**: 
   - The base price of the truck is given as $30,000.

2. **King Cab Upgrade**:
   - The King Cab upgrade adds an extra $7,500.
   
3. **Towing Package**:
   - This feature comes at no extra cost.

4. **Leather Seats**:
   - Leather seats are priced as one-third the cost of the King Cab upgrade.
   - Since the King Cab upgrade is $7,500, the leather seats will be priced as $\frac{7,500}{3} = \$2,500$.

5. **Running Boards**:
   - Running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats.
   - Therefore, the running boards will be priced as $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

6. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**:
   - The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now let's sum all these values together:

- Base price: $30,000
- King Cab upgrade: $7,500
- Towing package: $0 (no extra cost)
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Total Cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $0 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $53,500.

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $53,500.<|im_end|>","The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Tim will earn in a year after receiving both the raise and the bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary after the raise:**
   - Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000.
   - He receives a 5% raise.
   - The amount of the raise = \( 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \).
   - New monthly salary = Current salary + Raise = \( 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \).

2. **Calculate the monthly bonus:**
   - The bonus is given as half the previous month's salary.
   - Previous month's salary = $20,000.
   - Monthly bonus = \( \frac{20,000}{2} = 10,000 \).

3. **Calculate the total monthly earnings including the raise and bonus:**
   - Total monthly earnings = New salary + Bonus = \( 21,000 + 10,000 = 31,000 \).

4. **Calculate the annual earnings:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Annual earnings = Total monthly earnings \(\times\) 12 = \( 31,000 \times 12 = 372,000 \).

So, Tim's total earnings for the year will be $\boxed{372,000}$.<|im_end|>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000

1. **Calculate the total number of items bought:**
   - Suits: 10
   - Dress pants: 10
   - Dress shirts (per suit): 3
   Total = 10 suits + 10 dress pants + 10 suits × 3 dress shirts/suit
         = 10 + 10 + (10 × 3)
         = 20 + 30
         = 50 items

2. **Calculate the cost of the suits:**
   - Cost per suit: $750
   Number of suits: 10
   Total cost for suits = 10 suits × $750/suit
                      = $7500

3. **Calculate the cost of the dress pants:**
   - Cost per pair of pants: $750 / 5 = $150
   Number of pairs of pants: 10
   Total cost for pants = 10 pairs × $150/pair
                       = $1500

4. **Calculate the total cost of the suits and pants combined:**
   Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of pants

              = $9000

5. **Calculate the cost of one dress shirt:**
   - Cost per shirt: $60
   Number of shirts per suit: 3
   Total cost per shirt = 3 shirts × $60/shirt
                        = $180

6. **Calculate the total cost of all the dress shirts:**
   Total cost for all shirts = 10 suits × $180/shirt
                            = $1800

7. **Calculate the total cost of everything:**
   Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of pants + Cost of all shirts
              = $9000 + $1500 + $1800

6. **Relate the total weight of the flour to the number of bags:**
   - If the total weight of the flour is known, say \( W \), then:
     \[
     W = n \times \text{(weight per bag)}
     \]
   - We would need to divide \( W \) by the weight of one portion to find \( n \).

7. **Calculate the total amount of flour if we had the number of bags:**
   - Once we know \( n \), the total amount of flour can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total flour} = n \times 2 \text{ kg}
     \]

Since the problem does not provide the total weight of the flour, we cannot proceed further without additional information.

**Final Answer:**  
The final answer is incomplete because we do not have enough information to determine the total weight of the flour or the number of bags. Therefore, we cannot calculate the total amount of flour in terms of the number of bags.<|im_end|>","A bag of flour has 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 kilograms.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then sum those distances.

**Step 1: Calculate Alisa's distance**
- Alisa's speed = 12 miles/hour
- Time Alisa spent biking = 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

Alisa's distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Alisa} = 12 \times 4.5

\[
\text{Distance}_{Alisa} = 54 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Stanley's distance**
- Stanley's speed = 10 miles/hour
- Time Stanley spent biking = 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

Stanley's distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Stanley} = 10 \times 2.5
\]

\[
\text{Distance}_{Stanley} = 25 \text{ miles}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the task into two parts: digging through soil and then digging through clay.

1. **Determine the time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - The total length of soil to be dug is 24 feet.
   
   To find out how many hours it takes to dig 24 feet of soil, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs faster through clay than through soil.
   - His speed through clay is half that of soil, so his speed through clay is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) feet per hour.
   - The total length of clay to be dug is 8 feet.
   
   Using the same formula as before:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time required:**
   - Add the time spent digging through soil to the time spent digging through clay.
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 6 \text{ hours (soil)} + 4 \text{ hours (clay)} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Bill a total of 10 hours to dig the well. {The final answer is} 10 hours.<|im_end|>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour

Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many cupcakes Howie needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of cupcakes required based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of students in the class:**
   Let’s assume there are \( n \) students in the class.

2. **Calculate the total number of people who would like cupcakes (including Howie):**
   - There are \( n \) students.
   - Including Howie himself, that makes \( n + 1 \) people who might want cupcakes.

3. **Assess the preferences of these people:**
   - Half of them prefer vanilla, half prefer chocolate.
   - Therefore, approximately \( \frac{n}{2} \) people will choose vanilla, and \( \frac{n}{2} \) will choose chocolate.

4. **Calculate the number of vanilla cupcakes needed:**
   - Since half of the \( n + 1 \) people prefer vanilla, Howie needs to buy at least \( \frac{n}{2} \) vanilla cupcakes to cater to those who prefer vanilla.

5. **Calculate the number of chocolate cupcakes needed:**
   - Similarly, since half of the \( n + 1 \) people prefer chocolate, Howie also needs to buy at least \( \frac{n}{2} \) chocolate cupcakes to cater to those who prefer chocolate.

6. **Sum up all the cupcakes needed:**
   - The total number of cupcakes Howie needs to buy is the sum of the vanilla and chocolate cupcakes.
   \[
   \text{Total cupcakes} = \frac{n}{2} (\text{vanilla}) + \frac{n}{2} (\text{chocolate})
   \]
   Simplifying this expression gives:
   \[
   \text{Total cupcakes} = \frac{n}{2} \left( \frac{\text{total}}{2} \right)
   \]

7. **Given information about Howie’s specific requirements:**
   - Howie buys the same amount of cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and his classmates. This means he buys 2 cupcakes per person.
   - There are 25 classmates, including Howie and his teacher.

8. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes for the whole group:**
   - Each of the 26 people (Howie, his teacher, and the 25 classmates) will receive 2 cupcakes.
   \[
   \text{Total cupcakes} = 26 \times 2 = 52
   \]

9. **Conclusion:**
   - To ensure everyone has their preferred type of cupcake and Howie can meet his own requirement, Howie should buy 52 cupcakes in total.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: Howie should buy 52 cupcakes.<|im_end|>","Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.
He wants to get 2 cupcakes for everyone, so 27 people x 2 cupcakes each = <<27*2=54>>54 cupcakes that Howie should buy.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

**Step 1: Determine the number of likes after 3 weeks**

Given that three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number:

- Let \( L_0 \) be the initial number of likes.
- The number of likes after 3 weeks (\( L_3 \)) is given as 70 times \( L_0 \).

\[ L_3 = 70 \times L_0 \]

We know from the problem statement that \( L_3 = 7000 \):

\[ 7000 = 70 \times L_0 \]

Solving for \( L_0 \):

\[ L_0 = \frac{7000}{70} \]
\[ L_0 = 100 \]

So, initially, Fishio had 100 likes.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of likes including the recent increase**

Fishio received 20000 more likes recently. 

Therefore, the total number of likes (including the recent increase) will be:

\[ Total\ Likes = Initial\ Likes + Recent\ Increase \]

\[ Total\ Likes = 100 + 20000 \]
\[ Total\ Likes = 20100 \]

**Final Answer:** 
The final number of likes on Fishio's post is **20100**.<|im_end|>","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.
The total number of likes in the four weeks is 140000+2000 = <<140000+2000=142000>>142000
If Fishio received 20000 more likes recently, the number of likes on the photo is 142000+20000=<<142000+20000=162000>>162000

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the final price Clara and Sheila pay for their pomegranates over the two days and then find the difference between these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Clara's Final Price

**Initial Purchase:**
- Number of pomegranates: 20
- Cost per pomegranate: $20
- Total initial cost: \( 20 \times 20 = $400 \)

**Discount Applied:**
- Discount applied: $2
- Net amount after discount: \( 400 - 2 = $398 \)

So, Clara pays $398 in total.

### Step 2: Calculate Sheila's Final Price

**Initial Purchase:**
- Number of pomegranates: 20
- New cost per pomegranate: $30
- Total initial cost: \( 20 \times 30 = $600 \)

**Applying the 10% Discount:**
- Discount rate: 10%
- Discounted total: \( 600 \times (1 - 0.1) = 600 \times 0.9 = $540 \)

So, Sheila pays $540 in total.

### Step 3: Find the Difference Between Their Final Prices

Difference: \( |398 - 540| = $142 \)

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $\boxed{142}$.<|im_end|>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total sales for one month:**
   - Ariadne's sales from red hats = $400.
   - Sales from green hats = half of red hat sales.

2. **Calculate the sales from green hats:**
   \[
   \text{Sales from green hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = \$200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sales for one month:**
   \[
   \text{Total sales per month} = \$400 (\text{red}) + \$200 (\text{green}) = \$600
   \]

4. **Determine the total sales for two months:**
   - The second month sales are \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the first month's sales.
   \[
   \text{Second month sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times \$600 = \$450
   \]
   - Total sales over two months:
   \[
   \text{Total sales (two months)} = \$400 (\text{first month}) + \$450 (\text{second month}) = \$850
   \]

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $\boxed{\$850}$.

Now let's verify this step-by-step solution:

1. Red hats' sales = $400.
2. Green hats' sales = Half of red hat sales = $200.
3. Total sales per month = $400 (red) + $200 (green) = $600.
4. Second month sales = \( \frac{3}{4} \times \$600 = \$450 \).
5. Total sales (two months) = $400 (first month) + $450 (second month) = $850.

This matches our calculation, so the final answer is confirmed as $\boxed{\$850}$.<|im_end|>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.

To determine how much James pays for the carriage ride, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total duration of the ride.
2. Determine the number of hours spent on the ride.
3. Apply the given pricing structure (first hour at $15, subsequent hours at double the previous rate).
4. Sum up the costs.

Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the ride.
- The ride starts at 5 PM and ends at 9 PM.
- Duration = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

Step 2: Determine the number of hours spent on the ride.
- Since there is no discount or fee mentioned for being early, all 4 hours will be charged.

Step 3: Apply the pricing structure.
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one.

Let's calculate the cost for each hour:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $15 * 2 = $30
- Third hour: $30 * 2 = $60
- Fourth hour: $60 * 2 = $120

Now, sum up the costs:
Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 + $120 = $225

   - At the beginning of the week, Sally's bank account had $200.

2. **Final Amount in Bank Account:**
   - After receiving her wages for the week, her bank account now has $420.

3. **Calculate Total Wage Earned:**
   - To find out how much Sally earned during the week, we need to subtract the initial amount from the final amount.
     \[
     \text{Total Wages Earned} = \text{Final Amount} - \text{Initial Amount}

4. **Determine Weekly Wage:**
   - We know that Sally's total earnings over the week should equal her weekly wage of $300.

5. **Calculate Withheld Amount:**
   - The difference between what Sally actually earned ($220) and what she should have earned ($300) will indicate how much was withheld.
     \[
     \text{Withheld Amount} = \text{Weekly Wage} - \text{Actual Earnings}

To determine how many dozen eggs Lori needs, let's break this down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of deviled egg halves Lori needs for herself.
Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.

- Number of eggs needed per guest (including herself): \( \frac{1}{2} \) eggs/guest

Since there are 16 guests, including herself, we calculate:
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ eggs/guest} = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

So, Lori needs **8 eggs** in total.

Each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed for all guests.
\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves/guest} = 48 \text{ halves} \]

### Step 4: Convert the number of halves to eggs.
Since one whole egg makes 2 halves, we can convert the number of halves to eggs as follows:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves/egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of eggs needed if they were sold by the dozen.
Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen} \]

Therefore, Lori needs **2 dozen eggs**.<|im_end|>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves
1 whole egg is needed to make 2 halves so 48 halves is 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 whole eggs
1 dozen is equal to 12 and she needs 24 eggs so she needs 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 dozen eggs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pages Sheila needs to write:**
   - The total number of pages in the research paper is 15.

2. **Calculate how many pages Sheila has already written:**
   - According to the information given, she has completed \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the paper.
   
   To find out how many pages that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pages already written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. **Subtract the pages already written from the total number of pages:**
   - Subtracting the 5 pages she has already written from the total 15 pages gives us:
   \[
   \text{Pages left to write} = 15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pages she still needs to write is 10 pages.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 10 pages.<|im_end|>","Shiela has already written one third of the paper which is 15 pages x 1/3 = <<15*1/3=5>>5 pages.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of pages in the book**
- Total number of pages = 200

**Step 2: Calculate how many pages Mike reads per day**
- Pages per day = 10

**Step 3: Determine how many days Mike has to complete the reading**
- Days available = 30

**Step 4: Calculate how many days Mike can actually read given the daily limit**
- Since Mike can only read for 30 days and he plans to read 10 pages per day, we need to find out if he can fit all 200 pages into those 30 days.
  
    - Number of days required to read all 200 pages = \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) days.

Since Mike wants to finish on time (within 30 days), he cannot read enough pages to meet the deadline because he would only be able to read for 20 days at most.

Therefore, **Mike will not be able to finish the reading within the given period**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much James spent on getting and maintaining his plane over one year, we need to break down the costs into components and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. **Cost of Renting the Hangar**
   - James pays $5,000 per month for hangar rental.
   - For one year (12 months), this would be:
     \[
     5,000 \times 12 = \$60,000
     \]

#### 2. **Fuel Costs**
   - James spends twice as much as his monthly hangar rental on fuel.
   - Twice $5,000 per month equals:
     \[
     2 \times 5,000 = \$10,000 \text{ per month}
     \]
   - Over one year (12 months), this would be:
     \[
     10,000 \times 12 = \$120,000
     \]

#### 3. **Total Cost Before Maintenance**
   - Adding the total hangar rental cost and the total fuel cost:
     \[
     60,000 + 120,000 = \$180,000
     \]

#### 4. **Maintenance Costs**
   - We know the total cost before maintenance ($180,000) includes both the hangar rental and fuel costs.
   - Since the problem does not specify additional maintenance costs beyond these two items, we assume there are no other maintenance costs mentioned or calculated here.

### Final Answer:
The total amount James spent on getting and maintaining the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{\$180,000}
\]<|im_end|>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

So he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year
That means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and determine the total time taken to cook all the food.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T_r \) be the time (in minutes) it takes to cook rice.
   - Let \( T_b \) be the time (in minutes) it takes to cook beans.
   - Let \( T_p \) be the time (in minutes) it takes to cook pork.

2. **Given Information:**
   - \( T_r = 30 \) minutes.
   - The total time taken to cook pork is 20 more minutes than the total time taken to cook rice. So, \( T_p = T_r + 20 \).
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. So, \( T_b = \frac{1}{2}(T_p + T_r) \).

3. **Calculate Time for Pork:**
   - Substitute \( T_r \) into the equation for \( T_p \):
     \[
     T_p = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate Time for Beans:**
   - Use the formula for \( T_b \):
     \[
     T_b = \frac{1}{2}(T_p + T_r) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Sum Up All Times:**
   - Now add up the times for rice, beans, and pork:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = T_r + T_b + T_p = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it took Finley to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes.<|im_end|>","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to compare the total cost of two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
- Cost of almonds per pound = $10
- Cost of walnuts per pound = $15

Cost of 1/2 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \$10 = \$5 \]

Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \$5 \]

Total cost of this mixture:
\[ \$5 + \$5 = \$10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
- Cost of almonds per pound = $10
- Cost of walnuts per pound = $15

Cost of 1/5 pound almonds:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times \$10 = \$2 \]

Cost of 1/3 pound walnuts:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \$5 \]

Total cost of this mixture:
\[ \$2 + \$5 = \$7 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much more expensive the first mixture is compared to the second mixture.

Difference in cost:
\[ \$10 - \$7 = \$3 \]

Therefore, the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts) costs $3 more than the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{\$3}$<|im_end|>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm given that the total number of animal legs is 70 and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's denote:
- \( S \) as the number of sheep,
- \( G \) as the number of geese.

From the information provided:
1. Each sheep has 4 legs.
2. Each goose also has 4 legs.

We can set up the following equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of animal legs is:
\[ 4S + 4G = 70 \]

2. The total number of animal heads (which includes both sheep and geese):
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now let's solve these equations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Simplify the leg equation
Divide the entire leg equation by 4 to simplify it:
\[ S + G = \frac{70}{4} \]
\[ S + G = 17.5 \]

Since the number of animals must be an integer, there seems to be a mistake in our initial assumption or calculation. Let's correct this by considering the possibility that the number of legs per animal might not always be 4 for all animals.

### Step 2: Correct the leg equation
Given the total number of legs is 70, let’s assume different combinations where each animal could have a different number of legs but still sum up correctly to 70.

For example, if each sheep had 3 legs and each goose had 2 legs:
\[ 3S + 2G = 70 \]

And:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

### Step 3: Solve the new simplified system
Substitute \( G = 20 - S \) into the leg equation:
\[ 3S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]
\[ 3S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ S = 30 \]

So, there would be 30 sheep on the farm.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the number of sheep living on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{30}\).<|im_end|>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Roger bought. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of coffee Roger buys in a week.
Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for a week (7 days). So, the total amount of coffee needed is:
\[ \text{Total coffee} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the regular brand of coffee.
The regular brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. Since Roger needs 7 pounds of regular coffee, the cost would be:
\[ \text{Cost of regular coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$5/\text{pound} = \$35 \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the regular brand. Therefore, the price per pound of the more expensive brand is:
\[ \text{Price per pound of more expensive brand} = \$5 + 0.20 \times \$5 = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \]
So, the cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive brand coffee is:
\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost before buying the donuts.
The total cost before buying the donuts is the sum of the cost of the regular and more expensive brands of coffee:
\[ \text{Total cost before donuts} = \$35 + \$42 = \$77 \]

### Step 5: Add the cost of the donuts.
Roger buys a donut for $2, so the total cost after adding the donuts is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$77 + \$2 = \$79 \]

Therefore, the total amount Roger spent on everything is:
\[
\boxed{79}

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Gus paid for the apple pie, let's break down his spending into individual categories:

1. **Chips**:
   - Gus bought 2 bags of chips.
   - Each bag costs $2.00.
   - Total cost for chips: \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\).

2. **Fried Chicken**:
   - Gus bought one bucket of fried chicken.
   - The bucket costs $8.00.

3. **Soda**:
   - Gus bought one bottle of soda.
   - The bottle costs $1.00.

Now, let's add up all these expenses to find out how much Gus spent in total before buying the apple pie:

\[ \$4.00 (\text{chips}) + \$8.00 (\text{fried chicken}) + \$1.00 (\text{soda}) = \$13.00 \]

Gus spent a total of $13.00 on chips, fried chicken, and soda. If we assume that he had no money left after this purchase (since it states ""at the grocery store""), then the amount he could have spent on the apple pie would be the remaining balance from his initial $20.00.

So, if Gus started with $20.00 and spent $13.00 on other items, the remaining amount for the apple pie is:

\[ \$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The apple pie cost $\boxed{7.00}$.<|im_end|>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00

2. **Newspapers delivered to District A**: James delivers 198 newspapers to District A.
3. **Newspapers delivered to District C**: James delivers 209 newspapers to District C.

Now let's calculate the total number of newspapers delivered to Districts A and C combined:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C} = 198 + 209 = 407 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of newspapers delivered per day to find out how many newspapers were delivered to District B:

\[ \text{Total newspapers per day} - (\text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District C}) = 600 - 407 = 193 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of class hours**:
   - The class meets 4 times a week.
   - Each meeting lasts 2 hours.

   \[
   \text{Total class hours} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ hours per week}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of weeks**:
   - The class lasts for 6 weeks.

3. **Find out how many class hours in total**:
   - Multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks.

   \[
   \text{Total class hours (all together)} = 8 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of recipes learned**:
   - He learns one new recipe every 1.5 hours.

   \[
   \text{Number of recipes learned} = \frac{\text{Total class hours}}{1.5}
   \]

Let's perform the division now:

\[
\text{Number of recipes learned} = \frac{48}{1.5} = 32

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of math teachers**

- Total number of teachers = 150
- Percentage of history teachers = 60%
- Number of history teachers = \( 150 \times 0.60 = 90 \)

Since the remaining teachers are math teachers, we can find the number of math teachers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are **60 math teachers**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total sleep time for all teachers**

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours per day. Therefore, the total sleep time for all teachers combined would be:
\[ \text{Total sleep time} = 150 \times 6 \text{ hours/day} \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 150 \times 6 = 900 \text{ hours/day} \]

So, the total sleep time for all teachers combined is **900 hours/day**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Kassidy has.
Given that Aurelia has $120 and Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much as Aurelia.

\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times \$120 \]

Calculate Kassidy's amount:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Kassidy has $90.

### Step 2: Determine how much money Rayna has.
Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

\[ \text{Rayna's money} = \text{Kassidy's money} + 60 \]

Substitute Kassidy's amount:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Rayna has $150.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money when added together.
Now we need to find out what happens if they add their money together and then divide it equally.

Total money:

\[
\$120 (\text{Aurelia}) + \$90 (\text{Kassidy}) + \$150 (\text{Rayna}) = \$360
\]

### Step 4: Divide the total money equally among the three people.
To find out how much each person gets when they split the money equally:

\[
\frac{\$360}{3} = \$120
\]

Each person ends up with $120 after sharing equally.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: Each person will have $120.<|im_end|>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, and since Kassidy has $90, Rayna has $60+$90 = $<<60+90=150>>150
The three of them together has $210+$150 = $<<210+150=360>>360
If they decide to add up their money and share equally, each person would receive $360/3= $<<360/3=120>>120

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the length of one full quarter**
Each quarter is 12 minutes long.

**Step 2: Calculate the total length of all four quarters in the game**
Since there are 4 quarters and each is 12 minutes long:
\[ \text{Total time for all four quarters} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Determine how much time has passed during the last quarter before the extension**
In the last quarter, there was a tie. This means the game was paused or stopped at some point during that quarter to allow players to catch up.

**Step 4: Account for the extension added to the game duration**
After the pause, the game was extended for an additional 5 minutes.

**Step 5: Calculate the total duration of the entire game**
Add the original time (48 minutes) plus the extension (5 minutes):
\[ \text{Total duration} = 48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin and then multiply that by the number of muffins she plans to bake.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of dry ingredients per muffin.
- Flour: \(5\) tablespoons
- Sugar: \(3\) tablespoons
- Salt: \(0.25\) tablespoon

Total dry ingredients per muffin = Flour + Sugar + Salt
\[ \text{Total} = 5 + 3 + 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 8.25 \]

So, Svetlana needs **8.25 tablespoons** of dry ingredients for one muffin.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins.
Multiply the amount of dry ingredients per muffin by the number of muffins:
\[ \text{Total} = 8.25 \times 16 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 132 \]

Therefore, Svetlana would need **132 tablespoons** of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of candy Aaron has initially.
2. Calculate the total amount of candy when all three combine.
3. Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people (which is 3) to find out how much candy each person gets.

Step 1: Determine the amount of candy Aaron has initially.
Since the problem doesn't specify the initial amount of candy Aaron has, let's assume it's \( x \) pounds. 

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of candy when all three combine.
- Robert has 3 pounds.
- Cindy has 5 pounds.
- Aaron has \( x \) pounds.
So, the total amount of candy is \( 3 + 5 + x = 8 + x \).

Step 3: Divide the total amount of candy by the number of people (which is 3).
If they pool and share their candy equally, each person will get \( \frac{8 + x}{3} \) pounds of candy.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: \(\frac{8 + x}{3}\).<|im_end|>","Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the candies.
2. Determine how much money Adam gave to the cashier.
3. Subtract the total cost from what Adam gave to find out how much change he received.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candies

- Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
- Each candy of type A costs $0.5.

So, the cost for type A candies = \( 7 \times \$0.5 \)

\[
\$3.50 \text{ (total cost for type A)}
\]

- Adam also bought 10 candies of type B.
- Each candy of type B costs $0.75.

So, the cost for type B candies = \( 10 \times \$0.75 \)

\[
\$7.50 \text{ (total cost for type B)}
\]

Now, add the costs together to find the total amount Adam spent on candies.

\[
Total Cost = \$3.50 + \$7.50 = \$11
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Adam gave to the cashier

Adam paid the cashier $15.

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from what Adam gave to find out how much change he received

Change received = Amount given - Total cost

\[
Change Received = \$15 - \$11 = \$4
\]

Therefore, Adam got back **$4** as change.<|im_end|>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.

1. **Identify the total number of days**: The problem states that Christina has recorded her moods over 30 days.

2. **Determine the distribution of moods**:
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: Total - (Good + Bad) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 10

3. **Verify the distribution**:
   - Total days = Good + Bad + Neutral = 12 + 8 + 10 = 30, which matches the given information.

4. **Analyze the pattern**:

7. **Sum up all good days**:
   - Good days in the first period: 12
   - Good days in the second period: 7
   - Good days in the third period: 8

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has.

2. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has.
   
   Mathematically, this can be written as:
   \[
   J = 2S + 3
   \]
   where \( J \) represents the number of books Janey has.

3. **Substitute the known value for Janey's books:**
   We know from the problem statement that Janey has 21 books:
   \[
   21 = 2S + 3
   \]

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   To find out how many books Sally has, we first isolate \( S \). Start by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   21 - 3 = 2S
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   18 = 2S
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{18}{2} = S
   \]
   So,
   \[
   S = 9

5. **Verify the solution:**
   Check if our solution satisfies the original condition:
   \[
   J = 2S + 3 = 2(9) + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21

To determine how many days it will take for the bamboo plant to grow to 600 inches tall, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches**:
   - The current height of the bamboo plant is given as 20 feet.
   - There are 12 inches in one foot.

   \[
   \text{Current height (in inches)} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot}

   \[
   \text{Current height (in inches)} = 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining growth needed**:
   - We want the bamboo plant to reach 600 inches in total.
   - Currently, it is at 240 inches.

   \[
   \text{Remaining growth needed} = 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Remaining growth needed} = 360 \text{ inches}

   \[

                    question:
                    James : needs . to get more toys for his doggie shelter. . Each , dog needs ? one toy.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.
   - He has 4 dogs at the moment.

2. **Number of Dogs and Toys Needed**:
   - Each dog needs 1 toy.
   - So, if there are 4 dogs, they would need 4 toys.

3. **Current Toy Count**:
   - James already has 4 toys.

4. **Additional Dogs**:
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.

5. **Total Number of Dogs**:
   - Total dogs = Current dogs + Additional dogs
     \[
     4 \text{ (current)} + 8 \text{ (additional)} = 12 \text{ dogs}
     \]

6. **Number of Toys Required**:
   - Since each dog needs 1 toy,
     \[
     12 \text{ dogs} \times 1 \text{ toy per dog} = 12 \text{ toys}
     \]

7. **Toys Already Owned**:
   - James already has 4 toys.

8. **Toys Needed**:
   - To find out how many more toys James needs, subtract the number of toys he already owns from the total number required.
     \[
     12 \text{ toys needed} - 4 \text{ toys owned} = 8 \text{ toys needed}
     \]

9. **After Buying More Toys**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional toys bought after coming back to check.

10. **Checking Again**:
    - The number of dogs increases by 3, making the new count:
      \[
      12 \text{ (total dogs)} + 3 \text{ (dogs gone)} = 15 \text{ dogs}
      \]
    - Since there are now twice as many dogs as before leaving, we have:
      \[
      15 \text{ dogs} = 2 \times 7.5 \text{ (initial number)}
      \]

11. **New Toy Requirement**:
    - If there are now 15 dogs, they would need:
      \[
      15 \text{ dogs} \times 1 \text{ toy per dog} = 15 \text{ toys}
      \]

12. **Final Calculation**:
    - James bought enough toys to cover the new requirement:
      \[
      15 \text{ toys} - 12 \text{ (already owned)} = 3 \text{ toys remaining}
      \]

Therefore, James needs a total of **3 toys** in addition to the ones he already has.<|im_end|>","James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount initially invested:**
   \[
   \text{Total initial investment} = \$1200
   \]

2. **Determine Dylan's investment as a fraction of the total amount:**
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times \$1200

   \]

3. **Find the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$1200 - \$960 = \$240

   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   \text{Frances' investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 240 = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

5. **Find the remaining amount after Frances' investment:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$240 - \$160 = \$80

To determine how many additional signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of signatures needed:**
   - Each sister wants to reach 100 signatures.
   - Since there are two sisters, together they aim for \(100 \times 2 = 200\) signatures.

2. **Calculate the current total number of signatures collected so far:**
   - Carol has collected 20 signatures.
   - Jennifer has collected 44 signatures.
   - Together, they have \(20 + 44 = 64\) signatures.

3. **Subtract the current total from the goal:**
   - They still need \(200 - 64 = 136\) signatures to reach their goal.

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect a total of **136 signatures** to reach their goal by the end of the summer.<|im_end|>","Carol and Jennifer have already collected 20 + 44 signatures = <<20+44=64>>64 signatures.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much Karen earns per hour.
2. Calculate how many hours Karen works in one day.
3. Find out how much Karen earns in one day.
4. Multiply that amount by the number of days (2) to find her earnings over two days.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much Karen earns per hour
Lorie earns $10 per hour. Since Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, we calculate:
\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \text{Lorie's hourly wage} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many hours Karen works in one day
Karen works for 3 hours every day.

### Step 3: Find out how much Karen earns in one day
We multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in a day:
\[ \text{Karen's daily earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Number of hours per day} = \$20 \times 3 = \$60 \]

### Step 4: Multiply that amount by the number of days (2)
Now, we need to find out how much Karen earns over two days:
\[ \text{Total earnings in two days} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days} = \$60 \times 2 = \$120 \]

So, Karen earns a total of $120 in two days if she works 3 hours per day.

The final answer is: The final answer is $120.<|im_end|>","Karen earns $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 per hour.
So she earns $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 per day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 6 potatoes = 36 hash browns.

2. **Determine the ratio between potatoes and hash browns:**
   - First, we need to find out how many hash browns correspond to one potato.
     \[
     \text{Number of hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes:**
   - Since each potato produces 6 hash browns, for 96 potatoes:
     \[
     \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}

   Total number of people = 1 (Jack) + 8 (other adults) = 9 people.

2. **Calculate the combined weight**:
   Each person weighs approximately 80 kg.

   Combined weight of all people = Number of people × Weight per person

   = 720 kg.

3. **Compare the combined weight to the maximum load**:
   - Maximum allowed load: 700 kg.
   - Actual load: 720 kg.

4. **Calculate the excess load**:
   Excess load = Actual load - Maximum allowed load
   = 720 kg - 700 kg

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cookies Max has.
- We know that Katarina has 5 fewer cookies than Max.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of cookies Max has.
- Given that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can write the equation:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

### Step 2: Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Let \( CM \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
- Using the value of Max from above:
\[ 73 = CM + 12 \]
Solving for \( CM \):
\[ CM = 73 - 12 \]
\[ CM = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

### Step 3: Determine the number of cookies Summer has.
- We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Since Max has 73 cookies:
\[ 73 = S + 23 \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = 73 - 23 \]
\[ S = 50 \]

So, Summer has 50 cookies.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies all three have together.
- Adding up all their cookies:
\[ Total = K + M + CM + S \]
Substituting the values we found:
\[ Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 50 \]
\[ Total = 252 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have together is **252**.<|im_end|>","Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress.

### Step 2: Calculate the Extended Length
Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. So, she extends the dress by \( 0.5L \).

### Step 3: Add Additional Lengths
She adds an additional 20 cm at the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
According to the problem, the total length after these modifications is 140 cm.

So, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ L + 0.5L + 20 = 140 \]

### Step 5: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[ 1.5L + 20 = 140 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( L \)
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 1.5L = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ L = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ L = 80 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the original length of the dress is **80 cm**.<|im_end|>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

Adding the original length and the extended length, which is x+x/2 = 120
3/2x = 120

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Chris to mow half of his lawn using both modes.

### Step 1: Determine the time for one full lawn in each mode.
- **Turtle Mode**: It takes 60 minutes (1 hour) to mow the entire lawn.
- **Rabbit Mode**: It takes 40 minutes (40 minutes) to mow the entire lawn.

### Step 2: Calculate the time for half the lawn in each mode.
Since Chris mowed half the lawn in each mode, we simply divide the total time by 2.

#### Turtle Mode:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Time}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

#### Rabbit Mode:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Time}}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Add the times together to find the total time spent on half the lawn.
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Turtle Time} + \text{Rabbit Time} = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow half of his lawn.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total time available:**
   - They have 30 minutes in total.

2. **Time spent at the corner (library):**
   - They spend 6 minutes at the corner.
   
3. **Time spent getting to the fire station:**
   - After reaching the corner, they take an additional 13 minutes to reach the fire station.
   
4. **Calculate the remaining time after these two activities:**
   - Total time available = 30 minutes
   - Time at the corner + Time to fire station = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes
   
5. **Subtract the time already used from the total time:**
   - Remaining time = Total time - Used time
   - Remaining time = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Catherine bought at the grocery store.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate the cost of apples:
Catherine buys 1 kilogram of apples.
Cost per kilogram = $4

\[ \text{Total cost of apples} = 1 \times 4 = \$4 \]

#### 2. Calculate the cost of bananas:
Catherine buys 2 kilograms of bananas.
Cost per kilogram = $2

\[ \text{Total cost of bananas} = 2 \times 2 = \$4 \]

#### 3. Calculate the cost of oranges:
Catherine buys 2 kilograms of oranges.
Cost per kilogram = $3

\[ \text{Total cost of oranges} = 2 \times 3 = \$6 \]

#### 4. Add up all costs to get the total amount paid:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of bananas} + \text{Cost of oranges} \]
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 4 + 4 + 6 = \$14 \]

   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.
   - Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta.
   - Therefore, Celinda bakes \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies.

2. **Determine the total number of cookies baked:**
   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.
   - Celinda bakes 60 cookies.
   - Total cookies baked = \(30 + 60 = 90\).

3. **Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total:**
   - They eat 10 cookies.
   - Number of cookies left = \(90 - 10 = 80\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of cookies in the box after eating is 80.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have two sets of twins.
   - We also have one set of triplets.
   - One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

2. **Define variables:**
   Let \( T \) represent the age of one twin.
   Let \( T' \) represent the age of the other twin (since they are twins).
   Let \( T_3 \) represent the age of one triplet.
   Let \( T'_3 \) represent the age of the other triplet (since they are triplets).

3. **Set up equations based on the given conditions:**
   Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet:
   \[
   T = T_3 + 7
   \]

4. **Sum of all ages:**
   The total sum of their ages is given as 44:
   \[
   T + T_3 = 44
   \]

5. **Substitute the expression for \( T \) from Step 3 into the equation in Step 4:**
   \[
   (T_3 + 7) + T_3 = 44
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2T_3 + 7 = 44
   \]

6. **Solve for \( T_3 \):**
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2T_3 = 37
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   T_3 = 18.5
   \]

7. **Find \( T \) using \( T = T_3 + 7 \):**
   Substitute \( T_3 = 18.5 \):
   \[
   T = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5
   \]

Therefore, the age of one twin is \(\boxed{25.5}\).<|im_end|>","Let T = age of triplet

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much time John has left for a nap after completing all his homework assignments, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total homework time:**
   - Math homework: 20 minutes
   - Reading homework: 40 minutes
   - History homework: 20 minutes

   Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

2. **Convert hours into minutes (since John also needs time for eating):**
   - Since John needs time for dinner in addition to homework, we need to consider that he will be awake for at least one hour (60 minutes) before he can start doing homework.
   
   Therefore, John needs an additional 60 minutes just for the preparation and dining process.

3. **Sum up all required times including the homework and the prep/dining time:**
   - Homework time (including preparation): 80 minutes
   - Prep/Dining time: 60 minutes
   
   Total time needed: 80 + 60 = 140 minutes.

4. **Subtract the total time needed from the total available time:**
   - Total time available: 3 hours = 180 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
  
   Time left for nap = 180 - 140 = 40 minutes.

Therefore, John has **40 minutes** left to take a nap.<|im_end|>","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.

\]

2. **Determine the total cost of all candies:**
   - Manolo bought four candies.
   - Each candy costs $3.20.

\[
\text{Total cost for candies} = 4 \times \$3.20 = \$12.80
\]

3. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent so far:**

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$2.00 (\text{lollipops}) + \$12.80 (\text{candies}) = \$14.80

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Rong and Neil have saved over ten years given that Rong saves 20 coins per month and Neil saves 2/5 times as much as Rong.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Rong's monthly savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.
   
2. **Determine Neil's monthly savings:**
   - Neil saves 2/5 times as much as Rong.
   \[
   \text{Neil's monthly savings} = 20 \times \frac{2}{5}
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of months in ten years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, there are \(12 \times 10 = 120\) months in ten years.

4. **Calculate the total amount saved by Rong over ten years:**
   - Since Rong saves 20 coins per month for 120 months:
   \[
   \text{Total saved by Rong} = 20 \times 120
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins}

5. **Calculate the total amount saved by Neil over ten years:**
   - Since Neil saves 8 coins per month for 120 months:
   \[
   \text{Total saved by Neil} = 8 \times 120
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   8 \times 120 = 960 \text{ coins}
   \]

### Final Answer:
After calculating both amounts, we find that Rong and Neil have saved a combined total of:
\[
2400 + 960 = 3360 \text{ coins}

If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the heartworm test.
- The heartworm test costs $60.

### Step 2: Determine the total amount spent on vaccines.
- Each vaccine costs $20 and there are 2 vaccines needed.
\[ \text{Total cost of vaccines} = 2 \times \$20 = \$40 \]

### Step 3: Add the cost of the heartworm test to the cost of the vaccines.
- Total cost before the heartworm check (including vaccines) = $40 + $60 = $100.

### Step 4: Calculate the total bill based on the information given about the heartworm check being 60% of the total bill.
- Let \( T \) be the total bill.
- According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
\[ 0.6T = \$100 \]
\[ T = \frac{\$100}{0.6} \]
\[ T = \$166.67 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the total bill from what John brought.
- John brought $125.
\[ \text{Amount left} = \$125 - \$166.67 \]
\[ \text{Amount left} = -\$41.67 \]

Since we cannot have negative money in this context, it indicates that John would need an additional $41.67 to cover the total bill.

4. **Sum up the number of each type of fruit in the crate:**
   - There are 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
   
5. **Calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:**
   - Total cost for bananas:

   - Total cost for oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 7 \times \$3.0 = \$21.0
     \]

6. **Add up all the costs to get the total price of the crate:**
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \$5.0 + \$6.0 + \$21.0 = \$32.0
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$32.0}

To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to determine the number of squares for each color and then sum them up.

Step 1: Determine the number of red squares.
Given that there are 14 red squares.

Step 2: Determine the number of blue squares.
Since there are 4 more blue squares than red squares,

Step 4: Determine the number of white squares.
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares,
\[ \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12 \]

Step 5: Calculate the total number of squares on the comforter.
Summing up all the squares gives us the total area in square feet,
\[ \text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 70 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The comforter is \(70\) square feet.<|im_end|>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.
With 6 more green than blue squares, the comforter has 24 green squares.
With 12 fewer white squares than green squares, the comforter has 12 white squares.
In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.
Thus, the comforter is 68 square feet.

                    question:
                    ! Tomorrow, 42 adults and ! 15 babies will be attending ? a , function at Mia’s restaurant. ; The restaurant has , 5 times : as many regular , chairs as : high chairs. If there are ? 8 high chairs, how many ? more chairs does she , have to get?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of high chairs:**
   - There are 8 high chairs.

2. **Calculate the number of regular chairs:**
   - The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
   - Therefore, the number of regular chairs = \( 5 \times 8 \) = 40.

3. **Calculate the total number of seats available:**
   - Total seats = High chairs + Regular chairs
   - Total seats = 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs)
   - Total seats = 48.

4. **Determine the total number of attendees:**
   - There are 42 adults and 15 babies.
   - Total attendees = 42 (adults) + 15 (babies)
   - Total attendees = 57.

5. **Compare the total number of seats needed with the total number of seats available:**
   - Number of additional chairs needed = Total attendees - Total seats
   - Number of additional chairs needed = 57 (attendees) - 48 (seats)

6. **Calculate the difference between the required and available seats:**
   - Difference in chairs = 57 (attendees) - 48 (seats)
   - Difference in chairs = 9.

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs for the event.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is} 9 chairs.<|im_end|>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of buck deer:**
   - We know that 50% of the deer are bucks.
   - Therefore, the number of buck deer = \( 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \).

2. **Calculate the percentage of 8-point bucks among the buck deer:**
   - We're given that 20% of the bucks are 8-point.
   - So, we need to find out how many of these 25 bucks are 8-point.

3. **Find the number of 8-point bucks:**
   - To do this, we'll multiply the total number of bucks (25) by the percentage of bucks that are 8-point (20%).

\[
\text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right)
\]

4. **Simplify the multiplication:**

\[
\text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5
\]

So, there are 5 8-point bucks in the field.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points the class needs to reach the trip requirement and then calculate how many points the students have already collected.

1. **Determine Betty's Points:**
   - Adam has 50 points.
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - Therefore, Betty's points = 50 + (30/100) * 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 points.

2. **Determine Marta's Points:**
   - Marta collects 3 times as many points as Tom.
   - Tom has 30 points.
   - Therefore, Marta's points = 3 * 30 = 90 points.

3. **Calculate Total Points Collected by All Students:**
   - Adam: 50 points.
   - Betty: 65 points.
   - Tom: 30 points.
   - Martha: 90 points.
   - Summing these up gives us the total points collected so far.
   - Total points = 50 + 65 + 30 + 90 = 235 points.

4. **Determine the Minimum Number of Points Needed to Reach the Trip Requirement:**
   - The trip requires at least 400 points.
   - Since the current total is 235 points, the number of points needed is:
     400 - 235 = 165 points.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, the class needs **165 additional points** to meet the trip requirement and ensure all students qualify for the trip.<|im_end|>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

To determine the number of great-grandbabies that will be present during the family reunion, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Grandma Jones** has three children.
2. Each of these children has three children of their own (these children are considered grandchildren).
3. Each of these grandchildren also has three babies themselves.

Now, let's calculate the total number of great-grandbabies:

- Grandma Jones has \(3\) children.
- Each of these \(3\) children has \(3\) grandchildren.
- Therefore, the total number of grandchildren from these children is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

Each of these \(9\) grandchildren has \(3\) babies.

So, the total number of great-grandbabies is calculated as follows:
\[ 9 \text{ grandchildren} \times 3 \text{ babies per grandchild} = 27 \text{ great-grandbabies} \]

Therefore, if all of the family members attend the reunion, there will be \(27\) great-grandbabies for Grandma Jones to kiss.<|im_end|>","Three children each have three children, for a total of 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 grandchildren.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many fireworks Hannah will see in two different locations: her home and her backyard.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Part 1: Fireworks at Her Home

1. **Calculate the number of fireworks at her home:**
   - Hannah has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
   - Total fireworks at her home = Number of boxes * Number of fireworks per box.
     \[
     15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ fireworks}
     \]

#### Part 2: Fireworks in Her Backyard

2. **Calculate the number of fireworks in her backyard:**
   - Hannah has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
   - Total fireworks in her backyard = Number of boxes * Number of fireworks per box.
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ fireworks}
     \]

#### Final Calculation

3. **Add the total fireworks from both locations:**
   - Total fireworks seen by Hannah = Fireworks at home + Fireworks in backyard.
     \[
     300 + 15 = 315 \text{ fireworks}
     \]

### Conclusion

Hannah will see a total of 315 fireworks on the Fourth of July.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 315.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people in the group.
- There are 4 friends (Aiden + 12 friends).
- Additional friends join them = 7 more friends.
Total number of people = 4 + 12 + 7 = 23 people.

### Step 2: Calculate the total seating capacity needed for snacks and drinks.
Each seat can accommodate:
- One person
- Two drinks
- Three snacks

Since they need enough space for all their friends, drinks, and snacks:

- Total seats required = 23 (since every seat must be occupied).

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost per item.
Cost per drink = $2
Cost per snack = $2

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for drinks.
Number of drinks required = Number of people * Drinks per person = 23 * 2 = 46 drinks
Total cost for drinks = 46 drinks * $2 per drink = $92

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for snacks.
Number of snacks required = Number of people * Snacks per person = 23 * 3 = 69 snacks
Total cost for snacks = 69 snacks * $2 per snack = $138

### Step 6: Add the costs together to get the total amount spent.
Total amount spent on snacks and drinks = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $92 + $138 = $230

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{230}\).<|im_end|>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.

In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of Gordy's truck.
- We know that Gissela’s truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
- Gordy’s truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela’s truck.

So, if Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds, then:
\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total capacity of all three trucks together.
- The combined capacity of Gissela, Gordy, and Gary's truck should be equal to 11,600 pounds.

Let \( x \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck in pounds.

According to the information given:
\[ 4,000 (Gissela's truck) + 4,800 (Gordy's truck) + x (Gary's truck) = 11,600 \]

### Step 3: Solve for Gary's truck capacity.
We have:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]
\[ 9,800 + x = 11,600 \]

Subtract 9,800 from both sides:
\[ x = 11,600 - 9,800 \]
\[ x = 1,800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry **1,800** pounds of gravel.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 1,800 \text{ pounds}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people at the gathering.
- Number of males = 8 (including Larry)
- Number of females = 6
- Total number of people = 8 (males) + 6 (females) = 14 people

### Step 2: Calculate how many dumplings each person ate.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Let \( x \) be the number of dumplings each male ate.
- According to the problem, each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Therefore, each male ate \( 3 + 1 = 4 \) dumplings.

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the total number of dumplings eaten.
- The total number of dumplings eaten by all males should equal the total number of dumplings eaten by all females plus the total number of dumplings eaten by Larry.
- Total dumplings eaten by all males = \( 8 \times 4 \).
- Total dumplings eaten by all females = \( 6 \times 3 \).

Let \( L \) be the number of dumplings Larry ate. We can set up the following equation:

\[ 8 \times 4 + 6 \times 3 + L = 8 \times 4 + 6 \times 3 \]

Simplify both sides:

\[ 32 + 18 + L = 32 + 18 \]
\[ 50 + L = 50 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( L \), the number of dumplings Larry ate.
\[ L = 50 - 50 \]
\[ L = 0 \]

However, since we know that Larry did not eat any leftover dumplings, we need to reconsider our approach. The correct interpretation should be that Larry's consumption does not contribute to the total number of dumplings consumed because he didn't participate in the eating process as per the given information.

Therefore, Larry did not cook any dumplings himself.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} Larry did not cook any dumplings.<|im_end|>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total parts of the ratio.
The ratio given is 3:2. This means that for every 5 parts (3 + 2), 3 parts belong to Gerald and 2 parts belong to Julia.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of one part.
Since the total amount is $100, we divide this by the total number of parts (5).

\[ \text{Value per part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Gerald's initial amount.
Gerald has 3 parts out of the total 5 parts.

\[ \text{Initial amount for Gerald} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the amount spent from Gerald's initial amount.
Gerald spends $10 on a book.

\[ \text{Amount left after spending} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Gerald has $50 left after spending $10 on a book.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$50}
\]<|im_end|>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the turtle**:
   - We know that the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet per second.
   - The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.
   
2. **Calculate the speed of the turtle**:
   - Let \( v_t \) be the speed of the turtle.
   - Since the cat is 5 times faster, \( v_c = 5 \times v_t \).
   - Given \( v_c = 15 \) feet per second, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     15 = 5 \times v_t
     \]
   - Solving for \( v_t \):
     \[
     v_t = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distance the turtle can travel in 40 seconds**:
   - Distance (d) can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     d = 3 \text{ feet per second} \times 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Simplifying:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the remaining amount needed
The total goal is $6300, and after the first three hours, they have raised $2100.
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$6300 - \$2100 = \$4200 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the rate at which they need to raise money per hour
We know that they still need to raise $4200 over the remaining time. Let \( h \) be the number of additional hours required.

Since they want to reach their goal as quickly as possible, we assume they will raise money equally each hour until they run out of funds or cover the remaining amount.

### Step 3: Set up the equation for raising money
Let \( R \) represent the amount raised per hour. We can write the equation based on the total amount needed ($4200):
\[ 3h + Rh = \$4200 \]
Here, \( 3h \) represents the money raised in the first three hours, and \( Rh \) represents the money raised in the remaining hours.

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
Factor out \( h \):
\[ h(3 + R) = \$4200 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( h \)
Divide both sides by \( (3 + R) \):
\[ h = \frac{\$4200}{3 + R} \]

### Step 6: Find the value of \( R \)
Given that they want to reach their goal as quickly as possible, we assume \( R \) should be maximized. However, since no specific maximum value is given, we'll consider practical limits.

For simplicity, let's assume they aim to maximize fundraising efficiency within reasonable constraints (e.g., not exceeding daily fundraising capacity).

If they aim to maximize fundraising efficiency without exceeding daily fundraising capacity, they might set \( R \) such that the average rate is realistic but high enough to push towards the goal.

Assuming they start from zero and aim to match the initial rate if feasible:
\[ R = \frac{\$2100}{3} = \$70 \]

Now substitute \( R \) back into our equation for \( h \):
\[ h = \frac{\$4200}{3 + \$70} = \frac{\$4200}{\$73} \approx 58.29 \]

### Final Calculation
Substitute \( h \) back into the original equation:
\[ 3(58.29) + 58.29x = \$4200 \]
\[ 174.87 + 58.29x = \$4200 \]
\[ 58.29x = \$4200 - \$174.87 \]
\[ 58.29x = \$4025.13 \]
\[ x \approx \frac{\$4025.13}{\$58.29} \approx 69.33 \]

Thus, they would need approximately **69** more hours to reach their goal.

### Conclusion
They have approximately **69** hours left to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{69}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes given that 80% of the water used by the city comes from the Colorado River.

1. **Identify the total amount of water used by the city:**
   - The city uses 40% of the water.
   
2. **Determine the proportion of water used by the city from the Colorado River:**
   - Since 80% of the water used by the city comes from the Colorado River, we can find out the percentage of the river's total water used by the city by dividing these two percentages.
   
3. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ice cream (either chocolate or vanilla) can be produced per hour for both types of ice cream and then use that information to calculate the total amount of ice cream produced over 48 hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Chocolate Ice Cream Production Rate:
1. **Total Quarts Produced**: The factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
2. **Rate Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Chocolate Ice Cream Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Quarts}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

#### Vanilla Ice Cream Production Rate:
1. **Total Quarts Produced**: The factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
2. **Rate Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Vanilla Ice Cream Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Quarts}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{50}{4} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour}
   \]

#### Total Quarts Produced Over 48 Hours:
1. **Total Time**: We want to know the total production over 48 hours.
2. **Total Quarts for Chocolate Ice Cream**:
   \[
   \text{Total Quarts} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 50 \times 48 = 2400 \text{ quarts}
   \]
3. **Total Quarts for Vanilla Ice Cream**:
   \[
   \text{Total Quarts} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 12.5 \times 48 = 600 \text{ quarts}
   \]
4. **Total Quarts for Both Types**:
   \[
   \text{Total Quarts} = \text{Choco Quarts} + \text{Vanilla Quarts} = 2400 + 600 = 3000 \text{ quarts}

To determine the total cost for Marcus's order, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately, sum them up, apply the discount if applicable, and then add any shipping costs (though they're not provided in the information given). Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of item
- **Croissants**: 
  - Number: 5
  - Cost per piece: $3.00
  - Total cost for croissants = 5 × $3.00 = $15.00

- **Cinnamon Rolls**:
  - Number: 4
  - Cost per roll: $2.50
  - Total cost for cinnamon rolls = 4 × $2.50 = $10.00

- **Mini Quiches**:
  - Number: 3
  - Cost per quiche: $4.00
  - Total cost for mini quiches = 3 × $4.00 = $12.00

- **Blueberry Muffins**:
  - Number: 13
  - Cost per muffin: $1.00
  - Total cost for muffins = 13 × $1.00 = $13.00

### Step 2: Sum up all item costs
Total cost before discount = $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount
Discount amount = 10% of $50.00 = 0.10 × $50.00 = $5.00

### Step 4: Subtract the discount from the total cost
Final total cost after discount = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can afford given her budget. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the Deal Offer
- **Deal**: Buy 2 scoops for free.
- **Cost per Scoop**: $1.50

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost for One Scoop
- Since one scoop costs $1.50, we will first calculate what she would spend on two scoops.

### Step 3: Determine How Many Free Scoops She Can Get
- For every 2 scoops bought, she gets 1 free scoop.

### Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Number of Scoops She Can Afford
Let's denote the number of scoops as \( n \).

- If she buys \( n \) scoops, she will get \( \frac{n}{2} \) free scoops (since she only needs to pay for half the scoops).
- Therefore, the total number of scoops she can have is \( n + \frac{n}{2} = \frac{3n}{2} \).

### Step 5: Set Up an Equation Based on Her Budget
- We know that Erin has $6.00 in total.
- Each scoop costs $1.50, so the equation representing her budget is:
\[ 1.50n = 6.00 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)
- Divide both sides by $1.50$ to find out how many scoops she can buy:
\[ n = \frac{6.00}{1.50} \]
\[ n = 4 \]

So, Erin can afford to buy 4 scoops of ice cream. 

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 4 scoops}}
\]<|im_end|>","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.

### Step 2: Determine how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.
Amy eats 3 pieces per day. There are 7 days in a week.

- Calculate the total number of candies Amy eats in one week:
  \[
  3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ pieces}
  \]

- Calculate the total number of candies Amy eats in two weeks:
  \[
  21 \text{ pieces/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 42 \text{ pieces}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine how much candy each has left after two weeks.
- Calculate how many candies Ginger has left:
  \[
  100 \text{ initial pieces} - 56 \text{ eaten} = 44 \text{ pieces remaining}
  \]

- Calculate how many candies Amy has left:
  \[
  100 \text{ initial pieces} - 42 \text{ eaten} = 58 \text{ pieces remaining}
  \]

### Step 4: Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger.
- Subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
  \[
  58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
  \]

### Final Answer:
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 14}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the the difference in the number of pieces of candy the two people each per day: 4 pieces/day - 3 pieces/day = <<4-3=1>>1 piece/day

                    question:
                    James decides to pick some blueberries.  It cost $20 ; to . go : picking and . then ? another $1.5 per ! pound.  ! He picked ? 30 pounds : of blueberries.  How , much did , he save compared to buying at the store ; for $2.5 a pound?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much James saved compared to buying blueberries from the store, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost if James bought the blueberries at the store.
James buys blueberries at a price of $2.5 per pound.

- Number of pounds of blueberries picked = 30 pounds
- Price per pound = $2.5

Total cost = (Number of pounds) × (Price per pound)
                = 30 pounds × $2.5/pound
                = $75

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost if James picks the blueberries himself.
First, calculate the cost of picking the blueberries:

- Cost of picking = $20

Next, add the cost per pound of blueberries picked:

- Cost per pound of blueberries picked = $1.5/pound
- Total cost of blueberries picked = (Pounds of blueberries) × (Cost per pound)

Let's assume the weight of the blueberries picked is \( x \) pounds.

\[ \text{Total cost of blueberries} = \$20 + x \times \$1.5 \]

Now, sum up all costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20 + (\text{Weight of blueberries}) \times \$1.5 \]

Since we don't know the exact weight of the blueberries picked, let’s denote it as \( w \).

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20 + w \times \$1.5 \]

We will now find out the savings by comparing this total cost with the store price.

### Step 3: Determine the savings.
Savings can be calculated by subtracting the total cost of picking blueberries from the total cost if purchased at the store.

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost at store} - \text{Total cost of picking blueberries} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$75 - (\$20 + w \times \$1.5) \]

Substitute \( w \):

\[ \text{Savings} = \$75 - (\$20 + w \times \$1.5) \]

Given that the total cost when purchasing blueberries is $75:

\[ \text{Savings} = \$75 - \$75 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$0 \]

Therefore, James would have no savings because his total cost matches exactly what he would pay in-store. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original price per computer
- The company originally planned to spend $700 on 500 computers.
- Let's denote the original price per computer as \( P \).

From the given information:
\[ 500 \times P = 700 \]

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{700}{500} = 1.4 \]
So, the original price per computer is $1.4.

### Step 2: Adjust the price due to the 10% increase
- The actual price per computer is 10% higher than the original price.
- Therefore, the new price per computer is:
\[ P_{\text{new}} = P + (P \times 0.1) \]

Substituting \( P = 1.4 \):
\[ P_{\text{new}} = 1.4 + (1.4 \times 0.1) \]
\[ P_{\text{new}} = 1.4 + 0.14 \]
\[ P_{\text{new}} = 1.54 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on 500 computers at the new price
- Now that we know the new price per computer ($1.54), we can calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 500 \times P_{\text{new}} \]

Substituting \( P_{\text{new}} = 1.54 \):
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 500 \times 1.54 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 770 \]

### Conclusion
The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is **$770**.<|im_end|>","When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70

                    question:
                    John ! makes himself a 6 ? egg omelet with 2 oz ? of . cheese and an equal amount : of ham.  ! Eggs are 75 calories each. !  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce. ?  ! Ham is ! 40 calories per ; ounce.  How many . calories is the . omelet?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs used
John uses 6 eggs in total.

- Each egg has 75 calories.
- Therefore, for 6 eggs, the total calorie count from eggs = \( 6 \times 75 \) calories.

\[ 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of cheese used
John uses 2 ounces of cheese.

- Each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories.
- Therefore, for 2 ounces of cheese, the total calorie count from cheese = \( 2 \times 120 \) calories.

\[ 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of ham used
Since the problem states that John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese (2 ounces), we can calculate the ham calories similarly to how we did for the cheese.

- Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories.
- Therefore, for 2 ounces of ham, the total calorie count from ham = \( 2 \times 40 \) calories.

\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 4: Sum up all components
Now, let's add up the calories from all three ingredients to find the total caloric content of the omelet.

- Calories from eggs: 450 calories
- Calories from cheese: 240 calories
- Calories from ham: 80 calories

Total calories = \( 450 + 240 + 80 \)

\[ 450 + 240 + 80 = 830 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{830}
\]<|im_end|>","The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of the pencils.
- Each pencil costs $0.50.
- You bought 6 pencils.

\[ \text{Total cost for pencils} = 6 \times \$0.50 = \$3.00 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total cost of the erasers.
- Each eraser costs $0.25.
- You bought 8 erasers.

\[ \text{Total cost for erasers} = 8 \times \$0.25 = \$2.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on both pencils and erasers.
- Add the cost of the pencils to the cost of the erasers.

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from the total payment made.
- You paid $10 in total.

\[ \text{Change received} = \$10 - \$5.00 = \$5.00 \]

### Conclusion:

To solve this problem, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of applicants who receive interviews.
- Total applicants = 100
- Percentage receiving interviews = 30%

\[ \text{Number of applicants receiving interviews} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} \]

\[

So, **6 people** receive job offers.

### Step 3: Determine the number of applicants who accept the position.
- Percentage accepting positions = $\frac{1}{3}$ (since they are a third)

\[ \text{Number of applicants accepting positions} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} \]

\[
= 6 \times \frac{1}{3}
\]
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total tap rate when her arms are raised:**
   - When her arms are raised, her tap rate for both feet slows down to 200 taps per minute.
   
2. **Determine how many taps occur during the time her arms are raised (2 minutes):**
   - Her tap rate when her arms are raised = 200 taps per minute.
   - Time her arms are raised = 2 minutes.
   - Number of taps per minute * Time in minutes = Total taps during that period.

\[
200 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 400 \text{ taps}
\]

3. **Calculate the total tap rate when her arms are lowered:**
   - When her arms are lowered, her tap rate for both feet remains at 300 taps per minute.
   
4. **Determine how many taps occur during the time her arms are lowered (3 minutes):**
   - Her tap rate when her arms are lowered = 300 taps per minute.
   - Time her arms are lowered = 3 minutes.
   - Number of taps per minute * Time in minutes = Total taps during that period.

\[
300 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 900 \text{ taps}
\]

5. **Calculate the total number of taps over the entire duration:**
   - Total taps from lowering her arms = 900 taps.
   - Total taps from raising her arms = 400 taps.
   - Sum these values gives the total number of taps.

\[
900 \text{ taps} + 400 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate both the costs involved in not fixing the pothole (the damage) and the additional costs associated with fixing it (the purchase of asphalt).

### Step 1: Calculate the potential damage from not fixing the pothole.
Ron estimates that the damage to his car could be worth $450.

### Step 2: Determine the total additional costs associated with fixing the pothole.
- Cost per bucket of asphalt = $25
- Number of buckets needed = 3
- Total cost for asphalt = $25 × 3 = $75

### Step 3: Sum up all the costs.
- Damage to car = $450
- Additional costs for asphalt = $75

Total additional costs = $450 + $75 = $525

### Step 4: Compare the total additional costs to the estimated damage.
$525 > $450

This means the actual damage would be less than what Ron has calculated ($525 < $450), but this information isn't directly relevant to determining whether Ron saves money or incurs more expenses.

### Conclusion:
Since the estimated damage ($450) is lower than the actual damage ($525), Ron will incur more expense by not fixing the pothole. Therefore, Ron **does** save money by fixing the pothole.

The final answer is: The final answer is The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\). Ron does not save any money; instead, he will incur an additional expense due to the refusal to fix the pothole.<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75
Now subtract the cost of the asphalt and the fine from the cost of the damage Ron avoids: $450 - $75 - $120 = $<<450-75-120=255>>255

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of normal chairs sent to the carpenter**
- Total normal chairs = 170
- Number of normal chairs sent to the carpenter = 20%

Number of normal chairs sent to the carpenter = (20/100) * 170

\[ \text{Normal chairs sent} = 20\% \times 170 = 0.2 \times 170 = 34 \]

So, 34 normal chairs were sent to the carpenter.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of baby chairs sent to the carpenter**
- Total baby chairs = 23
- Number of baby chairs sent to the carpenter = 13%

Number of baby chairs sent to the carpenter = (13/100) * 23

\[ \text{Baby chairs sent} = 13\% \times 23 = 0.13 \times 23 = 3.09 \]

Since we cannot send partial chairs, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, 4 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs sent to the carpenter**
- Normal chairs sent = 34
- Baby chairs sent = 4

Total chairs sent to the carpenter = 34 + 4 = 38

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of chairs**

Total original number of chairs = 170 (normal) + 23 (baby) = 193

Remaining chairs after sending to the carpenter = 193 - 38 = 155

Therefore, the restaurant has **155 chairs left**.<|im_end|>","Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pizzas ordered.
Since there are 5 people (Bryce + 4 friends) and each person ordered one pizza, the total number of pizzas ordered is:
\[ 5 \text{ pizzas} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much of each pizza was eaten by Bryce and his friends.
Each pizza has 12 slices.

- **Bryce and two friends** ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
  
  - For one pizza:
    \[ \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices} \]
  
  - Since they ordered five pizzas in total, for all five pizzas:
    \[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ slices} \]

- **Two remaining friends** ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.

  - For one pizza:
    \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices} \]
  
  - Since they ordered five pizzas in total, for all five pizzas:
    \[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of pizza eaten.
Summing up the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends plus the two remaining friends:
\[ 40 \text{ slices (Bryce)} + 45 \text{ slices (two friends)} = 85 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount of pizza eaten from the total number of slices ordered.
Total number of slices ordered minus the slices eaten gives us the number of slices left:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza that were left is:
\[ 60 - 85 = -25 \text{ slices} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]<|im_end|>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it would take for both the cat and the dog to eat their respective amounts of sausages.

### Step 1: Determine the eating rate of the cat
- The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
- Therefore, the cat's eating rate is \(\frac{9}{30} = 0.3\) sausages per minute.

### Step 2: Determine the eating rate of the dog
- The dog eats the same number of sausages as the cat (9 sausages) but at a different rate.
- We know that the dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time the cat does to eat the same amount of sausages.
- Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog will take \(\frac{2}{3}\) of that time:
  \[
  \text{Dog's time} = 30 \times \frac{2}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 3: Verify the dog's eating rate
- If the dog eats 9 sausages in 20 minutes, its eating rate should be:
  \[
  \text{Dog's eating rate} = \frac{9}{20} = 0.45 \text{ sausages per minute}
  \]
- This matches our earlier calculation of 0.3 sausages per minute since \(\frac{9}{20} = 0.45\).

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for both cats and dogs together
- Both animals eat at their respective rates simultaneously.
- Let \( T \) be the total time they take together.
- Since they work independently, the combined rate is the sum of individual rates:
  \[
  \text{Combined rate} = 0.3 + 0.45 = 0.75 \text{ sausages per minute}
  \]
- They together eat \( 9 \) sausages in \( T \) minutes:
  \[
  0.75T = 9
  \]
- Solving for \( T \):
  \[
  T = \frac{9}{0.75} = 12 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Final Answer
The average time the two take to eat all the sausages together is **12 minutes**.<|im_end|>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.

The average time in minutes that the two take to eat the sausages is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the information given about the lengths of their shoes.
3. Solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Convert Topher's Shoe Length to Inches

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.

First, convert feet to inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ 8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches} \]

Now add the additional 4 inches:
\[ 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

#### Step 2: Set Up the Equation

We know that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.

According to the problem, Topher's shoe length can also be expressed as:
\[ 10 = 9x + 10 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

Substitute the known value into the equation:
\[ 10 = 9x + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 0 = 9x \]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = 0 \]

This result seems incorrect because it implies that Bobby has no shoes at all, which contradicts the context provided in the problem. Let's re-evaluate the setup of the equation.

Given that Topher's shoe is 100 inches long, we should have:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = 10 \]

Thus, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches**.<|im_end|>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

2. **Calculate the fraction of student car windows Hannah smashes:**
   - Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the student car windows.
   \[
   \text{Number of student car windows smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of teacher car windows:**
   - Each teacher car has 2 windows.
   - There are 32 teacher cars.
   \[

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)

\[ \text{Total number of spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 \]

### Step 2: Sum up all the numbers.
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

So, there are 150 spools in total.

### Step 3: Determine the number of blue spools.
Candy has 45 dark blue spools and 50 dark green spools, but since the question asks for the blue spools, we will consider only the dark blue spools as they are mentioned first.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people who have voted by 16:00**.
2. **Determine how many people still haven't voted**.

Let's start with the first part:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people who have voted by 16:00

Given that by 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, let \( x \) be the number of people who were left unvoted at the beginning of the voting period (i.e., between 8:00 and 16:00). We know that 2/5 of the initial 5000 people had already voted by midday (8:00), so:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means that after 2/5 of the people had voted, 2000 people remained unvoted. Since 2/3 of these remaining people voted by 16:00, we can calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00 as follows:
\[ \text{Number of people who voted by 16:00} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times (\text{Remaining people at 16:00}) \]

Since \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people voted by 16:00, it implies that the remaining people must be less than or equal to the number of people who had voted before 8:00. Let’s denote the number of people who had voted by 16:00 as \( y \).

We also know that the number of people who had voted by 16:00 should be more than or equal to the number of people who had voted by midday plus the number of people who had yet to vote by 16:00. Therefore, if \( z \) represents the number of people who had yet to vote by 16:00, then:
\[ y \geq \frac{2}{3}z + \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 \]
\[ y \geq \frac{2}{3}z + 2000 \]

### Step 2: Determine the value of \( y \)

Now, we need to find the value of \( y \) such that \( y \) satisfies the inequality above. However, since the exact value of \( z \) isn’t provided, we can only express \( y \) in terms of \( z \):
\[ y = \frac{2}{3}z + 2000 \]

Since \( y \geq \frac{2}{3}z + 2000 \), and knowing that the number of people who had yet to vote by 16:00 must be non-negative, we conclude that:
\[ y \leq \frac{2}{3}(5000 - 2000) \]
\[ y \leq \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 \]
\[ y \leq 2000 \]

Therefore, the maximum possible value for \( y \) is 2000. This means all the remaining people voted by 16:00.

### Conclusion

All 5000 people had voted by 16:00. Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is zero.

                    question:
                    Parker , chews ; 4 pieces of . gum a day. !  A pack of gum has 15 pieces : of chewing gum ! per pack.  . How many packs of gum will ! he need : to last him 30 , days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many packs of gum Parker needs for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker consumes in one day.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum every day.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of gum needed over 30 days.
Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days:
\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} \]

\[
\text{Total pieces of gum} = 120 \text{ pieces}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of packs of gum required.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Pieces per pack}} \]
\[
\text{Number of packs} = \frac{120}{15}
\]

\[
\text{Number of packs} = 8
\]

Therefore, Parker will need **8 packs** of gum to last him 30 days.<|im_end|>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of Smores needed:**
   - Kids: 9 kids × 2 Smores per kid = 18 Smores
   - Adults: 6 adults × 1 Smore per adult = 6 Smores
   - Total Smores: 18 + 6 = 24 Smores

2. **Calculate the number of Smores one sleeve can make:**
   - Each sleeve makes enough for 8 Smores.

3. **Find out how many Smores are made from one box of Graham Crackers:**
   - Since there are 3 sleeves in a box, one box can make 3 sleeves × 8 Smores per sleeve = 24 Smores.

4. **Determine how many boxes are needed to make 24 Smores:**
   - Number of boxes required = Total Smores / Smores per box = 24 Smores / 24 Smores per box = 1 Box

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 1 Box.<|im_end|>","Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother based on the given information and then sum these ages.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine Dora's Father's Age
Given that Dora is 15 years old and her father's age is ""eight more than twice Dora's age.""

1. Calculate twice Dora's age:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]

2. Add eight to this result to find the father's age:
   \[
   30 + 8 = 38
   \]

So, Dora's father is **38** years old.

### Step 2: Determine Dora's Mother's Age
Given that Dora's mother is ""four years younger"" than Dora's father.

1. Subtract four from the father's age:
   \[
   38 - 4 = 34
   \]

So, Dora's mother is **34** years old.

### Step 3: Sum the Ages
Now, let's add up the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother.

\[
Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age = 15 + 38 + 34
\]

\[
= 15 + 72 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is **87** years.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 87.<|im_end|>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.

Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money each sibling received, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Greg found**: The total amount of money Greg found is $20.

2. **Determine the number of siblings Greg has**: Greg has three younger siblings.

3. **Calculate the equal share for each sibling**: Since the money will be split equally among the three siblings, we divide the total amount by the number of siblings.
   \[
   \text{Amount each sibling gets} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Number of siblings}} = \frac{20}{3}
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{20}{3} = 6.\overline{6} \approx 6.67
   \]
   (Note: The exact value is 6.666... or 6.67 when rounded to two decimal places.)

Therefore, each sibling receives approximately $6.67.

5. **Verify the calculation**: 
   - Total money divided by the number of siblings should give us the same result as if we had calculated it directly from the total money.
   - Let's check this: \(3 \times 6.67 = 20\).

So, each sibling gets $6.67.

### Final Answer:
Each of Greg's siblings got $\boxed{6.67}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Greg and his 3 siblings equal 3 people + 1 person = <<3+1=4>>4 people.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate Candidate B's Votes:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of votes (which we know is 100).
   - Therefore, candidate A's votes = \( 0.20 \times T \).

   Substituting \( T = 100 \):
   \[
   0.20 \times 100 = 20
   \]
   So, candidate A got 20 votes.

2. **Calculate Candidate B's Votes:**
   - Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A.
   - Since candidate A has 20 votes, candidate B’s votes can be calculated as follows:
   
     \[
     \text{B's votes} = A's\ votes + 0.50 \times A's\ votes
     \]
     
     Substituting \( A's\ votes = 20 \):

     \[
     \text{B's votes} = 20 + 0.50 \times 20 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]

   So, candidate B got 30 votes.

3. **Calculate Remaining Votes for Candidate C:**
   - Total votes = 100.
   - Votes for candidates A and B combined = 20 (A) + 30 (B) = 50 votes.
   - Votes remaining for candidate C = Total votes - Votes for A and B.

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{C's votes} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: The final answer is {50}.<|im_end|>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.

Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many apples Beck originally has**
Boris has 100 apples.
Beck has fewer apples than Boris.

Let's denote the number of apples Beck initially has as \( B \).

Since we know that Beck has fewer apples than Boris, and Boris has 100 apples, Beck must have less than 100 apples. However, we need to determine exactly how many apples Beck has. 

Given that Beck has fewer apples than Boris, let's assume the minimum possible value for Beck's apples (since he cannot have zero or more apples):

- Let's try \( B = 89 \). This means Beck has 89 apples, which is still fewer than 100 apples but more than any other integer values that would satisfy the condition.

Therefore, Beck originally has 89 apples.

**Step 2: Calculate how many apples each person has after Boris gives Beck 10 apples**

- Initially, Boris has 100 apples.
- After giving 10 apples to Beck, Boris will have \( 100 - 10 = 90 \) apples left.
- After receiving 10 apples from Boris, Beck will have \( 89 + 10 = 99 \) apples.

So, after the exchange, Beck has 99 apples, and Boris has 90 apples.

**Step 3: Determine how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris now**

- We already calculated that Beck has 99 apples.
- Boris has 90 apples.

Now, let's find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of apples Beck has} - \text{Number of apples Boris has} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 99 - 90 = 9 \]

Thus, Beck has **9 fewer apples** than Boris now.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 9.<|im_end|>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer than Boris at the start, so he started with 100 - 23 = <<100-23=77>>77 apples.
However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of water used for all the ice cubes and then subtract it from the initial amount of water.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ice cubes.
Peter makes:
- 3 giant cubes
- 7 medium cubes
- 8 small cubes

Step 2: Determine the amount of water used for each type of cube.
- Giant cubes (4 ounces each): \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces
- Medium cubes (2 ounces each): \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces
- Small cubes (\(0.5\) ounces each): \(8 \times 0.5 = 4\) ounces

Step 3: Sum up the total water used.
Total water used = Water from giant cubes + Water from medium cubes + Water from small cubes
\[12 + 14 + 4 = 30\] ounces

Step 4: Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water.
Initial amount of water = 32 ounces
Remaining water = Initial amount - Total water used
\[32 - 30 = 2\] ounces

Therefore, Peter has **2 ounces** of water left. The final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   
2. **Relate Steven's Books to Alice's Books:**
   According to the problem, Alice has ""6 more"" books than Steven. Therefore, if \( A \) represents the number of books Alice has, we can write:
   \[
   A = S + 6
   \]

3. **Relate Clara's Books to Steven's Books:**
   Clara has ""two times as many books as Steven"". So, if \( C \) represents the number of books Clara has, we can write:
   \[
   C = 2S
   \]

4. **Use the Given Information for Clara’s Books:**
   We know that Clara has 20 books. Using the equation from above:
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   This means Steven has 10 books.

5. **Calculate Alice's Books:**
   Now, using the relationship between Alice's and Steven's books:
   \[
   A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]
   Thus, Alice has 16 books.

6. **Find the Difference in Number of Books Between Clara and Alice:**
   Finally, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = C - A = 20 - 16 = 4

1. Determine the cost of one half-gallon jar.
2. Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons of full-gallon jars.
3. Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars.
4. Add both amounts together.

Step 1: Determine the cost of one half-gallon jar.
We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and that it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of gallon jar} - \$2 = \$5 - \$2 = \$3 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons of full-gallon jars.
Since each gallon jar costs $5, the total cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 gallons} = 10 \times \$5 = \$50 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars.
Since each half-gallon jar costs $3, the total cost for 16 half-gallons is:
\[ \text{Total cost for 16 half-galons} = 16 \times \$3 = \$48 \]

Step 4: Add both amounts together.
Finally, add the total cost for the 10 gallons and the 16 half-gallons:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$50 + \$48 = \$98 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10 gallons of full-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $\boxed{\$98}$.

                    question:
                    A class of 50 students has various , hobbies. 10 ? like to bake, . 5 like ? to play basketball, and , the rest . like to either play video games or : play music.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students in the class like to play video games given that the number liking music is twice the number liking basketball.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students who like baking:**
   \[
   \text{Students who like baking} = 10
   \]

3. **Define variables for the unknowns:**
   Let \( B \) be the number of students who like basketball.
   Let \( M \) be the number of students who like music.
   Let \( V \) be the number of students who like video games.

4. **Set up equations based on the information provided:**

   - The total number of students can be represented as:
     \[
     10 + B + (M - B) + V = 50
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     10 + B + M - B + V = 50
     \]
     This simplifies further to:
     \[
     10 + M + V = 50
     \]
     Therefore,
     \[
     M + V = 40
     \]

   - We also know from the problem statement that the number of students who like music is twice the number who like basketball:
     \[
     M = 2(B)
     \]

5. **Substitute \( M \) into the equation \( M + V = 40 \):**
   \[
   2B + V = 40
   \]

6. **Solve for \( V \) in terms of \( B \):**
   \[
   V = 40 - 2B
   \]

7. **Express \( M \) in terms of \( B \):**
   \[
   M = 2B
   \]

8. **Verify the consistency of these expressions:**
   Substitute \( M \) and \( V \) back into the total student equation:
   \[
   10 + B + (2B - B) + (40 - 2B) = 50
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   10 + B + B + 40 - 2B = 50
   \]
   \[
   50 = 50
   \]
   This confirms our expressions are consistent.

9. **Find the value of \( B \):**
   Since \( M = 2B \), and \( M \) must be an integer, \( B \) must be even. Given \( M \leq 10 \) (since only those who like baking have been counted), let’s check possible values for \( B \):
   - If \( B = 0 \), then \( M = 0 \) and \( V = 40 \).
   - If \( B = 2 \), then \( M = 4 \) and \( V = 32 \).
   - If \( B = 4 \), then \( M = 8 \) and \( V = 24 \).
   - If \( B = 6 \), then \( M = 12 \) and \( V = 16 \).
   - If \( B = 8 \), then \( M = 16 \) and \( V = 8 \).

10. **Calculate \( V \) for \( B = 4 \):**
    - If \( B = 4 \), then \( M = 8 \) and \( V = 32 \).

11. **Conclusion:**
    The number of students who like video games is \( 32 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many birds were scared away.
Jeremy threw a stone at the birds, causing \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the birds to fly away. There were originally 12 birds in the backyard.

\[
\text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, after being scared away, there are:

\[
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ birds left}
\]

### Step 2: Account for the additional birds joining.
After the initial scare, 20 more birds join the remaining birds. So we add these 20 birds back to the group.

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = 8 + 20 = 28
\]

### Final Answer:
There are **28** birds now in the backyard.<|im_end|>","The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.
The total number of birds remaining is 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 birds.
If 20 more birds joined, the total number of birds in the backyard will become 8 + 20 = <<8+20=28>>28 birds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boys are in each class given that there are 80 students in total across both classes and that each class has an equal number of students.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of students per class:**
   - There are 80 students in total.
   - These 80 students are split equally between two classes.
   \[
   \text{Number of students per class} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage of girls in each class:**
   - According to the problem, 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - Since each class has 40 students, we can calculate the number of girls in one class.
   \[
   \text{Number of girls per class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
   \]

3. **Find the number of boys in each class:**
   - We know the total number of students per class (40) and the number of girls per class (16).
   - Subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys per class} = \text{Total number of students per class} - \text{Number of girls per class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of boys per class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]<|im_end|>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.

2. **Adding More Slices**: Mara adds 3 more slices to the plate.
   - Current total after adding: \(2 + 3 = 5\)
3. **Tripling the Slices**: Mara triples the current number of slices on the plate.
   - New total after tripling: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
4. **Eating Slices**: Mara eats 2 slices from the plate.
   - Remaining slices after eating: \(15 - 2 = 13\)
5. **Stealing Slices**: Mara's friend steals 5 slices from the plate.
   - Final remaining slices: \(13 - 5 = 8\)

Therefore, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of grooming tasks:**
   - Dogs needing baths: 8
   - Cats needing nail clippings: 5
   - Birds needing wing trimming: 3
   - Horses needing brushing: 12
   
   Total = \( 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 \)

   Let's add them up:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13 \\
   13 + 3 = 16 \\
   16 + 12 = 28
   \]

   So, there are **28** total grooming tasks.

2. **Determine the number of days in a week:**
   There are **7** days in a week.

3. **Divide the total number of tasks by the number of days:**
   
   To find out how many tasks she can perform each day, divide the total number of tasks (28) by the number of days (7).

   \[
   \frac{28}{7} = 4
   \]

   Therefore, Melissa can groom **4** animals per day.

So, the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Each day}}<|im_end|>","Melissa has 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = <<8+5+3+12=28>>28 animals to groom over the next week.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Mark made from selling his cards, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying the packs.
Mark bought 3 packs at $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total value of all cards.
- The first pack gives him 1 card worth $4000.
- The second pack gives him 1 card worth $1000.
- There are 30 more cards in total, each worth an average of $50.

First pack's value contribution:
\[
\$4000 + \$1000 = \$5000
\]

Next pack (30 cards) contribute:
\[
30 \times \$50 = \$1500
\]

Total value of all cards:
\[
\$5000 + \$1500 = \$6500
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards to find the profit.
\[
\text{Profit} = \$6500 - \$5400 = \$1100
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Mark made from selling his cards is $\boxed{\$1100}$.

This calculation shows that despite the initial high purchase price, the higher value of the remaining cards led to a net profit for Mark.<|im_end|>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total costs at both parks and then find the difference between them.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost at the first amusement park**

- Number of adults: 2
- Cost per adult at the first park: $26
- Number of children: 2
- Cost per child at the first park: $12

Total cost at the first park = (Number of adults * Cost per adult) + (Number of children * Cost per child)

= (2 * $26) + (2 * $12)
= ($52) + ($24)
= $76

So, the total cost at the first amusement park is $76.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost at the second amusement park**

- Number of adults: 2
- Cost per adult at the second park: $14
- Number of children: 2
- Cost per child at the second park: $10

Total cost at the second park = (Number of adults * Cost per adult) + (Number of children * Cost per child)

= (2 * $14) + (2 * $10)
= ($28) + ($20)
= $48

So, the total cost at the second amusement park is $48.

**Step 3: Calculate the savings**

Savings = Total cost at the first park - Total cost at the second park

= $76 - $48
= $28

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park instead of the first one.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{28}$.<|im_end|>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

To determine how much money the vendor saves per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling tomatoes at the old price:**
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes per day.
   - At the old price of $0.50 per tomato, the daily revenue is \( 500 \times 0.50 = \$250 \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling tomatoes at the new price:**
   - At the new price of $0.40 per tomato, the daily revenue is \( 500 \times 0.40 = \$200 \).

3. **Determine the difference in daily revenue between the two prices:**
   - The difference in daily revenue is \( 250 - 200 = \$50 \).

4. **Calculate the weekly savings based on the daily difference:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly savings are \( 50 \times 7 = \$350 \).

Therefore, the vendor saves $\boxed{350}$ dollars per week.<|im_end|>","He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500

2. Use the number of marbles Sean has to find out how many marbles Carl has.
3. Use the number of marbles Carl has to find out how many marbles Cal has.
4. Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Determine how many marbles Sean has.
We know that Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 2: Use the number of marbles Sean has to find out how many marbles Carl has.
Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, if Sean has 56 marbles, then Carl has \(4 \times 56\) marbles.

\[
4 \times 56 = 224
\]

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Step 3: Use the number of marbles Carl has to find out how many marbles Cal has.
Cal has half as many marbles as Carl. So, if Carl has 224 marbles, then Cal has \(\frac{224}{2}\) marbles.

\[
\frac{224}{2} = 112
\]

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Step 4: Add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.
Now we add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have:

\[
224 + 112 = 336
\]

Therefore, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined is 336.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional groups are required to achieve the total number of groups specified.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Determine the current number of groups:**
   - There are currently 6 groups.
   
2. **Calculate the remaining number of groups needed:**
   - The total desired number of groups is 12.
   - Therefore, the number of additional groups needed = Total desired groups - Current groups.
     \[
     \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 - 6 = 6
     \]

3. **Verify that these groups can fit within the given student capacity:**
   - We have 54 students in total.
   - Each group consists of an equal number of students.
   - Since there are already 6 groups, each group has \( \frac{54}{6} = 9 \) students.

Thus, it is clear that the current setup allows for exactly 6 groups with 9 students per group.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 0}}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented over a period of four weeks. Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate weekly rentals for weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- Number of days per week = 5
- Chairs rented per weekday = 60
- Weekly rentals for weekdays = \( 5 \times 60 = 300 \)

### Step 2: Calculate weekly rentals for weekends (Saturday and Sunday)
- Number of days per weekend = 2
- Chairs rented per weekend day = 100
- Weekly rentals for weekends = \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)

### Step 3: Total weekly rentals
- Total weekly rentals = Weekday rentals + Weekend rentals
- Total weekly rentals = \( 300 + 200 = 500 \)

### Step 4: Calculate monthly rentals
- There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
- Monthly rentals = Total weekly rentals \(\times\) Months in a year (considering one year as 12 months).
- Monthly rentals = \( 500 \times 4 = 2000 \)

### Step 5: Calculate total rentals over two 4-week months
- Two 4-week months = \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) months
- Total rentals over 8 months = Monthly rentals \(\times\) Number of months
- Total rentals over 8 months = \( 2000 \times 8 = 16000 \)

### Final Answer
Candy will be able to rent out a total of **16,000 chairs** over two 4-week months.<|im_end|>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps carefully:

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther initially has 48 bananas.
   
2. **Bananas stolen by Arnold**: Arnold steals half of the bananas. 
   - Half of 48 is \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \) bananas.
   - After stealing, Gunther has \( 48 - 24 = 24 \) bananas left.

3. **Additional bananas added by Gunther on the second day**:
   - Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   - Now Gunther has \( 24 + 25 = 49 \) bananas.

4. **Bananas stolen by Arnold on the third day**:
   - Arnold steals some bananas from Gunther's pile.
   - We know he stole 12 bananas.

5. **Final number of bananas after the theft on the third day**:
   - Subtracting 12 from 49 gives us \( 49 - 12 = 37 \).

So, Gunther found and counted 37 bananas in the pile. 

Therefore, the final answer is:  
\[
\boxed{37}
\]<|im_end|>","Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
Arnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.
Starting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.
Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total monthly cost:**
   - The total monthly cost for electricity is $100.

2. **Determine the number of roommates sharing the cost:**
   - There are 4 roommates.

3. **Divide the total monthly cost by the number of roommates:**
   - To find out how much each roommate pays in one month, we divide the total monthly cost by the number of roommates.
     \[
     \text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} = \frac{\$100}{4}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} = \$25
     \]

4. **Calculate the yearly cost for each roommate:**
   - To find the yearly cost, we multiply the monthly cost per roommate by the number of months in a year (which is 12).
     \[
     \text{Yearly Cost per Roommate} = \text{Monthly Cost per Roommate} \times 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{Yearly Cost per Roommate} = \$25 \times 12

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has after receiving the replacements.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Initial Inventory:
- **Glasses**: Jeff initially sent out 8 dozen glasses.
- **Plates**: Jeff initially sent out 4 dozen plates.

#### Calculating Total Initial Quantity:
- Each dozen contains 12 items (since 1 dozen = 12).
  
  - **Glasses**:
    \[
    8 \text{ dozen} \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
    \]

  - **Plates**:
    \[
    4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
    \]

#### Replacements Received:
- **Broken Glasses**: 10 glasses broken
- **Returned Plates**: 6 plates returned

#### Calculating Remaining Glasses and Plates After Replacements:
- **Remaining Glasses**:
  Since Jeff received no additional glasses, his remaining number of glasses remains the same.
  
  \[
  96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining Plates**:
  Jeff received 6 plates back but did not replace any of them.

  \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many stickers each person has initially**.
2. **Calculate how many stickers Lorraine trades away**.
3. **Calculate how many stickers remain after the trade**.
4. **Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the first trade**.
5. **Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the second trade**.
6. **Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the third trade**.
7. **Sum up all received buttons to get the total number of buttons Lorraine ends up with**.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Initial Sticker Count
- Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
- Lorraine also starts with 40 large stickers.

### Step 2: Calculate how many stickers Lorraine trades away
Lorraine decides to trade 90% of her small stickers and 50% of her large stickers.

- Number of small stickers traded = \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)
- Number of large stickers traded = \( 40 \times 0.50 = 20 \)

Total stickers traded away = Small stickers + Large stickers traded = \( 27 + 20 = 47 \).

### Step 3: Calculate remaining stickers
- Remaining small stickers = \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) 
- Remaining large stickers = \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

### Step 4: Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the first trade
- Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, the value of 20 large stickers is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons} \]

So, Lorraine receives 60 buttons from the first trade.

### Step 5: Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the second trade
- Since each small sticker is worth 1/3 of a large button (or equivalently, 3 small stickers), the value of 3 small stickers is:
\[ 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \text{ large button} \]
- The value of 30 small stickers is then:
\[ 30 \times 1 = 30 \text{ large buttons} \]

So, Lorraine receives 30 buttons from the second trade.

### Step 6: Calculate how many buttons Lorraine receives from the third trade
Since she has no more large stickers left to trade, she will not receive any more large buttons.

### Step 7: Sum up all received buttons
Total buttons received = Buttons from first trade + Buttons from second trade
= \( 60 + 30 = 90 \)

Therefore, Lorraine ends up with **90 buttons**. 

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 90}

To determine how many matches Joey played in total over the course of one week, let's break down the information provided:

### Step 1: Determine the number of matches played on Saturday.
- According to the problem, Joey played ""double the number"" of matches on Saturday compared to Monday.
- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.

So, the number of matches played on Saturday = 2 * 2 = **4** matches.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of matches played on the days specified.
- **Monday**: 2 matches
- **Friday**: 1 match

Total for these two days = 2 + 1 = **3** matches.

### Step 3: Sum up all the matches from the given days.
- Matches played on Monday: 2
- Matches played on Friday: 1
- Matches played on Saturday: 4 (as calculated above)

Total matches played in one week = 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = **7** matches.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of people on the council**: 33
2. **Votes cast for the new regulation**: Twice as many as those against.
3. Let \( x \) be the number of votes that were against.

Given that the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we can express the number of votes in favor as \( 2x \).

Since these two quantities represent all the votes cast (both for and against), their sum must equal the total number of votes cast on the council:

\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Simplify this equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} \]
\[ x = 11 \]

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation.

Next, calculate the number of votes in favor using the relationship between the votes cast for and against:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 \]
\[ 2x = 22 \]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22}}

Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of students needing each shirt size.
- **Extra Small (ES)**: There are 11 students who need size ES.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students needing sizes Small (S) and Medium (M).
- **Small (S)**: Since there are twice as many students needing S as those needing ES:
\[ \text{Number of S} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

- **Medium (M)**: The number of M students is four less than the number of S students:
\[ \text{Number of M} = 22 - 4 = 18 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students needing sizes Large (L), Extra-Large (XL), and Super-Large (SL).
- **Large (L)**: There are half as many students needing L as those needing M:
\[ \text{Number of L} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

- **Extra Large (XL)**: There are six more students needing XL than those needing L:
\[ \text{Number of XL} = 9 + 6 = 15 \]

- **Super Large (SL)**: Since the total number of students is 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75, and we have already accounted for all these sizes, there are no students left for SL.

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of students requiring shirts.
\[ \text{Total Students} = 11 (\text{ES}) + 22 (\text{S}) + 18 (\text{M}) + 9 (\text{L}) + 15 (\text{XL}) \]
\[ \text{Total Students} = 75 \]

### Conclusion:
Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts for her preschool students.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 75.<|im_end|>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the discount:**
   - The discount rate is given as 5%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.05).
   - Multiply the original price by the discount rate to find the discount amount.

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**
   - Subtract the calculated discount amount from the original price to get the final price after the discount.

Let's perform these calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate the Discount Amount
- Original Price = $140
- Discount Rate = 5%

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$140 \times 0.05 \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$7 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Discount from the Original Price
- Final Price After Discount = Original Price - Discount Amount

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of songs per playlist**: 
   - We know that there are 300 songs in one playlist.

2. **Calculate the total number of songs across all playlists**:
   - John has 20 playlists.
   - Therefore, the total number of songs = (number of songs per playlist) × (number of playlists)

\[ \text{Total songs} = 300 \times 20 = 6000 \]

3. **Find out how many hours all the songs together take**:
   - Each song is 10 hours long.
   - So, if we add up all the songs, they would be 10 hours each multiplied by the total number of songs.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people think horse #12 will win the big race. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of people who initially think horse #2 will win.
Given that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #2 will win} = 0.20 \times 50 \]

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #2 will win} = 10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people who remain after accounting for those thinking horse #2 will win.
\[ \text{Remaining people} = 50 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Remaining people} = 40 \]

### Step 3: Determine the percentage of the remaining people who think horse #7 will win.
Given that 60% of the remaining people (after accounting for those thinking horse #2) think horse #7 will win:

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #7 will win} = 0.60 \times 40 \]

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #7 will win} = 24 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people who do not think either horse #2 or #7 will win.
\[ \text{People considering other horses} = 40 - 24 \]
\[ \text{People considering other horses} = 16 \]

### Step 5: Determine the percentage of the remaining people who think horse #12 will win.
Given that the rest of the remaining people think horse #12 will win:

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #12 will win} = 0.80 \times 16 \]

\[ \text{Number of people thinking horse #12 will win} = 12.8 \]

Since the number of people must be an integer, we round 12.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 13.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **13**.<|im_end|>","20% of 50 people are pulling for horse #2 so that's .20*50 = <<.20*50=10>>10 people

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranian dogs:**
   - We know that one-third of all Pomeranian dogs are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

Let \( x \) be the total number of Pomeranian dogs.

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 6
\]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**

Multiply both sides by 3 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 6 \times 3
\]

\[
x = 18
\]

So, there are 18 Pomeranian dogs in total.

3. **Determine the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Therefore, if \( y \) is the total number of puppies, then:

\[
\frac{2}{3}y = 18
\]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**

Divide both sides by \(\frac{2}{3}\) (which is equivalent to multiplying by \(\frac{3}{2}\)):

\[
y = 18 \div \frac{2}{3}
\]

\[
y = 18 \times \frac{3}{2}
\]

\[
y = 27
\]

Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies in total.

5. **Verify the information given:**
   - The number of Pomeranian puppies should be \(\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18\).
   - Since there are 6 Pomeranian girls among them, it confirms our calculations.

Thus, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate how much money Ava gives to Jayden:**
   - Ava has an allowance of $90.
   - She gives half of it to Jayden for helping him buy the camera.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount given by Ava} = \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jayden now has after receiving the allowance:**
   - Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures.
   - He receives $45 from his sister Ava.

   \[
   \text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the cost of the camera from the total money Jayden has:**
   - The camera costs $200.
   - Subtracting this cost from the total money Jayden has.

   \[
   \text{Money left after buying the camera} = 115 - 200 = -85 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the result is negative, it means Jayden doesn't have enough money to buy the camera at all. 

Therefore, Jayden needs more money to buy the camera.

**Final Answer:** Jayden needs **more than $85** to buy the camera. Since he only has $115, he would still be short of $26 ($115 - $200). Therefore, the correct interpretation should be ""Jayden needs more than $85"" to cover the cost of the camera. However, if we strictly follow the format, the final answer indicating he still lacks is incorrect because he actually has more than needed but not enough to purchase. So, the final clear indication based on the calculation would be that he **needs more than $85**.<|im_end|>","Ava gave $90/2 = $<<90/2=45>>45 to Jayden.

                    question:
                    Rob, Royce, and Pedro ? are contractors ; getting ready ; to put ! a new roof on three homes. ; If the three homes ? will . need 250 ; cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 : of the second, ! and the : third ? needing double the first. How many ? cases : of shingles will , the third house need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of shingles needed for all three houses.
- Let \( H_1 \) represent the amount of shingles needed for the first house.
- The second house needs half as much as the first, so \( H_2 = \frac{H_1}{2} \).
- The third house needs double the amount of the first, so \( H_3 = 2 \times H_1 \).

Given that the total number of shingles needed for all three houses is 250 cases, we can write the equation:
\[ H_1 + H_2 + H_3 = 250 \]

Substitute \( H_2 \) and \( H_3 \):
\[ H_1 + \frac{H_1}{2} + 2H_1 = 250 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ H_1 + \frac{H_1}{2} + 2H_1 = 250 \]
\[ H_1 + \frac{H_1}{2} + \frac{4H_1}{2} = 250 \]
\[ H_1 + \frac{5H_1}{2} = 250 \]

Multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 2H_1 + 5H_1 = 500 \]
\[ 7H_1 = 500 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ H_1 = \frac{500}{7} \approx 71.43 \text{ (approximately)} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the exact amounts for each house.
Since \( H_1 \approx 71.43 \), let's calculate the other two values.

For the first house (\( H_1 \)):
\[ H_1 = 71.43 \]

For the second house (\( H_2 \)):
\[ H_2 = \frac{H_1}{2} = \frac{71.43}{2} \approx 35.72 \]

For the third house (\( H_3 \)):
\[ H_3 = 2 \times H_1 = 2 \times 71.43 \approx 142.86 \]

### Step 3: Confirm the sum matches the total.
Let's add up these amounts to ensure they match the given total:
\[ H_1 + H_2 + H_3 = 71.43 + 35.72 + 142.86 \approx 250 \]

Thus, our calculations confirm that the total number of shingles needed is indeed 250 cases.

### Conclusion:
The third house will need approximately **142.86** cases of shingles. Given the context of roofing materials, it would be more practical to round this value to the nearest whole number, but if precision is required, the answer remains:
{The final answer is}
\[ \boxed{143} \] cases of shingles.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fruits George has in total given that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

1. **Determine the number of pears George has:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of bananas.
   - According to the problem, George has 45% more pears than bananas.
   - Therefore, if George has 200 bananas, then the number of pears can be calculated as follows:

\[ P = B + (0.45 \times B) \]

2. **Substitute the known value for bananas into the equation:**

\[ P = 200 + (0.45 \times 200) \]

3. **Calculate the number of pears:**

\[ P = 200 + 90 \]
\[ P = 290 \]

So, George has 290 pears.

4. **Determine the total number of fruits:**
   - The total number of fruits is the sum of bananas and pears.

\[ Total Fruits = B + P \]

5. **Substitute the values for bananas and pears into the equation:**

1. **Determine the total amount Marissa spent:**
   - Marissa started with $80.
   - She spent $20 on the ball.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent = $80 (initial) - $20 (ball) = $60.

2. **Calculate how much money Marissa has left after buying the ball:**
   - After spending $20 on the ball, Marissa has $80 - $20 = $60 remaining.

3. **Identify the cost per candy bar:**
   - Each candy bar costs $5.

4. **Calculate the number of candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money:**
   - To find out how many candy bars Marissa can afford, we divide the remaining money by the price of one candy bar.
     \[
     \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Price per candy bar}} = \frac{60}{5}

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine how many books Ahmed reads in one hour.
Given that Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, we can set up a ratio:

- Let \( E \) represent the number of books Ezra reads in one hour.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed reads in one hour.

From the information provided:
\[ E = 2A \]

We also know that Ezra has already read 300 books this hour. So:
\[ E = 300 \]

Using the ratio from Step 1, we can find out how many books Ahmed reads:
\[ 300 = 2A \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} \]
\[ A = 150 \]

So, Ahmed reads 150 books in one hour.

### Step 2: Calculate how many books Ahmed will read after reading 150 more books.
Ahmed decides to read 150 more books. Therefore, the total number of books Ahmed will read is:
\[ 150 + 150 \]
\[ 300 \]

### Step 3: Add the number of books Ezra and Ahmed have read together.
Ezra has already read 300 books, and Ahmed will read an additional 300 books. Thus, the total number of books read by both is:
\[ 300 (Ezra's books) + 300 (Ahmed's books) \]
\[ 600 \]

### Final Answer:

                    question:
                    Tanya : is teaching at ? school. She : earns $15 for every hour and an , additional . $5 per day : if she teaches ? more than : 3 . classes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many classes Tanya teaches in total over the two days.
- **Monday**: Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours.
- **Wednesday**: Tanya teaches 2 classes.

Total number of classes = 4 + 2 = 6 classes.

### Step 2: Calculate the daily earnings based on the number of classes taught.
- For each class, Tanya earns $15 plus an additional amount that depends on whether she teaches more than 3 classes or not.
  
Let's denote the additional amount as \( A \).

Given that she earns $5 extra for teaching more than 3 classes, we can express her total earning from one class as:
\[ E = 15 + A \]

Since there is no information about \( A \), we will assume \( A \) does not affect the calculation directly (i.e., it doesn't change the basic hourly rate). Therefore, we only consider the base hourly wage.

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the number of classes taught.
- **Daily earnings**:
  - **Monday**:
    - Number of classes = 4
    - Hourly wage per class = $15
    - Total earnings for Monday = \( 4 \times \$15 = \$60 \)

- **Tuesday**:
  - Number of classes = 2
  - Hourly wage per class = $15
  - Total earnings for Tuesday = \( 2 \times \$15 = \$30 \)

- **Wednesday**:
  - Number of classes = 2
  - Hourly wage per class = $15
  - Total earnings for Wednesday = \( 2 \times \$15 = \$30 \)

### Step 4: Sum up the earnings for all days.
- **Total earnings**:
  - **Monday** earnings: $60
  - **Tuesday** earnings: $30
  - **Wednesday** earnings: $30

Total earnings = \( \$60 + \$30 + \$30 = \$120 \)

### Conclusion:
Tanya earned a total of $120 for these two days of teaching.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $120.<|im_end|>","Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.
She earned therefore 7 hours * $15/hour = $<<7*15=105>>105.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total sales for vanilla scents:**
   - Vanilla scents available initially: 4
   - Number sold in one day: 5
   - Total sales = 4 (initial) + 5 (sold that day) = 9 vanilla scents

2. **Calculate total sales for fruity scents:**
   - Fruity scents available initially: 8
   - Number sold in one day: 2
   - Total sales = 8 (initial) + 2 (sold that day) = 10 fruity scents

3. **Determine the difference between vanilla and fruity scents:**
   - Difference = Vanilla sales - Fruity sales
   - Difference = 9 (vanilla) - 10 (fruity)

4. **Final calculation:**
   - Difference = 9 - 10 = -1

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} -1. This indicates that fewer vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents.<|im_end|>","The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per ear of corn that Bennet should sell in order to achieve his goal of making $135.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate the revenue from selling eggplants.
Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each.

\[ \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = \$60 \]

#### 2. Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $135.
Subtract the revenue from eggplants from the target total.

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 135 - 60 = \$75 \]

#### 3. Calculate the number of ears of corn that need to be sold.
Bennet has 25 ears of corn.

#### 4. Set up an equation to find the price per ear of corn.
Let \( p \) be the price per ear of corn.

\[ 25p = 75 \]

#### 5. Solve for \( p \).
Divide both sides by 25 to isolate \( p \).

\[ p = \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

### Conclusion:
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to achieve his goal of making $135.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is The price per ear of corn that Bennet should sell is **$3**.<|im_end|>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total available time for both days.
- Saturday: 7 hours
- Sunday: 5 hours
- Total time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

### Step 2: Determine the amount of time spent on reading.
She spends 3 hours reading.

### Step 3: Subtract the time spent on reading from the total time.
Remaining time after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

### Step 4: Divide the remaining time equally between playing video games and watching soccer.
Since she divides the remaining time between two activities (video games and soccer), we divide 9 hours by 2.

Time spent on video games = Time spent on soccer = 9 / 2 = 4.5 hours

### Step 5: Verify that the time spent on video games equals half of the remaining time.
Total time divided by 2 should equal 4.5 hours, which is correct.

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer.
Total time = 12 hours
Time spent on soccer = 4.5 hours

Percentage of weekend spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total time) * 100
= (4.5 / 12) * 100 ≈ 37.5%

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is approximately 37.5%.<|im_end|>","She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12

After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Brandon.
- Anthony has 50 pencils initially.
- He gives half of them to Brandon.

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate how many pencils are left after giving some to Brandon.
- Subtract the number of pencils given to Brandon from the total number of pencils Anthony originally had.

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after giving to Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

Step 3: Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Charlie.
- Anthony then gives three-fifths of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Step 4: Calculate how many pencils are left after giving some to Charlie.
- Subtract the number of pencils given to Charlie from the remaining pencils.

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after giving to Charlie} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

Therefore, Anthony keeps 10 pencils.

The final answer is: The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils

Thus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.
Therefore, Anthony kept 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 pencils.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long Jack was gone from his home, we need to consider both the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven.
Jack drives from his home to the museum and then returns to his home. The distance between his home and the museum is given as 150 miles.

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Speed}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Since he travels at 75 mph:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 2 \times 150 \text{ miles}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the total distance into hours.
We know that speed (75 mph) equals distance (300 miles). We can find the time taken for this trip using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it takes him 4 hours to drive from his home to the museum and back.

### Step 3: Determine the total time spent on all activities.
Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

\[
\text{Total Time Spent} = 4 \text{ hours (driving)} + 6 \text{ hours (at the museum)}
\]

\[
\text{Total Time Spent} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion:
Jack was gone from his home for a total of 10 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: 10 hours.<|im_end|>","He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total number of wheels needed:**

   - For cars: 
     \[
     57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels}
     \]
   
   - For motorcycles:
     \[
     73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels}
     \]

   - Total number of wheels needed:
     \[
     228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels}
     \]

2. **Subtract the total number of wheels from the available wheels:**
   
   - Number of wheels available: 650
   - Number of wheels used: 374
   
   - Wheels left after assembly:
     \[
     650 - 374 = 276 \text{ wheels}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 276 wheels remaining.<|im_end|>","The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels

Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels
The number of wheels left in the bag will be 650 wheels – 374 wheels = <<650-374=276>>276 wheels

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the amount of the discount**
- The original price of the laptop is $1000.
- A 20% discount means we need to calculate 20% of $1000.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the discount amount**
- Simplify the calculation:

\[ 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200 \]

So, the discount on the laptop is $200.

**Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price**
- To find out how much you have to pay after applying the discount, subtract the discount amount from the original price.

\[ \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 \]

**Step 4: Perform the subtraction**

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

To determine how much Mike will spend on replacing his movie collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of movies that are not in series:**
   - Total number of movies = 600.
   - Number of movies in series = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \).
   - Number of non-series movies = \( 600 - 200 = 400 \).

2. **Determine the cost of the series movies:**
   - Since a series includes all its individual movies, it would be cheaper to buy them separately than individually because they are bundled.
   - Let's calculate the total cost of the series movies.
     - Cost per movie in series = $6.
     - Total cost for series movies = \( 200 \times 6 = $1200 \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the older movies:**
   - The cost of an older movie = $5.
   - Number of older movies = \( 40\% \) of the remaining movies.
     - Remaining movies after excluding series movies = \( 400 \).
     - Number of older movies = \( 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \).
     - Total cost for older movies = \( 160 \times 5 = $800 \).

4. **Sum up the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of series movies + Cost of older movies.
     - Total cost = $1200 (series movies) + $800 (older movies) = $2000.

Therefore, replacing Mike's movies costs him $2000.

\text{Total cost of peaches} = \$2.00 \times 6 = \$12.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of plums
- Price per pound of plums = $1.00
- Number of pounds of plums picked = 8

\[
\text{Total cost of plums} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of plums} = \$1.00 \times 8 = \$8.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of apricots
- Price per pound of apricots = $3.00
- Number of pounds of apricots picked = 6

\[
\text{Total cost of apricots} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of apricots} = \$3.00 \times 6 = \$18.00
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs to find the total amount spent

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of peaches} + \text{Total cost of plums} + \text{Total cost of apricots}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total amount Winston spent on his fruits is $\boxed{\$38.00}$.

Note: Since the question specifies ""peaches"" instead of ""plums"", it seems there was an error in the initial conditions provided (the price of plums should be $1.00 per pound). However, if we follow the correct conditions as specified, the calculation would result in $38.00.<|im_end|>","He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches
He bought 8 pounds of plums that are $1.00 per pound so he spent 8*1 = $<<8*1=8.00>>8.00 on plums
He bought 6 pounds of apricots that are $3.00 per pound so he spent 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 on apricots
That day, he spent 12+8+18 = $<<12+8+18=38.00>>38.00 on fruit

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance driven
- Average speed driving = 50 mph
- Total time driving = 6 hours

Total distance driven = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the average hiking speed
- Hiking speed is given as 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of their driving speed is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) mph.

Hiking speed = Driving speed - 5 mph
\[ \text{Hiking speed} = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ mph} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance hiked
- Total time hiking = 1.5 hours
- Average hiking speed = 20 mph

Total distance hiked = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Combine the distances to find the total trip length
Total trip length = Distance driven + Distance hiked
\[ \text{Total trip length} = 300 + 30 = 330 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{330}
\]<|im_end|>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.
Hence, their average speed hiking was 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 miles per hour.
So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine who is better at the new video game, we need to calculate both players' total scores based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Ava's Score:
1. **Points from Enemies Jumped:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - Points per enemy = 10 points.
   - Number of enemies jumped by Ava = \( 8 \) (Emma’s number) + 8 = 16.
   - Total points from enemies = \( 16 \times 10 = 160 \).

2. **Points from Berries Collected:**
   - Points per berry = 5 points.
   - Number of berries collected by Ava = 3 more than Emma.
   - Let's assume Emma collected \( x \) berries.
   - Then Ava collected \( x + 3 \) berries.
   - Total points from berries = \( (x + 3) \times 5 \).
   - Since the problem doesn't specify how many berries Emma collected, let's denote this as \( E \), so Ava collected \( E + 3 \).

3. **Points Lost Due to Time:**
   - Points lost per second = 30 points.
   - Time lost by Ava = 4 seconds.
   - Total points lost due to time = \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \).

Now, combine all these into Ava's total score:
\[ \text{Ava's Total Score} = 160 + [5(E + 3)] - 120 \]
Since \( E \) is not specified, we can simplify it further without knowing \( E \):
\[ \text{Ava's Total Score} = 160 + 5E + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's Total Score} = 160 + 5E + 15 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Ava's Total Score} = 175 + 5E \]

#### Emma's Score:
1. **Points from Enemies Jumped:**
   - Points per enemy = 10 points.
   - Number of enemies jumped by Emma = \( x \).
   - Total points from enemies = \( 10x \).

2. **Points from Berries Collected:**
   - Points per berry = 5 points.
   - Number of berries collected by Emma = \( x \).
   - Total points from berries = \( 5x \).

3. **Points Lost Due to Time:**
   - Points lost per second = 30 points.
   - Time lost by Emma = 4 seconds.
   - Total points lost due to time = \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \).

Now, combine all these into Emma's total score:
\[ \text{Emma's Total Score} = 10x + 5x - 120 \]
\[ \text{Emma's Total Score} = 15x - 120 \]

### Difference Between Their Scores:
Since we don't have specific values for \( x \), we cannot directly compute the exact difference in their scores. However, if we had the value of \( x \), we could substitute it to find out which player scored higher.

Given that the problem does not provide enough information about the number of berries Emma collected or any other details, we cannot determine the difference conclusively. Therefore, the final answer would be dependent on those missing details.

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{\text{Dependent on the number of berries Emma collected}}
\]<|im_end|>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per pizza among the remaining two pizzas that have equal costs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the first two pizzas:**
   The first two pizzas cost $30 each.

2. **Subtract the cost of these two pizzas from the total cost:**
   Total cost = $64
   Cost of the first two pizzas = $30 + $30 = $60
   
   Remaining total = $64 - $60 = $4

3. **Determine the cost of one of the last two pizzas:**
   Let the cost of one of the last two pizzas be \( x \).

4. **Since all three pizzas have the same cost, set up an equation:**
   \[
   x + x = \text{Total cost of one last pizza}
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x = 4
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

So, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is $2.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{2}$<|im_end|>","The other two pizzas cost 64-30 = <<64-30=34>>34 dollars.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of rides per usual day:**
   - They ride their bikes thrice a day.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of rides in one usual day:**
   \[
   3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ usual days} = 15 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. **Adjust the rides based on the unusual days:**
   - On two out of five days, they ride twice as much (i.e., twice the usual amount).
   
4. **Calculate the total rides on the usual days:**
   - Since there are 5 usual days, we multiply the usual daily rides by 5:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides/usual day} \times 5 \text{ usual days} = 75 \text{ rides}
     \]
   
5. **Calculate the additional rides on the unusual days:**
   - For each of these two days, they ride twice the usual amount:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 = 30 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
     Since there are two such days, the total additional rides are:
     \[
     30 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ rides}
     \]

6. **Sum up all the rides over the entire week:**
   - Add the regular rides to the extra rides from the unusual days:
     \[
     75 \text{ rides} + 60 \text{ rides} = 135 \text{ rides}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Bob starts with 7 fish in his pond.
   - Out of these, 3 are orange and 4 are white.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - Bob decides to go to the pet store to get more fish.
   - At the pet store, he sees a mix of white and orange fish but only gets 17 fish total from the store.

3. **Understanding the Store's Offer:**
   - The store offers a mix of both colors but only specifies the number of fish per color.
   - Let's denote the number of orange fish bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish bought as \( y \).

4. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - From the information given, we know that \( x + y = 17 \).
   - We also know that before going to the store, Bob had 3 oranges and 4 whites, making a total of 7 fish initially (since they are all mixed together).

5. **Finding the Number of White Fish Bought:**
   - After buying more fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
   - Therefore, if \( x \) is the number of orange fish bought, then \( 2x \) must be the number of white fish bought because there are twice as many oranges as white ones.

6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Since \( x + y = 17 \), and knowing that \( y \) represents the number of white fish bought, we can substitute \( y \) with \( 17 - x \).
   - Given that \( x = 2y \) (because \( x \) is the number of oranges and \( 2x \) is the number of white fish bought), we can write:
     \[
     x = 2(17 - x)
     \]
   - Solving this equation:
     \[
     x = 34 - 2x \\
     3x = 34 \\
     x = 17 / 3 \\
     x = 17/3
     \]

7. **Calculating the Total Number of White Fish Bought:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of orange fish bought, and \( x = 17/3 \):
     \[
     \text{Total white fish bought} = 2x = 2 \times \frac{17}{3} = \frac{34}{3}
     \]

8. **Final Calculation:**
   - Bob originally had 4 white fish, and he buys an additional 17 - 4 = 13 white fish.
   - Thus, the total number of white fish after buying more is:
     \[
     4 + \frac{34}{3} = \frac{12}{3} + \frac{34}{3} = \frac{46}{3} \approx 15.33
     \]

Therefore, Bob bought approximately 15.33 white fish at the store.

**The final answer is:** {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.

3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Andy drives in a week.
Andy drives to work and back home five days a week. Therefore, the round trip distance is twice the one-way distance.

- One-way distance = 5 miles
- Round trip distance = 2 × 5 miles = 10 miles

Since Andy works 5 days a week:
Total weekly mileage = Round trip distance × Number of working days
= 10 miles/day × 5 days/week
= 50 miles/week

### Step 2: Determine the total cost of gasoline consumed per week.
We know that Andy's car has an average fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG).

First, calculate the total gallons of gasoline used in a week:
Total gallons of gasoline used = Total weekly mileage / Fuel efficiency
= 50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gal
= 5 gallons/week

Next, multiply the total gallons by the price per gallon to find the total cost:
Total cost = Total gallons of gasoline used × Price per gallon
= 5 gallons/week × $3/gal
= $15/week

Therefore, Andy’s car consumes approximately **$15** per week at its current fuel prices.<|im_end|>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days

If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

A quarter (25 cents) = $0.25

**Step 2: Calculate the total value of the quarters**
Carrie has 140 quarters.
Total value of quarters = 140 × $0.25

**Step 3: Calculate the total value of the tens**
Carrie has ten twenties.
Total value of twenties = 10 × $20

**Step 4: Determine how much Carrie spends on the lunch**
Carrie spends 3/5 of the twenties on the lunch.
Amount spent on twenties = 3/5 × $200

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining value in twenties after spending**
Remaining value in twenties = Total value of twenties - Amount spent on twenties

= $80

**Step 6: Calculate the total amount of money spent on the lunch**
Total amount spent on lunch = Value of quarters + Remaining value in twenties

                    question:
                    ! Samwell owns an appliances : store. For this week, ? one-fourth : of ; their ; sales are smart TVs, one-eighth are analog ! TVs, and the rest are OLED TVs. If they were able to ? sell a total of 40 TVs, how ! many OLED TVs ; were ; they able ? to ? sell?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of OLED TVs sold based on the given percentages for smart TVs and analog TVs.

1. **Calculate the percentage of smart TVs:**
   - One-fourth (1/4) of the total sales are smart TVs.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of analog TVs:**
   - One-eighth (1/8) of the total sales are analog TVs.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 100\% = 12.5\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of OLED TVs:**
   - The remaining sales are OLED TVs.
   - Total percentage should be 100%, so:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of OLED TVs} = 100\% - (\text{Percentage of smart TVs} + \text{Percentage of analog TVs})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of OLED TVs} = 100\% - (25\% + 12.5\%) = 100\% - 37.5\% = 62.5\%
   \]

4. **Determine the number of OLED TVs sold:**
   - Given that the total number of TVs sold is 40.
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = \left(\frac{\text{Total TVs}}{100}\right) \times \text{Percentage of OLED TVs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs} = \left(\frac{40}{100}\right) \times 62.5\% = 0.4 \times 62.5 = 25
   \]

### Conclusion:
Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]<|im_end|>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money John needs after accounting for the amount he already has ($50) and the fact that his application will cover half the total cost of the trip.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the total cost of the trip:**
   The total cost of the trip is given as $300.

2. **Calculate the amount covered by the school:**
   Since the school covers half the cost, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered} = \frac{\$300}{2} = \$150
   \]

3. **Subtract the amount covered from the total cost:**
   To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount covered by the school from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Additional amount needed} = \$300 - \$150 = \$150
   \]

4. **Add the amount John already has to the additional amount needed:**
   Finally, we add the amount John already has ($50) to the additional amount needed ($150):
   \[
   \text{Total money John still needs} = \$50 + \$150 = \$200
   \]

Therefore, John still needs $\boxed{200}$ dollars in addition to what he already has.<|im_end|>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.
In total John has covered 150 + 50 = $<<150+50=200>>200 for his trip
Therefore, John needs 300 - 200 = $<<300-200=100>>100 more for the trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the desired temperature for the pipes not to freeze**:
   - The pipes will freeze at temperatures below 32°F.

2. **Calculate the difference between the current indoor temperature and the freezing point**:
   - Current indoor temperature: 45°F
   - Freezing point: 32°F
   - Difference = 45°F - 32°F = 13°F

3. **Identify the heating effect provided by one log**:
   - Each log provides a heating effect of 5°F.

4. **Calculate the total number of logs needed to achieve the required heating effect**:
   - Total heating needed = 13°F (to avoid freezing)
   - Number of logs needed = \(\frac{13°F}{5°F \text{ per log}}\)

Let’s perform the division:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{13}{5} \]

Performing this calculation gives us:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = 2.6 \]

Since Carson cannot use a fraction of a log, he must round up to ensure that the pipes do not freeze. Therefore, he would need 3 logs to be safe.

So, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 3 logs.<|im_end|>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees

Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of groups:**
   - There are 90 people who need to be divided into groups.
   - Each group consists of 9 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of groups is \( \frac{90}{9} = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the number of groups each person belongs to:**
   - Since there are 10 groups and 90 people, we can calculate the number of people per group as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of people per group} = \frac{90}{10} = 9
     \]

3. **Verify that the groups have an equal number of people:**
   - Each group indeed has 9 people (as calculated above), so the distribution is correct.

4. **Determine how many groups brought back shells:**
   - According to the problem, 3/5 of these groups each had more than one member.
   - This means \( \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \) groups will each have more than one member.

5. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each such group:**
   - Each group brings back 2 seashells.

6. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by all such groups:**
   - The total number of seashells from these 6 groups is:
     \[
     6 \times 2 = 12
     \]

7. **Add the seashells brought by the remaining groups:**
   - There are 4 groups left without exceeding 1 member in each group.
   - These groups also bring back 2 seashells each.
   - The total number of seashells from these 4 groups is:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8
     \]

8. **Sum the seashells from both sets of groups:**
   - Adding the seashells from the two sets gives us:
     \[
     12 + 8 = 20
     \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the participants is **20**.<|im_end|>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Jamie's regular earnings for the given hours.

- **Regular hourly wage**: $20/hour
- **Number of regular hours worked**: 8 hours/day

\[ \text{Regular earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} \]
\[ \text{Regular earnings} = \$20 \times 8 \]

\[
= \$160
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra hours worked on Tuesday.

- **Total hours worked on Tuesday**: 11 hours
- **Regular hours**: 8 hours

\[ \text{Extra hours} = \text{Total hours} - \text{Regular hours} \]
\[ \text{Extra hours} = 11 - 8 \]

\[
= 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the overtime (extra) hourly rate.

- **Overtime hourly rate**: 150% of the regular hourly rate.
  
\[ \text{Overtime hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Regular hourly rate} \]
\[ \text{Overtime hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \$20 \]

\[
= \$30
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings from the overtime hours.

- **Overtime hours**: 3 hours
- **Overtime hourly rate**: \$30/hour

\[ \text{Earnings from overtime} = \text{Overtime hours} \times \text{Overtime hourly rate} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from overtime} = 3 \times \$30 \]

\[
= \$90
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total earnings for the day.

- **Regular earnings**: \$160
- **Earnings from overtime**: \$90

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Regular earnings} + \text{Earnings from overtime} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$160 + \$90 \]

\[
= \$250

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lions in the zoo enclosure. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The zookeeper has counted:
  - 12 female lions.
  - Half as many male lions as female lions.
  - 14 lion cubs.

### Step 2: Determine the number of male lions
Since the number of male lions is half the number of female lions:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{\text{Number of female lions}}{2} \]
Given that there are 12 female lions:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of lions excluding cubs
Now, let's add up the number of female and male lions:
\[ \text{Total number of lions (excluding cubs)} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total number of lions (excluding cubs)} = 12 (\text{female}) + 6 (\text{male}) = 18 \]

### Step 4: Add the number of lion cubs
We know there are 14 lion cubs, so we need to include them in our calculation:
\[ \text{Total number of lions in the enclosure} = \text{Total number of lions (excluding cubs)} + \text{Number of lion cubs} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total number of lions in the enclosure} = 18 + 14 = 32 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans.
2. Determine how much change Mike will receive from paying with a $50.00 bill.

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted price**

The original price of the jeans is $40. Since the jeans are advertised at 25% off, we first calculate 25% of $40.

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - (\text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount}}{100}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 40 - (40 \times \frac{25}{100}) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 40 - (40 \times 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 40 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = 30 \]

So, the jeans are now priced at $30 after the discount.

**Step 2: Determine the change Mike will receive**

Mike paid with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much change he gets back, we subtract the discounted price from the amount he paid:

\[ \text{Change} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Discounted Price} \]
\[ \text{Change} = 50 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Change} = 20 \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after making the purchase.

**Final Answer:**
\[

                    A company's , HR ? hires 20 new employees every month to add to its total workforce. ! If the company's ! initial employee : number is 200, and each : employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, calculate ? the : total amount ? of ! money the company pays ! to ; its employees : after ? three months?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Calculate the monthly payroll for one employee.
2. Determine the total number of employees hired over three months.
3. Multiply the monthly payroll by the total number of employees hired.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly payroll for one employee.
Each employee is paid $4000 per month.

Step 2: Determine the total number of employees hired over three months.
- The company hires 20 new employees every month.
- Over three months, the total number of employees hired is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).

Step 3: Multiply the monthly payroll by the total number of employees hired.
- The total amount of money paid to all employees after three months is \(4000 \times 60 = 240,000\).

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $\boxed{240000}$.<|im_end|>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

To determine the total time Carrie's choir will spend carolling, we need to consider the number of songs and their respective lengths.

1. **Identify the number of songs:**
   - ""Deck the Halls"": 2 times
   - ""Jingle Bells"": 1 time

2. **Calculate the total length for ""Deck the Halls"":**
   - Each song is 150 seconds long.
   - Total for ""Deck the Halls"" = \(2 \times 150\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the total length for ""Jingle Bells"":**
   - The song is 240 seconds long.
   - Total for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds.

4. **Sum the total lengths:**
   - Total time for ""Deck the Halls"" = \(2 \times 150\).
   - Total time for ""Jingle Bells"" = 240 seconds.
   - Combined total time = (Total for ""Deck the Halls"") + (Total for ""Jingle Bells"").

Let's perform these calculations:

\[ 
\text{Total time} = (2 \times 150) + 240

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Billy's initial salary after the raise
Billy's initial salary before any raises was $10/hour.

After receiving the $0.50 raise for every hour worked, his new hourly wage becomes:
\[ 10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since he has been working for 2 months (assuming an average of 30 days per month), we need to calculate the total number of hours he has worked:
\[ \text{Total hours worked} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate Billy's total earnings over these 60 hours:
\[ \text{Billy's total earnings} = 10.50 \times 60 = \$630 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Sally's starting salary
Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary. Since Billy's starting salary is $10/hour, Sally's starting salary is:
\[ 10 + 0.50 = \$10.50 \text{ per hour} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Sally's total earnings
If Sally works 20 hours, her total earnings will be:
\[ \text{Sally's total earnings} = 10.50 \times 20 = \$210 \]

### Step 4: Compare their earnings
Finally, to find out how much more money Billy earns compared to Sally, we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's earnings:
\[ \text{Difference in earnings} = 630 - 210 = \$420 \]

Therefore, Billy will earn $\boxed{420}$ dollars more than Sally.<|im_end|>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost for 3 loaves of bread:**
   - The cost of one loaf of bread is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for 3 loaves of bread is \( 3 \times \$2 = \$6 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost for 2 bagels:**
   - The cost of one bagel is $1.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 bagels is \( 2 \times \$1 = \$2 \).

3. **Determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost compared to 2 bagels:**
   - The difference in cost between 3 loaves of bread and 2 bagels is \( \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \).

Thus, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4}

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many points Nikita scored.
2. Calculate the total points scored by both players.

### Step 1: Determine Nikita's Score

Given that Nikita scored 11 points more than half as many points as Pierson, we can set up an equation to find out how many points Nikita scored.

Let \( P \) be the number of points Pierson scored, which is given as 278 points.

Nikita's score \( N \) is described as ""11 more than half as many points as Pierson.""

We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:
\[ N = \frac{P}{2} + 11 \]

Substitute \( P = 278 \):
\[ N = \frac{278}{2} + 11 \]
\[ N = 139 + 11 \]
\[ N = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Points

Now that we know both scores, we can add them together to get the total points.

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
\[ \text{Total points} = 278 + 150 \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 428 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{428}

2. Determine the number of trees each child plants.
3. Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
4. Sum up all the trees planted.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of children in the school**

- There are 40 classes in the school.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.

\[
\text{Total number of children} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of trees each child plants**

Each child plants one tree.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers**

- There are 3 teachers in each class.
- There are 40 classes in the school.

\[
\text{Number of teachers per class} = 3
\]
\[
\text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \times 3 = 120

- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

\[
\text{Trees per teacher} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Total number of trees planted by teachers} = 120 \times 2 = 240

**Step 4: Sum up all the trees planted**

- Children plant \( 1000 \) trees.
- Teachers plant \( 240 \) trees.

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they represent 30% of her total number of stuffed animals.

1. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals:**
   - Puppies: 3
   - Koalas: 5
   - Zebras: 2
   - Frogs: 4
   - Let's assume the number of stuffed goats to be \( x \).

   The total number of stuffed animals can be represented as:
   \[
   Total = (Puppies + Koalas + Zebras + Frogs) + (Goats)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   Total = (3 + 5 + 2 + 4) + x
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   Total = 14 + x
   \]

2. **Set up the equation for the desired percentage:**
   We want the number of stuffed goats (\(x\)) to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   x = 0.3 \times (Total)
   \]

3. **Substitute the expression for the total into the equation:**
   Substitute \( Total = 14 + x \):
   \[
   x = 0.3 \times (14 + x)
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Distribute the 0.3 on the right-hand side:
   \[
   x = 0.3 \times 14 + 0.3 \times x
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.3x
   \]
   Subtract 0.3x from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x - 0.3x = 4.2
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   0.7x = 4.2
   \]
   Divide both sides by 0.7:
   \[
   x = \frac{4.2}{0.7}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to make them 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 6 stuffed goats.<|im_end|>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.

To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to earn the achievement, we will break down her current play schedule into smaller segments and then sum up these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of days in two weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Two weeks consist of \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) days.

2. **Determine the total time spent on two weeks:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 14 days.
   - The total time played over two weeks is \( 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ hours} \).

3. **Calculate the remaining hours needed to reach 30 hours:**
   - Kris has already played for 28 hours.
   - To earn the achievement, she needs to have played for a total of 30 hours.
   - Therefore, the remaining hours required are \( 30 \text{ hours} - 28 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \).

Thus, Kris still needs to play for **2 hours** to earn the achievement.<|im_end|>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and apply our understanding of relative motion.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - Car A (let's call it ""Car A"") is traveling at 60 mph.
   - Car B (let's call it ""Car B"") is passing Car A at 70 mph.
   - Both cars travel for 2 hours.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each car in 2 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   
     For Car A:
       \( \text{Distance}_A = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)
   
     For Car B:
       \( \text{Distance}_B = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles} \)

3. **Determine the position of each car after 2 hours:**
   - Since Car A started from rest and Car B passed Car A at 70 mph, Car A has already moved forward 120 miles before Car B even starts its journey.
   - After 2 hours, Car A will have continued to move ahead, so we need to calculate its new position.

4. **Calculate the distance Car A travels further in 2 hours:**
   - Let’s denote the time difference between the two cars as \( t \) minutes.
   - In \( t \) minutes, Car A would travel:
     \( \text{Distance}_{\text{A}} = 60 \times \frac{t}{60} = t \, \text{miles} \)

5. **Combine distances:**
   - Total distance Car A travels after 2 hours:
     \( \text{Total Distance}_A = 120 + t \, \text{miles} \)

   - Total distance Car B travels after 2 hours:
     \( \text{Total Distance}_B = 140 \, \text{miles} \)

6. **Find the separation distance after 2 hours:**
   - We subtract the total distance Car A has traveled from the total distance Car B has traveled.
   - Therefore, the remaining distance between the two cars is:
     \( \text{Separation Distance} = | \text{Total Distance}_B - \text{Total Distance}_A | \)

8. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   - Substitute the values of \( t \):
     \( \text{Separation Distance} = | 140 - (120 + t) | \)

9. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Distribute the negative sign inside the absolute value:
     \( \text{Separation Distance} = | 140 - 120 - t | \)
   - Simplify further:
     \( \text{Separation Distance} = | 20 - t | \)

Since the value of \( t \) (time difference) does not affect the final calculation because it represents a constant that cancels out in the absolute value, we can conclude:

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{| 20 - t |} \]<|im_end|>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the ring including any premiums. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total cost before the premium**:
   - Diamond: $600
   - Gold: $300
   - Total cost = Diamond + Gold = $600 + $300 = $900

2. **Determine the premium amount**:
   - Premium rate: 30%
   - Premium amount = Total cost × Premium rate = $900 × 30%

3. **Calculate the premium amount**:
   \[
   \text{Premium Amount} = \$900 \times 0.30 = \$270
   \]

4. **Add the premium to the original total cost**:
   - Final cost = Original total cost + Premium amount = $900 + $270 = $1170

Therefore, James paid a total of $1170.

{The final answer is} $1170.<|im_end|>","The material cost 600+300=$<<600+300=900>>900

<|im_start|>user

To determine the overall pass rate for the school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:**
   - Third-grade: 340 students passed.
   - Fourth-grade: 40 students passed.

2. **Determine the pass rate for the fourth-grade students:**
   \[
   \text{Fourth-grade pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the pass rate for the fifth-grade students:**
   - Fifth-grade pass rate = twice the fourth-grade pass rate,
     \[
     \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
     \]
   - Number of fifth-grade students who passed:
     \[
     \text{Number of fifth-grade students who passed} = 400 \times 0.80 = 320
     \]

4. **Sum up all the students who passed across all grades:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of students who passed} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of students tested:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of students tested} = 340 + 40 + 100 + 320 = 800
   \]

6. **Compute the overall pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students tested}} = \frac{700}{800}
   \]

7. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{700}{800} = \frac{7}{8} = 0.875 \text{ or } 87.5\%
   \]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is \(87.5\%\).<|im_end|>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4

Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the number of glass chips needed for one square inch:**
   - The problem states that it takes 12 glass chips to cover 1 square inch.

2. **Determine the total area of the mosaic:**
   - Since the mosaic is 3 inches tall (assuming the height refers to the total length), we need to calculate the area.
   - Area = Height × Width
   - Given the width is 3 inches and assuming the mosaic is rectangular, we can consider it as an extension of its height in a similar fashion.
   - So, if the height is 3 inches, then the area would be approximately 9 square inches (since the width could be considered the same).

3. **Calculate the total number of glass chips needed:**
   - To find out how many chips are needed for 9 square inches at 12 chips per square inch,
     \[
     \text{Total chips} = 9 \times 12 = 108 \text{ chips}
     \]

4. **Determine how many chips fit in one bag:**
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.

5. **Calculate how many bags are required to get the necessary number of chips:**
   - Number of bags = Total chips needed / Chips per bag
   - Number of bags = \( \frac{108}{72} = 1.5 \) bags

6. **Since Milo cannot have half a bag, he needs to buy full bags.**

7. **Calculate the total length of the mosaic based on the given information:**
   - Given that 12 chips cover 1 square inch and the mosaic is 3 inches tall,
   - Therefore, the length of the mosaic will also be 3 inches.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.

Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many gallons of tea were at the party initially, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total quarts of tea consumed
First, we need to find out the total amount of tea that was drunk during the party.

- **Four students each drank:**  
  Each of these four students drank \(1.5\) quarts.
  \[
  4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
  \]

- **Sixteen students each drank:**  
  Each of these sixteen students drank \(2\) quarts.
  \[
  16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
  \]

Now, add the quarts consumed by both groups:
\[
6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Step 2: Determine initial quantity of tea
We know there are currently \(10\) quarts of tea left after the party. Therefore, before the party started, the initial amount of tea must have been:
\[
10 \text{ quarts (left)} + 38 \text{ quarts (consumed)}
\]
\[
= 48 \text{ quarts}
\]

### Step 3: Convert quarts to gallons
Finally, convert the initial number of quarts to gallons. Since there are \(4\) quarts in one gallon:
\[
\frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12 \text{ gallons}}
\]<|im_end|>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts

Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons
The party started with 12 gallons of tea.

To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of butterscotch candies sold so far.
Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies in stock and sold 150 more.

\[ \text{Total candies sold} = 100 + 150 = 250 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of butterscotch candies Dale wants to sell.
Since Dale has already sold 250 candies, this means he has not reached his goal yet.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining butterscotch candies needed to be sold.
Now, Dale wants to sell all 250 butterscotch candies he has left unsold.

\[ \text{Remaining candies to sell} = 250 - (100 + 150) = 250 - 250 = 0 \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell **no** butterscotch candies because he has already sold them all.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the growth pattern
- The number of students doubles every month.
- This means that if we start with \( N \) students at the beginning of the year, after 1 month, there will be \( 2N \) students, after 2 months, there will be \( 4N \) students, etc.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month up to May
- **End of January (after 1 month):**
  - Start with 10 students.
  - After 1 month: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) students.
  
- **End of February (after 2 months):**
  - Start with 20 students.
  - After 2 months: \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) students.
  
- **End of March (after 3 months):**
  - Start with 40 students.
  - After 3 months: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) students.
  
- **End of April (after 4 months):**
  - Start with 80 students.
  - After 4 months: \( 80 \times 2 = 160 \) students.
  
- **End of May (after 5 months):**
  - Start with 160 students.
  - After 5 months: \( 160 \times 2 = 320 \) students.

### Step 3: Determine the number of additional students added between the beginning and the end of May
- At the beginning of the year, there were 10 students.
- By the end of May, there are 320 students.
- Number of additional students = Final count - Initial count
\[ \text{Number of additional students} = 320 - 10 = 310 \]

### Conclusion
By the end of May, 310 additional students would have joined compared to the initial number of students on campus at the beginning of the year.

Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of branches Felix climbs per day given his total earnings over the course of one week.

### Step 1: Determine Total Earnings Per Branch
Felix charges $0.25 for every branch he climbs.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Number of Days in a Week
There are 7 days in a week.

### Step 3: Divide Total Earnings by Daily Charge
Total earnings = $105
Number of days in a week = 7

\[ \text{Average daily charge} = \frac{\$105}{7} = \$15 \]

### Step 4: Determine Average Number of Branches Climbed Per Day
We know that Felix charges $0.25 per branch. Therefore, if he averages $15 per day, then:

\[ \text{Average number of branches climbed per day} = \frac{\$15}{\$0.25} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{\$15}{\$0.25} = 60 \]

Therefore, Felix climbs an average of **60** branches per day.<|im_end|>","He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420

3. **Total Flowers Before Dropping**:
   - 3 + 4 = 7 initial flowers.
   - Add 5 more flowers: 7 + 5 = 12 total flowers before dropping any.

4. **Dropping Flowers**:
   - Drops 1 flower from each type: 1 from each of the 3 types (total 3 dropped).
   - Drops 1 more from the 4 types (total 1 additional drop).

5. **Remaining Flowers After Dropping**:
   - Initial 7 flowers minus 3 dropped: 7 - 3 = 4 flowers left after the first drop.
   - Additional 1 flower dropped: 4 - 1 = 3 flowers left after the second drop.

6. **Adding More Flowers**:
   - Adds 6 flowers with 7 petals each.

7. **Final Count of Flowers**:
   - 3 flowers initially picked plus 6 added = 9 flowers in total.

8. **Petals Calculation**:
   - From the initial group of 3 flowers:
     - 3 flowers * 5 petals = 15 petals.
   - From the next group of 4 flowers:
     - 4 flowers * 6 petals = 24 petals.
   - From the additional group of 5 flowers:
     - 5 flowers * 4 petals = 20 petals.
   - Adding the 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
     - 6 flowers * 7 petals = 42 petals.

9. **Summing Up All Petals**:
   - Total petals = 15 (initial) + 24 (next group) + 20 (additional) + 42 (added last)
   - Total petals = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of marshmallows needed for both kids' S'mores:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores.
   - Total marshmallows used = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

2. **Calculate the remaining marshmallows after accounting for the ones used:**
   - Initial number of marshmallows = 35.
   - Marshmallows used = 18.
   - Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows.

3. **Account for the 3 marshmallows that were dropped:**
   - Remaining marshmallows after dropping = 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows.

4. **Distribute the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:**
   - Number of marshmallows per person = 14 / 2 = 7 marshmallows per person.

                    , A new ! arcade opens up and Jack decides to play with his 3 ! friends. :  Jack can play a , game with 1 quarter . for 20 minutes.  ?

They play . for 4 ? hours.  How much money is used?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money was spent on arcade games, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time played
Jack and his three friends play together for 4 hours.

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Convert hours into minutes (since the game duration is given in minutes):

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of games played
Each person plays until they reach their maximum playing time. Let’s denote:
- \( J \) as Jack,
- \( F_1 \) as one friend who plays half as long as Jack,
- \( F_2 \) as another friend who plays twice as long as Jack.

Let’s find out how many games each person plays based on the information provided.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of games played by each person
- **Jack**:
  - Plays 1 game at 20 minutes per game.
  
- **Friend \( F_1 \)**:
  - Plays half as long as Jack, so \( 20 / 2 = 10 \) minutes per game.
  
- **Friend \( F_2 \)**:
  - Plays 1.5 times longer than Jack, so \( 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \) minutes per game.

### Step 4: Total number of games played
Add up all the games played:

\[ \text{Total games} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \text{ games} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost
Each game costs $0.25.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ games} \times \$0.25/\text{game} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$0.75 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:

\[
\boxed{\$0.75}
\]<|im_end|>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour
So he spends 3*.25=$<<3*.25=.75>>.75 an hour

So they spend 6*.25=$<<6*.25=1.5>>1.5 an hour
His last friend puts in money 3/1.5=<<3/1.5=2>>2 times an hour
So he spends 2*.25=$<<2*.25=.50>>.50 an hour
So in total they spend .75+1.5+.5=$<<.75+1.5+.5=2.75>>2.75 an hour

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much oil Tanya uses in her salt scrubs. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent the amount (in ounces) of salt used in one batch.
- Since Tanya uses twice as much salt as sugar, the amount of sugar used is \( \frac{S}{2} \).
- The amount of salt is also equal to the amount of fragrance. So, \( S = F \), where \( F \) represents the amount of fragrance used.
- Since the amount of salt is the same as the amount of zest, \( S = Z \).

### Step 2: Determine Oil Usage
- The amount of oil used is twice as much as the amount of salt. Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( 2S \).

Since the total volume of the jar is given as 10 ounces, let's calculate the total volume for one batch:

\[
\text{Total Volume} = \text{Volume of Salt} + \text{Volume of Oil}
\]

Given that the total volume is 10 ounces, and knowing that the total volume includes both salt and oil volumes, we can set up an equation:

\[
F + S = 10
\]

From our earlier relationships:

\[
F = S = Z = S
\]

Substituting back into the equation:

\[
S + S = 10
\]
\[
2S = 10
\]
\[
S = 5
\]

Now that we know \( S = 5 \):

- The volume of oil used is \( 2S \):
\[
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, Tanya uses **10 ounces** of oil per batch.<|im_end|>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately and then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times \$500 = \$1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times \$1500 = \$3000
   \]

3. **Sum the costs of the goats and the cows to get the total amount spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500
   \]

### Final Answer:

1. Determine the initial number of cars Joe has.
2. Calculate how many cars Joe sells.
3. Calculate how many cars Joe gives away to his mother.
4. Subtract the total number of cars sold and given away from the initial number.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Initial Number of Cars Joe Has:**
   - We know that Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate How Many Cars Joe Sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - So, he sells \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate How Many Cars Joe Gives Away to His Mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Subtract the Total Number of Cars Sold and Given Away from the Initial Number:**
   - Joe starts with 40 cars.
   - After selling 8 cars, he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - After giving away 16 cars, he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars remaining.

### Final Answer:
Joe remains with \(\boxed{16}\) cars after selling and giving some to his mother.<|im_end|>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.
He then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.
After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.
Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.
The number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16

3. **Subtract the amount raised by organizations:**
   Organizations raised $50,000.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Sandy spent walking over the two days and then convert that time into minutes.

**Step 1: Determine the number of hours Sandy walked on each day.**

- **First Day:** Sandy walked for 8 hours.
  
- **Second Day:** On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as the first day. Therefore, the number of hours walked on the second day is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

**Step 2: Add up the total number of hours walked over both days.**

Total hours = First Day + Second Day
Total hours = 8 hours (first day) + 4 hours (second day)
Total hours = 12 hours

**Step 3: Convert the total hours into minutes.**

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the total hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

Total minutes = Total hours × 60
Total minutes = 12 hours × 60 minutes/hour
Total minutes = 720 minutes

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is **720 minutes**.<|im_end|>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.

<|im_start|>system
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Initial Counting:**
   - Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

2. **First Break:**
   - During the first break, Hunter counted an additional 20 cars.
   
3. **Total After First Break:**
   - To find the total number of cars after the first break, we add these two quantities together:
     \[
     50 + 20 = 70
     \]
   So, at the end of the first break, there were 70 cars in the parking lot.

4. **Lunch Break Realization:**
   - At lunch time, Hunter realizes that half of the cars originally present (before the second count) have gone.
   
5. **Counting During Lunch Break:**
   - Since 1/2 of the original number has gone, the other half must remain. We need to determine how many cars remained after the initial counting.
   
6. **Calculating Remaining Cars:**
   - The remaining half of the original 70 cars would be:
     \[
     \frac{70}{2} = 35
     \]
   So, 35 cars remained after the initial count but before the second count.

7. **Final Count During Lunch Break:**
   - Hunter counts another 20 cars during the lunch break.
   
8. **Total Count During Lunch Break:**
   - Adding the 20 cars counted during the lunch break to the remaining 35 cars:
     \[
     35 + 20 = 55
     \]

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 55.

\[ \text{Sasha's score} = \text{Julie's score} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Points for Each Player
- **Sasha**'s total points:
\[ \text{Total points for Sasha} = \text{Points from first game} + \text{Points from second game} \]
\[ \text{Total points for Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

- **Julie**'s total points:
\[ \text{Total points for Julie} = \text{Points from first game} \]
\[ \text{Total points for Julie} = 10 \]

### Final Answer:
\[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more cans of cat food Kimberly purchased compared to dog food.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cans of cat food.
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package contains 11 cans.
So, the total number of cans of cat food is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cans of cat food} = 8 \times 11 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication for the number of cans of cat food.

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 88 cans of cat food.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cans of dog food.
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 cans.
So, the total number of cans of dog food is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cans of dog food} = 6 \times 6 \]

Step 4: Perform the multiplication for the number of cans of dog food.

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 36 cans of dog food.

Step 5: Determine how many more cans of cat food Kimberly bought compared to dog food.

\[ \text{Difference in cans} = \text{Total cans of cat food} - \text{Total cans of dog food} \]

Substitute the values obtained from steps 3 and 4 into the equation:

\[ \text{Difference in cans} = 88 - 36 \]

Step 6: Perform the subtraction.

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more cans of cat food than dog food.

Final Answer: The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ""Magic Card"" sets (or packs) Becca has based on the given information. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( B \) represent the number of Magic Card sets Becca has.
- \( S \) represents the number of Magic Card sets Smendrick has.
- \( P \) represents the number of Magic Card sets PJ has.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know from the problem statement that:
1. The total number of Magic Card sets is 341.
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more Magic Card sets than Smendrick.
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times as many Magic Card sets as PJ.
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve for Each Variable
First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Next, substitute \( B = 3P + 12 \) and \( S = 3P \) into the equation \( B + S + P = 341 \):
\[
(3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 329
\]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[
P = 47
\]

Now that we know \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]
\[
B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153
\]

### Final Answer
Becca has **153** Magic Card sets.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of cards PJ has

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Green Eggs**:
   - Cindy has 5 green eggs.
   
2. **Blue Eggs**:
   - Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue eggs} = 2 \times (\text{number of green eggs}) = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Pink Eggs**:
   - Cindy has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs.
     \[
     \text{Number of pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
     \]
     
4. **Yellow Eggs**:
   - Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times (\text{number of pink eggs}) = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
     \]

Now, let's sum up all the eggs:

- Green: 5
- Blue: 10
- Pink: 9
- Yellow: 3

Adding these together gives us the total number of eggs:
\[
5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
\]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs, altogether. 

Ending Answer:
The final answer is: 27 eggs.<|im_end|>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.

And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.
Added all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then determine how much Milly will lose from her purchase.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - Shipping cost per pound = $0.35
   - Weight of the book = 4 pounds
   - Total shipping cost (before discount) = \( 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35 \text{ per pound} \)

\[
= \$1.40
\]

2. **Add the distance cost:**
   - Distance between the store and the distribution center = 20 miles
   - Cost per mile = $0.08
   - Total distance cost = \( 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08 \text{ per mile} \)

\[
= \$1.60
\]

3. **Total shipping cost before discount:**
   - Total shipping cost = \( \$1.40 + \$1.60 \)

\[
= \$3.00
\]

4. **Determine the refund amount:**
   - Purchase price of the book = $32
   - Refund rate = 75%
   - Amount refunded = \( \$32 \times 0.75 \)

\[
= \$24
\]

5. **Calculate the net loss for Milly:**
   - Net loss = Total shipping cost after discount - Refunded amount

\[
= \$3.00 - \$24
\]

\[
= -$21
\]

### Final Answer:
Milly will lose $\boxed{-21}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60
Milly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial amount**: Mulan starts with $40.

2. **Father's gift**: Her father gives her an additional $100.
   - New total: $40 + $100 = $140.

3. **Spending on items**:
   - Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.
     - Cost of two pairs of jeans: 2 × $30 = $60.
   - She also buys a bag for $20.
     - Total cost of items: $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = $80.

4. **Calculating remaining money**:
   - Initial total after receiving money from father: $140.
   - Subtracting the cost of items bought: $140 - $80 = $60.

5. **Final amount left**: Mulan has $60 left.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break down the production data for each week and then sum up the total production over all four weeks.

1. **First Week:**
   - Total production in the first week = 8,000 bars of chocolates.
   
2. **Second Week:**
   - According to the problem statement, the second week produces half of what was produced in the first week.
   - So, the production in the second week = \(\frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000\) bars of chocolates.

3. **Third Week:**
   - The third week produces three times the amount that was produced in the first week.
   - Therefore, the production in the third week = \(3 \times 8,000 = 24,000\) bars of chocolates.

4. **Fourth Week:**
   - We need to find out how many bars of chocolates Boris produces in the fourth week.
   - Let's denote the number of bars produced in the fourth week as \(x\).

Now, let's calculate the total production over all four weeks:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: 4,000 bars
- Third week: 24,000 bars
- Fourth week: \(x\) bars

The total production over all four weeks can be represented as:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 + x \]

Since Boris has been producing 50,000 bars of chocolates per month (which means he produces chocolates every 6 days), and there are 7 days in a week, it implies that he produces chocolates on average once every 6 days.

Given his monthly production rate, we can infer that he produces chocolates at an approximate rate of approximately 9,259.25 chocolates per day. However, since he doesn't produce chocolates during weekends, we consider the production pattern from Monday to Friday.

Let's assume he produces chocolates daily (for simplicity) and calculates based on the given information:

We know:
- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week’s production = 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the second week’s production = 24,000 bars

Total production in one month:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars/month} \]

Therefore, the fourth week’s production should match the remaining part of the month after accounting for the previous weeks’ production.

Let's check if this matches the given information about the fourth week:
If the total production over the four weeks equals 50,000 bars, then:
\[ 36,000 + x = 50,000 \]
Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \]

Thus, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolates in the fourth week.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{14,000}\).<|im_end|>","In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the first three weeks, Boris produces 8,000+4,000+24,000 = <<8000+4000+24000=36000>>36,000 bars of chocolate

How much will : this cost , her?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the base cost without any additional items**

- The base cost for installation is $129.
  
**Step 2: Determine how many additional items Angela can afford**

Angela wants to add 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.

- Cost of one mirror = $129 / 4 (since there are 4 mirrors)
- Cost of one chandelier = $129 / 1 (since there is 1 chandelier)
- Cost of one picture = $129 / 10 (since there are 10 pictures)

Let's calculate these costs:

- Mirror cost: \( \frac{129}{4} = 32.25 \) dollars
- Chandelier cost: \( \frac{129}{1} = 129 \) dollars
- Picture cost: \( \frac{129}{10} = 12.9 \) dollars

Now, let's find out how many additional items Angela can buy with her budget:

- Total budget available = 6 mirrors + 2 chandeliers + 20 pictures
- Budget per item = $15

Number of items Angela can afford = \( \frac{\text{Total budget}}{\text{Budget per item}} \)

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Number of items} = \frac{6 \times 32.25 + 2 \times 129 + 20 \times 12.9}{15} \]

First, we need to calculate the total cost for all the items Angela wants to add:

- Cost of 6 mirrors: \( 6 \times 32.25 = 193.5 \) dollars
- Cost of 2 chandeliers: \( 2 \times 129 = 258 \) dollars
- Cost of 20 pictures: \( 20 \times 12.9 = 258 \) dollars

Summing up these amounts gives us the total cost before considering the additional items:

\[ \text{Total cost before additional items} = 193.5 + 258 + 258 = 709.5 \] dollars

Since Angela only has $129 initially, she cannot afford any additional items at all based on her budget.

Therefore, Angela cannot afford to add any additional items because she does not have enough money to cover the full cost of just the initial items listed in the question.

**Final Answer:** This option is not correct. Based on the given information and calculations, Angela cannot afford to add any additional items as she doesn't have enough money. Therefore, the cost for installing the initial items would be solely dependent on the base installation cost which is already included in the question. If you meant to ask about adding more items beyond what was mentioned, then the cost would depend on the number of items added beyond the initial ones. But based on the provided options and information, the correct answer should be stated as ""not enough information"" or ""cannot afford"". However, if forced to choose from the given choices, the closest reasonable response would be that the total cost for all items is $129 since that is the base installation cost. 

Given the constraints of the original question and the fact that additional items cannot be added within the budget, the correct approach would be to focus on the base cost rather than trying to add more items.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Anthony has saved.
- We know that Anthony saves $10 more than Eva.
- Eva has saved $20.

So, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + \$10 \]
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \$20 + \$10 \]
\[ \text{Anthony's savings} = \$30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Roy has saved compared to Anthony.
- We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
- Anthony has saved $30.

We need to find out what 40% of Anthony's savings is and then add it to Anthony's total savings.

First, convert 40% to a decimal for calculation purposes:
\[ 40\% = 0.40 \]

Now, calculate 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[ \text{Additional amount} = 0.40 \times \$30 \]
\[ \text{Additional amount} = \$12 \]

Finally, add this additional amount to Anthony's total savings:
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + \text{Additional amount} \]
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \$30 + \$12 \]
\[ \text{Roy's savings} = \$42 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.<|im_end|>","Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva who has $20.00 so he has 10+20 = $<<10+20=30.00>>30.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the relationship between Naruto and Kagiyami:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain that is ten times as high as what Kagiyami can.
   - This means if Kagiyami can lift a mountain ""h"" inches tall, then Naruto can lift a mountain ""10h"" inches tall.

2. **Determine the relationship between Kagiyami and Saskay:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain that is four times as high as what Saskay can.
   - This means if Saskay can lift a mountain ""s"" inches tall, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain ""4s"" inches tall.

3. **Determine the relationship between Saskay and Pompei:**
   - Saskay can lift a mountain that is twelve times as high as what Pompei can.
   - This means if Pompei can lift a mountain ""p"" inches tall, then Saskay can lift a mountain ""12p"" inches tall.

Given these relationships, we need to find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain based on the information provided about Pompei.

4. **Calculate the height Naruto can lift:**
   - Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch tall, Saskay can lift a mountain \( p = \frac{1}{12} \) inches tall (because they are related by the factor 12).
   - Now, using the relationship between Saskay and Kagiyami, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain that is 12 times higher than what Pompei can lift. So, Saskay can lift a mountain \( 12 \times \frac{1}{12} = 1 \) inch tall.
   - Finally, since Naruto can lift a mountain that is 10 times higher than what Kagiyami can lift, and knowing that Kagiyami can lift a mountain that is 4 times higher than what Pompei can lift, we get:
     \[
     \text{Naruto can lift a mountain} = 10 \times \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{12} \right)
     \]
     Simplifying this expression gives us:
     \[
     \text{Naruto can lift a mountain} = \frac{10}{48} = \frac{5}{24}
     \]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain that is \( \frac{5}{24} \) inches tall, which is equivalent to approximately \( 0.2083 \) inches or \( 0.2083 \) inches.

So, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the distance covered at different intervals.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:**
   - Speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:**
   - Let's denote the remaining time after resting as \( t \) hours.
   - The speed remains the same (8 miles per hour).
   - Time = \( t \) hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 8 \times t
   \]
   
   Since we don't have information about how long he rested, let's assume he rests for an unspecified period \( t \).

3. **Total distance calculation:**
   - Total distance = Distance_1 + Distance_2
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 32 + 8t
   \]

Since the exact duration of the rest period is not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value without additional information.

However, if we were given that the total travel time was 10 hours, we could proceed as follows:

- If the total travel time was 10 hours, then the rest period would be \( 10 - 4 - 6 = 0 \) hours, meaning there was no rest.
  
If there was indeed a rest period, but its duration isn't specified, we can only express the total distance in terms of \( t \), where \( t \) represents the rest period in hours.

So, if we had the complete details, such as knowing the total travel time or the rest period exactly, we could compute the exact number of miles. But based on the given information, the equation for the total distance is:

\[
\boxed{32 + 8t}
\]<|im_end|>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.

For the whole journey, Mason traveled for 32+48 = <<32+48=80>>80 miles.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Speed of the Kangaroos
- Given that three kangaroos can cover 18 miles in 1 hour.
- This means the combined speed of the three kangaroos is 6 miles per hour (since \( \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ mph} \)).

### Step 2: Calculate the Speed of One Kangaroo
Since all kangaroos travel at the same speed,
\[ \text{Speed of one kangaroo} = \frac{\text{Combined speed of three kangaroos}}{3} = \frac{6 \text{ mph}}{3} = 2 \text{ mph} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time for Four Turtles
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.
- Therefore, each turtle’s speed is \( \frac{2 \text{ mph}}{2} = 1 \text{ mph} \).

- The distance to be covered by the turtles remains the same as before (18 miles).
- Since each turtle travels at 1 mph, we need to find out how long it would take for each turtle to cover 18 miles.

\[ \text{Time taken by one turtle} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{18 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mph}} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, it will take **four turtles** **18 hours** to travel across the highway.

The final answer is: **18 hours**.<|im_end|>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Erika currently has in her purse after considering all the additional funds she will receive from different sources.

Let's break down the information:

1. **Cost of the Laptop**: $600
2. **Reduction in Price due to Trade-in**: $200
3. **Additional Amount Needed**: $50
4. **Amount Already Saved**: Let's denote this amount as \( S \)
5. **Amount Paid by Part-Time Job**: $150
6. **Amount Given by Mom**: $80
7. **Total Money Needed**: $600 - ($200 + $50) = $350

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Erika needs to buy the laptop:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$600 \]

Next, we know she has received additional amounts from various sources:
- From her part-time job: $150
- From her mom: $80

So, the total amount of money she already has or expects to have is:
\[ S + 150 + 80 = S + 230 \]

Since she still needs $50 more to reach the total cost of $350, the equation becomes:
\[ (S + 230) + 50 = 350 \]
\[ S + 280 = 350 \]
\[ S = 350 - 280 \]
\[ S = 70 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika currently has in her purse is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]<|im_end|>","Selling the old laptop reduced the cost of the new laptop to $600 – $200 = $<<600-200=400>>400 dollars.

Some of this money came from her mom, so the money she had herself was $350 – $80 = $<<350-80=270>>270.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of slices needed:**
   - Adam cuts 3 large apples.
     - Each large apple is cut into 5 pieces.
     - Therefore, for 3 large apples: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) slices.

2. **Calculate the number of slices from the small apples:**
   - Adam also cuts 5 small apples.
     - Each small apple is cut into 3 pieces.
     - Therefore, for 5 small apples: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

3. **Total number of slices available:**
   - Adding both types of slices together:
     - Large apples: 15 slices
     - Small apples: 15 slices
     - Total: \(15 + 15 = 30\) slices.

4. **Subtract the number of slices eaten:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much glue remains in each stick after it's been used and then calculate the total remaining length of all the unused glue.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the remaining length for each stick:**

   - **First stick (1/6 left):**
     \[
     \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 \text{ mm}
     \]
     Simplify the calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ mm}
     \]

   - **Second stick (2/3 left):**
     \[
     \text{Remaining length} = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \text{ mm}
     \]
     Simplify the calculation:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ mm}
     \]

   - **Third stick (1/2 left):**
     \[
     \text{Remaining length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ mm}
     \]
     Simplify the calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ mm}
     \]

2. **Sum up the remaining lengths from each stick:**
   \[
   \text{Total remaining length} = 2 \text{ mm} + 8 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm}
   \]
   Perform the addition:
   \[
   2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ mm}
   \]

                    question:
                    , Gabriel wants to buy a : car for $10000 , and a phone for : $800. Gabriel ? has $5000 from working on weekends . and ; his brother ; gave him $200 to help him. ? How much money does he ? still need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more money Gabriel needs, let's break down the costs and available funds:

1. **Calculate total cost of items:**
   - Cost of the car: $10000
   - Cost of the phone: $800
   
   Total cost = $10000 + $800 = $10800

2. **Determine total amount available:**
   - Money from working on weekends: $5000
   - Money from his brother: $200
   
   Total available funds = $5000 + $200 = $5200

3. **Subtract the total cost from the total available funds:**
   
   Remaining amount needed = $5200 - $10800 = -$5600

4. **Interpret the result:**
   Since the remaining amount is negative ($-5600), it means that Gabriel already has enough money to cover both the car and the phone.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 0

Gabriel does not need any additional money; he actually has an extra $5600.<|im_end|>","The amount of purchases Gabriel wants to make is $10000 + $800 = $<<10000+800=10800>>10800.

So, Gabriel still needs $10800 - $5200 = $<<10800-5200=5600>>5600.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many $20 bills were given.
2. Calculate the total amount spent.
3. Subtract the total amount spent from the original price of the hat to find the change.

Step 1: Determine how many $20 bills were given.
The number of $20 bills given can be calculated as follows:
Number of $20 bills = Total money given / Price per bill
Number of $20 bills = 4 / $20 = 0.2

Since it's not possible to give a fraction of a bill, we assume that the person only paid for one full $20 bill (as typically people pay whole amounts).

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Price of the hat + Amount paid in $20 bills
Total amount spent = $70 + ($20 * 0.2) = $70 + $4 = $74

Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent from the original price of the hat to find the change.
Change received = Original price - Total amount spent
Change received = $70 - $74 = -$4

Therefore, the correct interpretation should consider the payment made instead of what was due. Since the person only paid $80 (4 $20 bills), they didn't receive any change; instead, they owed $80.

Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The change received is $0. This means the person did not receive any change but owed an additional $80.<|im_end|>","If she gave the craftsman four $20 bills, the total amount of money she gave to the craftsman is 4*$20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Craig initially has:**
   - Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills.
   - Each bill is worth $20.
   \[
   \text{Total initial money} = 2 \times 20 = \$40
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the squirt guns:**
   - Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of squirt guns} = 6 \times 2 = \$12

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many socks and dishes Peter and Jack have collectively based on their relationships.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Jack collects:**
   - According to the information given, Jack collects twice as many dishes as socks.
   - We know that Jack collects 60 dishes.

2. **Calculate the number of socks Jack has:**
   - Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, if he has 60 dishes, then he also has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.

3. **Determine the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Therefore, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes both collect:**
   - Together, they have \( 60 + 60 = 120 \) dishes.

5. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes combined:**
   - Adding the total number of socks and dishes together gives us \( 60 \text{ (socks)} + 120 \text{ (dishes)} = 180 \).

   There are \( n \) students in total.
   
   Given that there are 20 students (\( n = 20 \)).

2. **Identify Students Good Only At Math:**
   There are 5 students who are good at math but not at English.

3. **Identify Students Good Only At English:**
   There are 8 students who are good at English but not at math.

4. **Calculate Number Of Students Who Are Good At Both Subjects:**
   Since all students must be either good at math or English, or both:
   
   The number of students who are good at both subjects can be found by subtracting those who are good only at one subject from the total number of students.
   
   Therefore,
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for one group and then divide that by the duration of one performance.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Time Available for One Group
- **Time allowed per group**: 2 hours (120 minutes)
  
  \[
  \text{Total time per group} = 2 \times 60 + 2 = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 2: Break Down Each Part of the Time Allocation
- **Time spent getting on stage**: 2 minutes
- **Time spent performing**: 6 minutes
- **Time spent exiting stage**: 2 minutes

### Step 3: Determine How Many Performances Fit Within This Time Frame
First, let's calculate the remaining time after accounting for the intermission.

- **Intermission time**: 10 minutes

\[
\text{Remaining time after intermission} = 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, subtract the time spent getting on stage from the total time per group.

\[
\text{Remaining time after getting on stage} = 110 - 2 = 108 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, subtract the time spent performing.

\[
\text{Remaining time after performance} = 108 - 6 = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, subtract the time spent exiting stage.

\[
\text{Remaining time after exiting stage} = 102 - 2 = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Number of Performances Performed
Divide the remaining time by the duration of one performance.

\[
\text{Number of performances per group} = \frac{100}{6}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{100}{6} \approx 16.67
\]

Since Vicki cannot have a fraction of a performance, we round down to the nearest whole number.

### Final Answer
Vicki can allow 16 groups to perform in the concert. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 16.<|im_end|>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Of those 120 minutes, 10 will be used for intermission, so 120 – 10 = <<120-10=110>>110 minutes for performances.
Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years using simple interest.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the principal (P), interest rate (r), time (t), and compound interest formula:**
   - Principal (P) = $300
   - Interest Rate (r) = Three-quarters of the original amount, so \( r = \frac{3}{4} \times P \)
   - Time (t) = 3 years

2. **Calculate the interest rate:**
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
   \]

3. **Use the simple interest formula to find the total amount (A):**
   \[
   A = P + Prt
   \]
   where \( t \) is the time period.

4. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   A = 300 + 225 \times 3 \times 3
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses first:**
   \[
   A = 300 + 225 \times 9
   \]

6. **Multiply 225 by 9:**
   \[
   A = 300 + 2025
   \]

7. **Add the results together:**
   \[
   A = 300 + 2025 = 2325
   \]

### Conclusion:
After performing all calculations, Brenda will have a total of $2325 after 3 years.

   - There are 40 white shirts in total.
   - Half of the white shirts have collars.
   - Therefore, half of 40 shirts = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) shirts with collars.

   To find the number of white shirts without collars, subtract the number of shirts with collars from the total number of white shirts:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ white shirts without collars}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with buttons:**
   - There are 50 floral shirts in total.
   - 20 of these have buttons.

3. **Determine the number of floral shirts without buttons:**
   - Subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts:

4. **Compare the numbers:**
   - Number of floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Number of white shirts without collars: 20

5. **Calculate how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:**

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many trays are needed:**
   - The farmer has 900 eggs.
   - Each tray can hold 30 eggs.
   
   To find out how many trays are required, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of one tray:
   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Capacity of one tray}} = \frac{900}{30} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling all trays:**
   - The farmer sells each tray for $2.5.
   - There are 30 trays.

   To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5 = 75

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many goats were initially on each farm.
- **Farm X**: Mr. Smith has 55 goats.
- **Farm Y**: We don't know how many goats are on Farm Y yet.

### Step 2: Calculate how many goats were sold from each farm.
- **From Farm X**:
  - Sold 10 goats.
  
- **From Farm Y**:
  - Sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, so he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of goats remaining on each farm after selling some.
- **Remaining goats on Farm X**:
  - Initial goats: 55
  - Sold goats: 10
  - Remaining goats: \(55 - 10 = 45\)

- **Remaining goats on Farm Y**:
  - Initial goats: Unknown (let's denote it as \(Y\))
  - Sold goats: 20
  - Remaining goats: \(Y - 20\)

### Step 4: Add the remaining goats from both farms together.
- Let's denote the total number of goats left as \(T\).
- Therefore,
\[ T = 45 + (Y - 20) \]

Since we do not have enough information to determine the initial number of goats on Farm Y (\(Y\)), we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for \(T\).

However, if we assume that the question aims to find the difference between the remaining goats on the two farms, then we can express the total remaining goats as:
\[ T = 45 + (Y - 20) \]

This expression represents the total number of goats left on the two farms combined.

                    question:
                    ! James buys 2 pairs of ! shoes a month.  He ? spends ? $2640 on shoes ; each year.  How much does he pay , on . average for each pair of . shoes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes per year.

1. **Determine the total number of months in one year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes bought in one year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month.
   - Over 12 months, he will buy \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) pairs of shoes.

3. **Find the total amount spent on shoes over the course of one year:**
   - James spends $2640 on shoes during one year.

4. **Calculate the cost per pair of shoes:**
   - To find out how much James pays for each pair of shoes, divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs purchased.
   - The cost per pair of shoes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Number of pairs purchased}} = \frac{2640}{24}
     \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   - Divide 2640 by 24:
     \[
     \frac{2640}{24} = 110
     \]

Therefore, James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes per year.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 110.<|im_end|>","He buys 2*12=<<2*12=24>>24 pairs of shoes a year

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost without any discount.
First, we need to calculate the total cost before applying any discounts.

- The price of one basket of green food = $25
- The price of one basket of red food = $18

If you buy 3 baskets of green food:
\[ 3 \times 25 = \$75 \]

If you buy 3 baskets of red food:
\[ 3 \times 18 = \$54 \]

Total cost before any discount:
\[ \$75 + \$54 = \$129 \]

### Step 2: Apply the discount.
You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

Since you're buying 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = \$6 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \$129 - \$6 = \$123 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay after applying all discounts is:
\[
\boxed{123}
\]<|im_end|>","The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.
The 3 baskets of red food will cost $18 x 3 = $<<18*3=54>>54.
There will be $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6 off for the baskets of red food.
So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of rooms that need cleaning:**
   - We know there are 90 rooms in total.
   - We need to find out how many rooms will be cleaned if only half of them are cleaned.

2. **Calculate half of the total number of rooms:**
   \[
   \text{Half of 90} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to clean one room:**
   - Housekeeping takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

4. **Calculate the total time for cleaning one-half of the rooms:**
   - Multiply the number of rooms (half of the total) by the time taken per room.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 45 \times 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   
5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, divide the total minutes by 60.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{45 \times 20}{60}
   \]

Now, let's perform the calculations:

\[
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}

- **First Year**: They will build 12 homes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of homes built in the second year.
- According to the instructions, they will build ""three times as many homes"" as in the first year.
\[ \text{Second Year Homes} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of homes built in the third year.
- The third year involves doubling the total number of homes from the second year.
\[ \text{Third Year Homes} = 2 \times (12 + 36) = 2 \times 48 = 96 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of homes built over the three years.
- Add the number of homes built in each year.
\[ \text{Total Homes Built} = 12 (\text{First Year}) + 36 (\text{Second Year}) + 96 (\text{Third Year}) \]
\[ \text{Total Homes Built} = 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \]

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be your current age.
   - Your brother's age is \( x + 3 \).
   - Your sister's age is \( y \).

2. **Use the given information to set up equations:**
   - You are 2 years older than your sister: \( x = y + 2 \).
   - Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( m = 3(x + 3) - 1 \).

3. **Substitute into the total age equation:**
   - The sum of your ages, your brother's age, and your mom's age equals 87: 
     \[
     x + (x + 3) + m = 87
     \]
   
4. **Simplify the total age equation:**
   - Substitute \( x = y + 2 \) and \( m = 3(x + 3) - 1 \):
     \[
     x + (x + 3) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87
     \]

5. **Combine like terms:**
   - Simplify inside the brackets first:
     \[
     x + (x + 3) + [3x + 9 - 1] = 87
     \]
     \[
     x + x + 3 + 3x + 8 = 87
     \]
     \[
     5x + 11 = 87
     \]

6. **Isolate the variable:**
   - Subtract 11 from both sides:
     \[
     5x = 76
     \]
   - Divide by 5:
     \[
     x = 15.2
     \]

Therefore, you are currently 15.2 years old.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{15.2}\).<|im_end|>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.

To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:**
   - There are 27 students.
   - Each student requires 2 glue sticks.

\[
\text{Total glue sticks needed} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Glue sticks per student}
\]

\[
= 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
\]

2. **Determine the number of packs required:**
   - Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
   - We need to find out how many packs are needed to get at least 54 glue sticks.

\[
\text{Packs needed} = \lceil \frac{\text{Total glue sticks needed}}{\text{Glue sticks per pack}} \rceil
\]

\[
\text{Packs needed} = \left\lceil \frac{54}{8} \right\rceil
\]

3. **Perform the division and round up to the nearest whole number:**

\[
\frac{54}{8} = 6.75
\]

Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, you must round up to the next whole number:

\[
\left\lceil 6.75 \right\rceil = 7
\]

So, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - On the first day (before any rain), the river passes through 4000 gallons of water.

2. **Volume Increase Due to Heavy Rain:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the volume of water doubles.
   - Therefore, the new volume after the rain is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Additional Volume on Third Day:**
   - On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons of water pass through the river.

Now, let's sum up all the volumes over the three days:

                    question:
                    ! Claire earns 1 girl scout ? badge : every month.  It takes Amber twice as long ? to earn a badge than Claire. !  ? Wendy earns three times the amount ! of : badges . as .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how long it takes Amber to earn one badge.
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.
- Amber takes twice as long as Claire to earn a badge.

Since Claire takes 1 month to earn her badge, Amber will take:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ months} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many badges Claire earns in a 1-year period.
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Claire earns 1 badge per month.

Therefore, in 1 year (12 months):
\[ 12 \text{ months} \div 1 \text{ month/badge} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

### Step 3: Determine how long it takes Amber to earn these badges.
- Amber takes 2 months to earn one badge.

For 12 badges:
\[ 12 \text{ badges} \times 2 \text{ months/badge} = 24 \text{ months} \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many badges Wendy earns in a 1-year period.
- Wendy earns 3 times as many badges as Claire in the same timeframe.

Given that Claire earns 1 badge per month:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ badges/month} \]

In 12 months (a year):
\[ 12 \text{ months} \times 3 \text{ badges/month} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

### Step 5: Find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
- Wendy earns 36 badges in 1 year.
- Amber takes 24 months to earn those badges.

Since Amber took 24 months for 36 badges, we can find out how many badges she would need to earn in half the time:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \div 2 = 12 \text{ months} \]

At a rate of 3 badges per month:
\[ 12 \text{ months} \times 3 \text{ badges/month} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Thus, Wendy needs 36 badges to match what Amber earned in 24 months.

### Conclusion:
Wendy earns \( 36 - 36 = 0 \) more badges than Amber over a 1-year period.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{0}}
\]<|im_end|>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges

Wendy earns 3 times the amount of badges compared to Claire who earns 12 badges so over 1 year Wendy earns 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 badges
Wendy earns 36 badges while Amber earns 6 so Wendy has earned 36-6 = <<36-6=30>>30 more badges

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of hours worked**:
   - Paige bakes every hour.
   - She works from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM.
   - Number of hours = 6 - 1 = 5 hours.

2. **Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked**:
   - For each hour, she bakes 2 loaves.
   - Total loaves = 5 hours * 2 loaves/hour = 10 loaves.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices**:
   - Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.
   - Total slices = 10 loaves * 8 slices/loaf = 80 slices.

4. **Calculate the total sales revenue**:
   - Each slice is sold for $0.50.
   - Total revenue = 80 slices * $0.50/slice = $40.

Therefore, the amount raised by selling all the slices is $40. The final answer is: The final answer is: $40.<|im_end|>","From 1pm - 6pm, there are 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coins Gretchen has in total. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     G = S + 30
     \]
   - We also know that if Gretchen had 70 gold coins, then her total number of coins would be:
     \[
     Total = G + S
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Value into the Equation for Gold Coins:**
   - According to the information given, \( G = 70 \).

4. **Solve for Silver Coins Using the Equation from Step 2:**
   - Substitute \( G = 70 \) into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
     \[
     70 = S + 30
     \]
   - Subtract 30 from both sides to find \( S \):
     \[
     40 = S
     \]
   - So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Coins:**
   - Now that we know \( S = 40 \), we can calculate the total number of coins using the equation \( Total = G + S \):
     \[
     Total = 70 + 40
     \]
   - Add these values together:
     \[
     Total = 110

Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. The final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos consumed.
2. Subtract the consumed burritos from the initial amount.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Burritos Consumed

- There are 50 students in the class.
- Each student gets 10 burritos.
- Mr. George eats 20 burritos.

First, let's find out how many burritos are consumed by the students:
\[ \text{Burritos per student} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of students} = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total burritos eaten by students} = 10 \times 50 = 500 \]

Next, add the burritos that Mr. George eats:
\[ \text{Total burritos eaten} = 500 + 20 = 520 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Burritos

Now, subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the initial number of burritos ordered:
\[ \text{Initial burritos} = 600 \]
\[ \text{Remaining burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is **80**.<|im_end|>","The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow cars in the rink. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cars
We know there are 12 red cars.
There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars.

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 \]

Substitute the number of red cars:

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of blue cars
There are 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars.

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} \]

Substitute the number of green cars:

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of cars (excluding yellow)
Now we add up all the known cars (red, green, and blue):

\[ \text{Total number of known cars} = 12 (\text{red}) + 10 (\text{green}) + 30 (\text{blue}) \]

\[ \text{Total number of known cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of yellow cars
We know that the total number of cars is 75. We subtract the total number of known cars from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Total number of known cars} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 = 23 \]

                    Together, ? Sofie, , Anne, and Fawn have : 85 books. : If Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, : and Anne has 12 fewer books than , Fawn does, , how many : books , does Fawn have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Fawn has based on the information given about the number of books each person has.

Step 1: Define variables for the number of books each person has.
Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
Then, Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books.
And Fawn has \( A + 37 \) books (since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn).

Step 2: Set up an equation representing the total number of books.
According to the problem, together they have 85 books. So, we can write the equation as:
\[ A + (A + 25) + (A + 37) = 85 \]

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 62 = 85 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( A \).
Subtract 62 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 23 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = \frac{23}{3} \approx 7.67 \]

Since \( A \) must be a whole number, it seems there might be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's recheck the logical steps:

- Anne has approximately 7.67 books.
- Sofie has approximately 32.67 books.
- Fawn has approximately 49.67 books.

Given that these values don't align with typical book counts, let's consider if rounding was intended or if there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Assuming the problem meant to imply whole numbers, let's try solving again without rounding:

- Anne: 7 books (rounding down)
- Sofie: 32 books (since she has 25 more than Anne)
- Fawn: 40 books (since she has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Now check the total:
\[ 7 + 32 + 40 = 81 \]

This doesn't match 85, so let's correct our approach:

Re-evaluate Anne's count:
Anne should be 12 less than Fawn’s count, not Sofie’s. Let Anne be 12 less than Fawn.

- Anne: 12 books (Fawn's count - 12)
- Sofie: 32 books (Sofie's count)
- Fawn: 44 books (Fawn's count)

Check the total:
\[ 12 + 32 + 44 = 88 \]

Still incorrect. Let's simplify directly:
If Anne = 12, then Sofie = 37, Fawn = 49.

Final check:
\[ 12 + 37 + 49 = 98 \]

Clearly wrong. Let's reconsider:

- Anne: 10 books (Fawn's count - 10)
- Sofie: 35 books (Sofie's count)
- Fawn: 40 books (Fawn's count)

Check the total:
\[ 10 + 35 + 40 = 85 \]

Correct solution:
- Anne: 10 books
- Sofie: 35 books
- Fawn: 40 books

So, Fawn has 40 books. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.

Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

   - We know that the total amount spent over four weeks is $400.
   - To find out how much Keenan spends per week, divide the total amount spent over four weeks by 4 (since there are four weeks).
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \frac{400}{4} = \$100
   \]

Therefore, Keenan spends $100 per week on groceries. 

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$100}

                    question:
                    Tobias bought a big . pizza : with 60 ; pieces. He ate 2/5 : of ; the pieces on the first . day, 10 pieces on the ! second day, and . 7/13 of the remaining pieces ! on the third , day. How many pizza pieces . has he eaten so ? far?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten on the first day.
- Total pieces in the pizza: \( 60 \)
- Fraction eaten on the first day: \( \frac{2}{5} \)

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = 60 \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = 60 \times 0.4 \]

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = 24 \]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining pieces after the first day.
\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 \]

\[ \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of remaining pieces eaten on the second day.
- Pieces eaten on the second day: \( 10 \) (given directly)

### Step 4: Calculate the fraction of remaining pieces eaten on the third day.
- Remaining pieces after the first day: \( 36 \)
- Fraction eaten on the third day: \( \frac{7}{13} \)

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = 36 \times \frac{7}{13} \]

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = 36 \times \frac{7}{13} \]

\[ \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = 28 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all the pieces eaten over the three days.

- Pieces eaten on the first day: \( 24 \)
- Pieces eaten on the second day: \( 10 \)
- Pieces eaten on the third day: \( 28 \)

\[ \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 + 10 + 28 \]

\[ \text{Total pieces eaten} = 62 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is **62**.<|im_end|>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.
On the second day, Tobias ate 10 more pieces of the pizza, totaling 24+10 = <<24+10=34>>34 pieces
The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the price per bottle for soda.
Given that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can calculate the price per bottle of soda as follows:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of soda} = \frac{\$21.00}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Price per bottle of soda} = \$3.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda.
Since one bottle of soda costs $3.00, three bottles will cost:

\[
3 \times \$3.00 = \$9.00
\]

### Step 3: Determine the price per bottle for water.
Given that four bottles of water cost $8.00, we can calculate the price per bottle of water as follows:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of water} = \frac{\$8.00}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Price per bottle of water} = \$2.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 2 bottles of water.
Since one bottle of water costs $2.00, two bottles will cost:

\[
2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00
\]

### Step 5: Add the costs together to find the total amount David needs to spend.

David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. Therefore, the total cost will be:

\[
\$9.00 (soda) + \$4.00 (water) = \$13.00
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total cost for David to purchase 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is **$13.00**.<|im_end|>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.
Three bottles of soda cost $3.00 x 3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00.
One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.
Therefore, 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water cost $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the bolts.
2. Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David currently has.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bolts.
- Each bolt costs $0.03.
- David wants to buy 16 bolts.

Total cost = Number of bolts × Cost per bolt
             = 16 × $0.03
             = $0.48

Step 2: Subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David currently has.
- David has $12.48 initially.

Remaining money = Initial amount - Total cost of bolts
                = $12.48 - $0.48
                = $12.00

Therefore, after buying the bolts, David will have $12.00 left.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $12.00.<|im_end|>","David paid 16 * 0.03 = $<<16*0.03=0.48>>0.48 for the bolts.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly wage Ella earns from dog walking and then use that information to calculate her earnings for 12 hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Ella's Hourly Wage:**
   - Ella earned $33 in 3 hours.
   - To find her hourly wage, divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked:
     \[
     \text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour}
     \]

2. **Determine Earnings for 12 Hours:**
   - Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate her earnings if she works for 12 hours.
   - Multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she will work:
     \[
     \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = \$132
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$132}
\]<|im_end|>","Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many marbles Paul received from his friend**

Paul initially had 52 marbles. He received an additional 28 marbles from his friend.

\[ \text{Total after receiving} = 52 + 28 \]

Let's calculate that first.
  
\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

So, Paul now has 80 marbles after receiving them from his friend.

**Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Paul lost**

Paul then lost one-fourth of his total marbles.

\[ \text{Marbles lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \]

Let's calculate that next.
  
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul lost 20 marbles.

**Step 3: Determine how many marbles Paul has left**

Subtract the number of marbles lost from the total number of marbles he had after receiving more.

\[ \text{Remaining marbles} = 80 - 20 \]

Let's calculate that lastly.
  
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, Paul has **60 marbles left**.<|im_end|>","Paul has a total of 52 + 28 = <<52+28=80>>80 marbles.
He lost 1/4 x 80 = <<80/4=20>>20 marbles.
Therefore, he has 80 - 20 = <<80-20=60>>60 marbles left.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points Amy earns from her test based on the given percentages for different types of questions. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Points from Multiple-Choice Questions
Amy correctly answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions.

Given:
- Number of multiple-choice questions = 10
- Percentage correct = 80%

Points per multiple-choice question = 1 point

Total points from multiple-choice questions:
\[
\text{Multiple-choice points} = \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) \times 10 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Points from True/False Questions
Amy correctly answers 90% of the true/false questions.

Given:
- Number of true/false questions = 20
- Percentage correct = 90%

Points per true/false question = 1 point

Total points from true/false questions:
\[
\text{True/false points} = \left(\frac{90}{100}\right) \times 20 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Points from Long Answer Questions
Amy correctly answers 60% of the long-answer questions.

Given:
- Number of long-answer questions = 5
- Percentage correct = 60%

Points per long-answer question = 5 points

Total points from long-answer questions:
\[
\text{Long-answer points} = \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) \times 5 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Sum Up All Points
Now, let’s sum up all the points from each type of question to get the total score:

\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Multiple-choice points} + \text{True/false points} + \text{Long-answer points}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41
\]

Therefore, Amy scores **41 points** in total.

### Final Answer
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 41}}<|im_end|>","First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of buying chickens that Isaias plans to sell at the market. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the number of chickens Isaias will sell:**
   - Isaias plans to sell \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his 300 chickens.
   - Number of chickens sold = \(300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180\) chickens.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $50.
   - Total revenue = \(180 \times 50 = \$9000\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the chickens taken to the market:**
   - The profit Isaias wants to make is $2000.
   - He needs to cover the cost of buying the chickens minus the profit.
   - Cost of buying the chickens = \(Cost\) (unknown).
   - Profit equation: \(Profit = Revenue - Cost\).
   - Substituting known values: \(2000 = 9000 - Cost\).
   - Solving for Cost: \(Cost = 9000 - 2000 = \$7000\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Isaias buys the chickens he takes to the market for $7000.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$7000} \]<|im_end|>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.

To determine how many more glasses Julie sold compared to Micah, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of glasses sold:**
   - The total number of glasses sold by all three boys together is given as 32.

2. **Calculate the number of glasses sold by both Micah and Mitchell combined:**
   - Since Julie sold 14 glasses, we subtract this from the total to find out how many glasses were sold by Micah and Mitchell.
     \[
     \text{Glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell} = 32 - 14 = 18
     \]

3. **Divide the remaining glasses equally between Micah and Mitchell:**
   - Both Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses.
     \[
     \text{Glasses sold by Micah} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
     \[
     \text{Glasses sold by Mitchell} = \frac{18}{2} = 9

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the manicure.
Iris spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much on her hair as on the manicure. Let's denote the cost of the manicure as \( M \).

Given that she spent $400 on her hair, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4}M = 400 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 400 \times 4 \]
\[ M = 1600 \]

So, the cost of the manicure is $1600.

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the pedicure.
According to the problem, Iris spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much on the pedicure as on the manicure. We already know the cost of the manicure ($1600), so we can calculate the cost of the pedicure as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1600 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = 3 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = 1200 \]

So, the cost of the pedicure is $1200.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent at the spa.
Now, we need to find out how much money Iris spent in total at the spa. This includes the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure. 

- Cost of hair: $400
- Cost of manicure: $1600
- Cost of pedicure: $1200

Adding these amounts together gives us:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 1600 + 1200 \]

Summing them up:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2200 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is **$2200**.<|im_end|>","The total amount of money that Iris used to do a manicure is 1/4*$400 = $<<1/4*400=100>>100

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the original rope
Sarah bought the original rope at $2 per meter.
- Length of the original rope = 20 meters
- Cost per meter = $2

Total cost of the original rope:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Length} \times \text{Cost per meter} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$40 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many meters of the new rope Sarah can buy
Sarah uses the profit from selling the old rope to buy more rope.
- Profit from selling the old rope = Total cost of the original rope - Selling price
- Selling price of the new rope = $1.5 per meter

First, calculate the total profit from selling the old rope:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Selling price} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$40 - \$8 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$32 \]

Now, determine how many meters of the new rope Sarah can buy with her profit:
\[ \text{Number of meters} = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost per meter of the new rope}} \]
\[ \text{Number of meters} = \frac{\$32}{\$1.5/\text{meter}} \]
\[ \text{Number of meters} = 21.33 \text{ meters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money Sarah has after buying the new rope
Since Sarah can only buy whole meters of the new rope, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Sarah will be able to buy approximately 21 meters of the new rope.

### Step 4: Calculate the leftover money
Subtract the cost of the new rope from her initial profit:
\[ \text{Leftover money} = \text{Profit} - (\text{Number of meters} \times \text{Cost per meter of the new rope}) \]
\[ \text{Leftover money} = \$32 - (21 \times \$1.5) \]
\[ \text{Leftover money} = \$32 - \$31.5 \]
\[ \text{Leftover money} = \$0.5 \]

### Final Answer
After buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$0.5** left over.<|im_end|>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40
She can buy the rope at the store for $30 because 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30
She has $10 left over because 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10

                    question:
                    In 10 years, Melanie ! will be ! 18 ? years : old. In how many years will her age be thrice , her : present age?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine two things: (1) in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her current age, and (2) after 10 years from now.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine Melanie's current age

Given that in 10 years Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up an equation based on her future age:

\[ \text{Melanie's current age} + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for her current age:

\[ \text{Melanie's current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

### Step 2: Find out when her age will be three times her current age

Now, we want to find out when her age will be three times what she is currently. Let's denote the number of years after 10 as \( x \).

In \( x \) years, her age will be:

\[ 10 + x \]

And according to the problem, this should be equal to three times her current age:

\[ 10 + x = 3 \times 8 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 10 + x = 24 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 10 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Therefore, Melanie's age will be three times her current age in **14 years**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 14}}
\]<|im_end|>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.
So, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Kelly will spend on groceries and subtract that from her total budget. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Bacon Packs
Kelly has 5 packs of bacon. Each pack costs $2 (since they cost $10 in total).

\[ \text{Cost of bacon} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Chicken Packs
Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.

\[ \text{Cost of one chicken pack} = 2 \times \$2 = \$4 \]
Since she has 6 packs of chicken,

\[ \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times \$4 = \$24 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of Strawberries Packs
She has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.

\[ \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times \$4 = \$12 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost of All Items
Now, let's add up all these costs to find out how much Kelly spends in total.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 (\text{bacon}) + \$24 (\text{chicken}) + \$12 (\text{strawberries}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$24 + \$12 = \$46 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the Total Cost from Her Budget
Finally, let's subtract the total cost from her budget to see how much money she has left.

\[ \text{Money left} = \$65 - \$46 = \$19 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, after shopping at the supermarket, Kelly will be left with **\$19** in her budget. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$19}
\]<|im_end|>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the length of Elaina's usual concert, let's break down the information provided:

1. The final concert is twice as long as her usual concert.
2. The final concert runs for 65 minutes.
3. In addition to the main performance, there is an encore that lasts 15 minutes.

First, we need to find out how much time the encore takes up. Since the encore is performed at the end of the concert and does not count towards the total runtime of the concert itself (it only adds extra time), we can subtract it from the total runtime of the final concert.

So, if the final concert runs for 65 minutes and includes a 15-minute encore, the time taken by the actual performance would be:
\[ \text{Time of the performance} = \text{Total runtime} - \text{Ensemble time} \]
\[ \text{Time of the performance} = 65 - 15 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, since this time represents half of the length of her usual concert, because the final concert is twice as long, we divide the time of the performance by 2 to get the length of her usual concert:
\[ \text{Length of usual concert} = \frac{\text{Time of the performance}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Length of usual concert} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Elaina’s usual concert runs for **25 minutes**.<|im_end|>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

   - To Bonnie: Argo gives 80 toys.
   - To Nicky: Argo gives 30 toys.

3. **Subtracting the toys given away from the initial amount**:
   - After giving toys to Alyssa: \( 200 - 40 = 160 \)
   - After giving toys to Bonnie: \( 160 - 80 = 80 \)
   - After giving toys to Nicky: \( 80 - 30 = 50 \)

So, after all the transactions, Argo has 50 toys left.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chimichangas are made on Wednesday and Friday based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday:**
   - We know that on Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
   - On Wednesday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 125 \).

\[
\text{Number of chimichangas on Wednesday} = 2 \times 125 = 250
\]

2. **Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday):**

   - Chimichangas on Tuesday: 125
   - Chimichangas on Wednesday: 250
   - Chimichangas on Friday: Twice as many as on Wednesday (since it's mentioned ""twice as many"").

First, calculate the number of chimichangas made on Friday:
  
\[
\text{Number of chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times 250 = 500
\]

3. **Sum up the total number of chimichangas made in these three days:**

\[
\text{Total number of chimichangas} = 125 + 250 + 500
\]

4. **Perform the addition:**

\[
125 + 250 = 375
\]
\[
375 + 500 = 875
\]

Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is **875**.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of microphones:**
   The singer has 50 microphones.

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that can fit into pairs:**
   Since 20% of the microphones won't find space, we first calculate 20% of 50.
   
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 microphones will not be arranged in pairs because they don’t have enough space.

3. **Calculate the number of microphones that can fit into pairs:**
   Subtract the 10 microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones.
   
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40
   \]
   Therefore, 40 microphones will be arranged in pairs.

4. **Divide these microphones equally into pairs:**
   To determine how many pairs can be formed from 40 microphones, divide 40 by 2 (since each pair consists of two microphones).
   
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   This calculation shows that 20 pairs of microphones can be arranged on the stage.

Therefore, the number of pairs of microphones that were arranged on the stage is **20**.<|im_end|>","The number of microphones that were not able to find space on the stage is 20/100*50 = <<20/100*50=10>>10

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Counting the birds in the bushes:**
   - Jerry counted 6 birds.
   - These birds are nesting.

2. **Calculating the number of birds flying overhead:**
   - We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the birds in the bushes are flying overhead.
   - So, we need to find \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 6.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \)
   - Therefore, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

3. **Adding the numbers together:**
   - The number of birds in the bushes is 6.
   - The number of birds flying overhead is 4.
   - Total birds = 6 + 4 = 10

4. **Accounting for the feeding groups:**
   - There are 3 groups of 8 birds each.
   - Calculate the total number of birds in these groups: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \)

5. **Summing up all the birds:**
   - Birds in the bushes: 6
   - Birds flying overhead: 4
   - Birds feeding (from the groups): 24
   - Total birds = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 34.<|im_end|>","First find how many birds are flying overhead: 6 birds * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 birds

   - Let's denote the number of outdoor plants as \( O \).
   - Given that \( O \) is two-thirds of the remaining plants, we can write: 
     \( O = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 \)
   - Calculation: \( O = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \) outdoor plants.

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants**:
   - The remaining plants are flowering plants.
   - Since there are 75 remaining plants and all of them are either outdoor or flowering, the number of flowering plants must be equal to the number of remaining plants minus the number of outdoor plants.
   - Calculation: Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants = 75 - 50 = 25.

6. **Percentage calculation**:
   - To find the percentage of flowering plants, we use the formula: 
     \( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \)
   - Calculation: \( \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \)

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 25%.<|im_end|>","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.
So, 100 - 25 = <<100-25=75>>75 plants are not indoor plants.
There are 75 x 2/3 = <<75*2/3=50>>50 outdoor plants.
And 75 - 50 = <<75-50=25>>25 flowering plants.
Thus, 25/100 x 100% = 25% of the plants are flowering plants.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how fast a whirligig spins based on the given information about the speeds of different objects.

Step 1: Determine the speed of a thingamabob.
- The whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob.
- The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

Since the whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob by dividing the speed of the whatchamacallit by 11.

Speed of the thingamabob = (Speed of the whatchamacallit) / 11
= (121 meters/second) / 11
= 11 meters/second

Step 2: Determine the speed of the whirligig.
- The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob.

Now that we know the speed of the thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of the whirligig:

Speed of the whirligig = Speed of the thingamabob * 5
= 11 meters/second * 5
= 55 meters/second

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 55 meters/second.<|im_end|>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the yogurt per day.
- We know that the yogurt costs half the price of the salad.
- The salad costs $6.

So, the yogurt costs:
\[ \text{Yogurt Cost} = \frac{\$6}{2} = \$3 \]

### Step 2: Determine the daily cost of all items excluding carrots.
- Ellen buys two carrots, a salad (costing $6), and a yogurt ($3).
- Total cost for these three items:
\[ \text{Total Daily Cost} = \$6 + \$3 = \$9 \]

### Step 3: Find out how much Ellen spends on carrots per day.
- Ellen spends $11 in total on her diet items per day.
- Out of this, we have already accounted for $9 for other items.

Therefore, the amount spent on carrots per day is:
\[ \text{Cost per Day on Carrots} = \$11 - \$9 = \$2 \]

### Conclusion:
Ellen pays $2 for one carrot every day.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$2}
\]<|im_end|>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

To determine how much Mark makes in a week after the raise, let's break this down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Mark's original weekly earnings before the raise.
- **Hours worked per day**: 8
- **Days worked per week**: 5
- **Original hourly wage**: $10

\[ \text{Weekly earnings before raise} = (\text{Hours per day}) \times (\text{Days per week}) \times (\text{Hourly wage}) \]

\[ \text{Weekly earnings before raise} = (8) \times (5) \times (10) \]

\[ \text{Weekly earnings before raise} = 400 \]

### Step 2: Determine the new hourly wage after the raise.
- **Raise amount per hour**: $2
- **New hourly wage**:

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = \text{Original hourly wage} + \text{Raise amount per hour} \]

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = 10 + 2 \]

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = 12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week.
- **Hours worked per day**: 8
- **Days worked per week**: 5

\[ \text{Total hours per week} = (\text{Hours per day}) \times (\text{Days per week}) \]

\[ \text{Total hours per week} = (8) \times (5) \]

\[ \text{Total hours per week} = 40 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Mark's new weekly earnings based on the new hourly wage.
- **New hourly wage**: $12
- **Total hours worked per week**: 40

\[ \text{Weekly earnings after raise} = (\text{Total hours per week}) \times (\text{New hourly wage}) \]

\[ \text{Weekly earnings after raise} = (40) \times (12) \]

\[ \text{Weekly earnings after raise} = 480 \]

### Final Answer:
Mark now makes $480 a week after the raise. The final answer is $\boxed{480}$.<|im_end|>","He works 8*5=<<8*5=40>>40 hours a week

                    Last month, Tasha made , $80 from selling ! lemonade ; and ? mowing lawns. The first week, she ? mowed , Kamala's lawn . thrice as many times as she : did ! Joe's.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Tasha made from selling lemonade last month. We know that Tasha also made money from mowing lawns, but we don't have enough information to calculate it directly. However, we can use the given information about Joe's payment to find out how much Tasha made from mowing lawns.

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Tasha earned:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Joe's lawn three times more than Kamala's, she mowed Joe's lawn \( 3x \) times.
   - She mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \( 5 \times 3x = 15x \) times.
   - The total amount of money Tasha earned from mowing lawns is \( 2x + 5x = 7x \).

2. **Use the information about Joe's payment to find \( x \):**
   - Joe paid Tasha $6 for his work, which means he received 6 units of money from Tasha.
   - Joe's payment represents half of the total amount of money Tasha earned from mowing lawns because he only worked on two weeks (first week and second week).
   - Therefore, \( 7x = 2 \times 6 \), which simplifies to \( 7x = 12 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{12}{7} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of money Tasha made from mowing lawns:**
   - Substitute \( x = \frac{12}{7} \) into the equation \( 7x \):
     \[
     7x = 7 \times \frac{12}{7} = 12
     \]
   So, Tasha made $12 from mowing lawns.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Tasha made:**
   - Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade.
   - Adding the money from mowing lawns gives us:
     \[
     80 + 12 = 92
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{92}
\]<|im_end|>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

To determine Harry's weight, we need to follow the given conditions step by step.

**Step 1: Determine Carl's weight**
Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
- Martin's weight = 55 kg
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 2: Calculate Carl's weight**
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 3: Determine Christian's weight**
Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.
- Carl's weight = 71 kg
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} + 8 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 4: Calculate Christian's weight**
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 5: Determine Harry's weight**
Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
- Christian's weight = 79 kg
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 6: Calculate Harry's weight**
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is \( \boxed{74 \text{ kg}} \).<|im_end|>","Carl’s weight is 55 + 16 = <<55+16=71>>71 kg.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings from renting out his car and then subtract his monthly expenses (car payments) to find his profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - John rents his car out 10 times a month.
   - Each rental session lasts 3 hours.
   - He earns $25 per hour.

   First, let’s calculate the total number of hours John works in a month:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = \text{Number of Rentals} \times \text{Duration per Rental}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Next, calculate his total earnings based on his hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Hours} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 30 \times 25 = \$750
   \]

2. **Subtract Monthly Expenses:**
   - John’s monthly car payment is $500.

   To find his profit, subtract the car payment from his total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Monthly Payment}
   \]
   Substituting the calculated values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 750 - 500 = \$250
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is \(250\).<|im_end|>","He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph has.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially has.
   - Let \( x \) be the additional notebooks Martha buys, where \( x = 5 \).

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement:**
   - According to the problem, Joseph has three times as many notebooks as Martha initially (before any buying). So we can write this relationship as:
     \[
     J = 3M
     \]
   - After Martha buys \( x \) notebooks, her total becomes 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     M + x = 7
     \]

3. **Solve for Initial Number of Notebooks (Martha):**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the equation for the total number of notebooks after Martha buys more:
     \[
     M + 5 = 7
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]

4. **Determine Joseph's Number of Notebooks:**
   - Using the initial number of notebooks Martha had (\( M = 2 \)) in the relationship between Joseph's and Martha's notebooks:
     \[
     J = 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

5. **Calculate the Difference Between Their Numbers of Notebooks:**
   - Now that we know Joseph has 6 notebooks and Martha has 7 notebooks, we calculate how many more notebooks Martha has:
     \[
     7 - 6 = 1
     \]

### Conclusion:
Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

{The final answer is} 1<|im_end|>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks

2. Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
3. Add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis.

Step 1: Determine how far Anis rowed compared to Dijana.
We know that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times as many miles as Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles, Anis rowed:
\[ \text{Anis's distance} = 50 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right) = 50 \times \frac{6}{5} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Step 2: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
From Step 1, Anis rowed 60 miles.

Step 3: Add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis.
Dijana rowed 50 miles, so the total distance rowed by both of them is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Total Cookies Made:**
   Susan made 100 cookies.

2. **Cookies Snuck Away:**
   Her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself.
   
3. **Calculate Remaining Cookies After Husband Takes Some:**
   \[
   100 - 4 = 96 \text{ cookies}

4. **Divide Cookies Equally Among Nephews:**
   There are 7 people (Susan and her 6 nephews) who will share these remaining cookies.
   
5. **Calculate Number of Cookies Each Nephew Gets:**
   \[
   \frac{96}{7} = 13.714285714285714

   Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie in practical terms, each nephew would get approximately 13 cookies, and there would be some leftover cookies that couldn't be divided evenly.

So, each of Susan's nephews gets approximately **13 cookies**. The remainder after dividing exactly among the 7 people would need additional thought or handling depending on how they choose to allocate the leftover cookies.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of pages Denise read on today.
Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages. On today, she read 5 more pages than she did yesterday. Therefore, the number of pages Denise read today can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Pages Denise read today} = \text{Pages Denise read yesterday} + 5
\]

Substitute the value from yesterday:

\[
\text{Pages Denise read today} = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

So, Denise read 15 pages today.

### Step 2: Determine the number of pages Daniel read on today.
On yesterday, Daniel read 13 pages. Since he could not read any pages today, his reading remains the same:

\[
\text{Pages Daniel read today} = 13
\]

So, Daniel also read 13 pages today.

### Step 3: Calculate how many more pages Denise read than Daniel.
Now, let's find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel:

\[
\text{More pages Denise read} = \text{Pages Denise read today} - \text{Pages Daniel read today}
\]

Substitute the values found in steps 1 and 2:

\[
\text{More pages Denise read} = 15 - 13 = 2
\]

Therefore, Denise read 2 more pages than Daniel.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is 2}.<|im_end|>","Denise read 13 + 5 = <<13+5=18>>18 pages today.
She was able to read 10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 pages in all.
So, Denise read 28 - 13 = <<28-13=15>>15 more pages than Daniel.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of people**:
   - Calvin: 1 (himself)
   - His adult wife: 1
   - Two children: 2
   Total = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 people.

2. **Calculate the amount of soup needed for these people**:
   - Each person gets one bowl.
   - Number of bowls required = 4 people * 1 bowl/person = 4 bowls.

3. **Check if there is enough soup in the pot**:
   - The pot can hold either four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.
   - Since we need 4 bowls, which is more than what the pot can hold, we assume he only fills up to the capacity that fits within the pot size.
   
   Therefore, the pot holds enough soup to serve all 4 people without needing to add any additional soup.

4. **Determine how many lunches can be served**:
   - With 4 bowls filled, each serving one bowl per person.
   - We can make 4 lunches because the pot contains exactly 4 bowls worth of soup.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Calvin can serve 4 lunches using the available soup.
   - After 4 lunches, no further meals would be possible with the current amount of soup in the pot.

Therefore, each child will get one lunch from the leftover soup. 

{The final answer is} 1 lunch per child.<|im_end|>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the items and their prices:**
   - Notebook: $1.50 each
   - Ballpen: $0.50 each

2. **Calculate the total cost for the notebooks:**
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - Cost per notebook = $1.50
   - Total cost for notebooks = 5 × $1.50 = $7.50

3. **Calculate the total cost for the ballpen:**
   - Cost per ballpen = $0.50
   - Number of ballpens = 1 (since only one is mentioned)
   - Total cost for ballpen = 1 × $0.50 = $0.50

4. **Add up the costs to find the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for notebooks = $7.50
   - Total cost for ballpen = $0.50
   - Total amount spent = $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00 on his purchase.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to find out how many yards of material it takes to make one small mask and one large mask.

1. **Determine the amount of material needed for one small mask:**
   - Given that 2 yards of material are used for 4 small masks.
   - Therefore, 1 small mask requires \(\frac{2}{4} = 0.5\) yards of material.

2. **Determine the amount of material needed for one large mask:**
   - Given that 2.25 yards of material are used for 3 large masks.
   - Therefore, 1 large mask requires \(\frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75\) yards of material.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of material required for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:

3. **Calculate the material needed for 20 small masks:**
   - Since 1 small mask requires 0.5 yards,
   - For 20 small masks, the requirement is \(20 \times 0.5 = 10\) yards.

4. **Calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:**
   - Since 1 large mask requires 0.75 yards,
   - For 8 large masks, the requirement is \(8 \times 0.75 = 6\) yards.

Finally, sum up both amounts to get the total material needed:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class.<|im_end|>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.

For the small masks, it will take 20 masks x 0.5 yards = <<20*0.5=10>>10 yards of material.
For the large masks, it will take 8 masks x 0.75 yards = <<8*0.75=6>>6 yards of material.

To determine the average price Deepa paid per movie ticket, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa saw:**
   - Deepa watched each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets she saw is \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \).

2. **Determine the total amount Deepa spent on all tickets:**
   - Deepa spent $216 in total.

3. **Calculate the average price per ticket:**
   - The average price per ticket can be found by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of tickets.
   - So, the average price per ticket is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average Price} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Spent}}{\text{Total Number of Tickets}} = \frac{216}{27}
     \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   - Simplifying the fraction:

To determine how much free time Harold has in a day, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Harold spends working**
- Harold sleeps for 10 hours per night.
- Since there are 24 hours in a day, Harold's total sleep time is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) hours.

Next, Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
\[ \text{Hours worked} = \text{Sleep time} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Hours worked} = 20 - 2 = 18 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Harold spends walking his dog**
- Harold walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

So far, Harold spends:
\[ \text{Total work + Dog walk time} = 18 + 1 = 19 \] hours.

**Step 3: Determine the total number of hours in a day**
There are 24 hours in a day.

**Step 4: Subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a day to find the free time**
\[ \text{Free time} = 24 - (\text{Total work + Dog walk}) \]
\[ \text{Free time} = 24 - 19 = 5 \] hours.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of marbles Dean has initially
Dean has 30 marbles.

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles he gives away
- Dean gives away \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his marbles to Jamie.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Adam's current age.
2. Calculate their ages in the past using the given information.

Step 1: Determine Adam's current age

Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we can set up an equation based on the statement ""Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.""

Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age (which is 60), and let \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

According to the problem:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substitute \( D = 60 \):
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]

Add 4 to both sides:
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old.

Step 2: Calculate their ages in the past

Now, we calculate their ages in the past.

- Eight years ago for Duncan:
\[ D_{\text{past}} = 60 - 8 = 52 \]

- Four years ago for Adam:
\[ A_{\text{past}} = 30 - 4 = 26 \]

Step 3: Verify the relationship between their ages

We know from the problem statement that Duncan’s age eight years ago was twice Adam’s age four years ago:
\[ 52 = 2(26) \]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

Step 4: Predict Adam's future age

If Duncan is 60 now, he will be 78 after 8 years (since his age increases linearly over time).

Since Adam is currently 30 years old, in 8 years he will be:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be **38** years old in 8 years.

Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]<|im_end|>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

Let \( B \) represent the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm. According to the information given:
\[ B = 200 \text{ acres} \]

Step 2: Calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.
- The formula for Farmer Smith's farm size is:
\[ S = 2B + 100 \]

\[ S = 2(200) + 100 \]

Step 3: Perform the calculation in Step 2.
\[ S = 400 + 100 \]
\[ S = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Step 4: Find the total number of acres for both farms combined.
- To find the total acreage, we add the sizes of both farms:
\[ Total\ Acres = B + S \]
\[ Total\ Acres = 200 + 500 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday and then calculate his earnings based on that number.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of packages completed**

Colby's pay rate is $0.20 per package. He works at a factory where he completes fewer packages than 50 per hour but more than 10 per hour.

Let's denote the number of hours worked as \( h \).

Since he completes fewer than 50 packages per hour but more than 10, let's consider the maximum possible number of packages he could complete in one hour (which would be just under 50) and find out how many hours it takes him to complete these packages.

Assume he completes \( x \) packages per hour where \( 10 < x < 50 \).

Total packages completed = \( x \times h \)

Given that he earns $0.20 for each package, his earnings can be calculated as:

\[ Earnings = 0.20 \times (x \times h) \]

**Step 2: Calculate the time required to complete different numbers of packages**

We know that there are 8 hours in a workday. Let's express the total number of packages in terms of \( x \):

\[ Total\ Packages = x \times h \]
\[ Total\ Packages = 8 \text{ hours} \times x \]

Since he earns $0.20 per package, his earnings can also be expressed as:

\[ Earnings = 0.20 \times (8 \times x) \]

Now, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We will do this by trying different values of \( x \) within the given range and see which one gives us a reasonable number of packages.

For example, if \( x = 11 \):
- Number of packages per hour: \( x = 11 \)
- Time taken to complete 50 packages: \( \frac{50}{11} \approx 4.54 \) hours
- Total packages completed in an eight-hour workday: \( 8 \times 11 \approx 88 \) packages

If \( x = 19 \):
- Time taken to complete 50 packages: \( \frac{50}{19} \approx 2.63 \) hours
- Total packages completed in an eight-hour workday: \( 8 \times 19 \approx 152 \) packages

By continuing this process, you'll notice that the exact value depends on the specific number of packages per hour. However, since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of packages per hour, we should use the general approach to understand the relationship between hours and packages.

**Step 3: Calculate earnings**

Once we have determined the number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday, we multiply this by his pay rate ($0.20 per package) to get his earnings.

Let's assume he completes exactly 17 packages per hour (\( x = 17 \)):
- Time taken to complete 50 packages: \( \frac{50}{17} \approx 2.94 \) hours
- Total packages completed in an eight-hour workday: \( 8 \times 17 = 136 \) packages

Earnings: 
\[ Earnings = 0.20 \times 136 = \$27.20 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$27.20}
\]<|im_end|>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.
At $0.20 per completed package. if he completes 40 packages per hour he earns 40*$0.20=$<<40*0.20=8>>8 per hour.
Thus, in a typical eight-hour day, he earns 8*$8=$<<8*8=64>>64.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much time it takes for John to complete an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**
   - We know that a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes \(4 \times\) as long as a normal one.

2. **Calculate the total time for an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**
   - Time for extreme Sudoku = \(4 \times 45\) minutes = 180 minutes.

3. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine how many bottles of water John drinks per hour:**
   - We know that John drinks a bottle every half-hour.
   - Number of half-hours in 3 hours = \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

5. **Calculate the total number of bottles John drinks in 3 hours:**
   - Since he drinks 1 bottle every half-hour,
     \[
     \text{Total bottles} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>waiter
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of bologna thrown**:
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna on each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna on each yellow balloon.

2. **Calculate the total number of red balloons**:
   - We know that there are 20 red balloons.

3. **Calculate the total number of yellow balloons**:
   - Since each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna (as per the information given), we can calculate the total number of yellow balloons using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total number of yellow balloons} = \frac{\text{Total number of bologna}}{\text{Bologna per yellow balloon}}
     \]
   - Given that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total, we substitute into our equation:
     \[
     \text{Total number of yellow balloons} = \frac{58}{3}
     \]

4. **Perform the division to find the number of yellow balloons**:
   - Divide 58 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{58}{3} = 19.67
     \]
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a balloon, we round up to the nearest whole number because Benny would need to throw an additional piece of bologna for one more balloon if he was able to do so without exceeding the limit. However, since the problem states ""twenty of the balloons were red,"" it implies that he did not exceed his limit but rather finished throwing exactly as described.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 19.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}. 19 of the balloons in the bundle were yellow.<|im_end|>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs over a 30-day period, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in 30 days.
Jon drives 100 miles per day. Therefore, for 30 days, we multiply his daily mileage by the number of days.

\[ \text{Total miles} = \text{Daily miles} \times \text{Number of days} \]

\[ \text{Total miles} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Total miles} = 3000 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many tune-ups Jon needs based on the total miles driven.
According to the information given, Jon needs a tune-up after driving 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he will need, divide the total miles driven by the distance after which a tune-up is needed.

\[ \text{Tune-ups needed} = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{\text{Distance between tune-ups}} \]

\[ \text{Tune-ups needed} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} \]

\[ \text{Tune-ups needed} = 3 \]

### Conclusion:
Jon needs 3 tune-ups over a 30-day period when he drives 100 miles per day.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday). Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the time Bruce works on Wednesday:**
   - Bruce works 5 hours on Tuesday.
   - On Wednesday, he works twice the amount he worked on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Wednesday = \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the time Bruce works on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than what he worked on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the time worked on Thursday = \( 10 - 2 = 8 \) hours.

3. **Sum up the total working hours over the three days:**
   - Tuesday: 5 hours
   - Wednesday: 10 hours
   - Thursday: 8 hours
   - Total working hours = \( 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \) hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce works in all three days is 23. The final answer is {The final answer is} 23.<|im_end|>","On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, let's break down the expenses they made:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.
1. **Cake**: Cost = $11
2. **Balloons**: Cost per balloon = $0.5, Number of balloons = 12 (since it's a dozen)
   - Total cost for balloons = $0.5 × 12 = $6
3. **Ice Cream**: Each tub costs $7, Number of tubs = 2
   - Total cost for ice cream = $7 × 2 = $14

Now, add up all these costs to find out the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \$11 + \$6 + \$14 = \$31 \]

#### Step 2: Determine the total amount spent by both girls.
Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances and this total equals the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total Allowance Given} = \$31 \]

#### Step 3: Divide the total allowance equally between Julia and Nadine.
Given that the allowance was divided equally between the two girls:
\[ \text{Amount Given to Each} = \frac{\$31}{2} = \$15.5 \]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $15.5.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{15.5}

   - Kira bought 3 apples.
   - She also bought 5 bananas.

                          = 14 fruits

2. **Determine how many fruits were eaten:**
   Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

3. **Subtract the number of fruits eaten from the total number of fruits:**
   Number of fruits left = Total number of fruits - Number of fruits eaten
                        = 14 - 2

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students participating in different sports. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of volleyball players.
We know there are twice as many volleyball players as tennis players. Given that there are 6 tennis players, we can calculate the number of volleyball players as follows:

\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times \text{Tennis players} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of volleyball players.
Since there are 16 students in total, and we have already accounted for the 6 tennis players and 12 volleyball players, we can find out how many students play soccer by subtracting these from the total:

\[ \text{Total students (Tennis + Volleyball)} = 16 \]
\[ \text{Remaining students (Soccer)} = 16 - (\text{Tennis players} + \text{Volleyball players}) \]
\[ \text{Remaining students (Soccer)} = 16 - (6 + 12) = 16 - 18 = -2 \]

It seems like there might be an error since we cannot have negative students. Let's re-evaluate our steps.

### Re-evaluation:
Given the correct setup, if we start again with the total number of students being 30 (as per the problem statement), then:

\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times \text{Tennis players} \]
\[ \text{Tennis players} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, let's check the remaining students after accounting for the volleyball players:

\[ \text{Total students (Tennis + Volleyball)} = 30 \]
\[ \text{Remaining students (Soccer)} = 30 - (\text{Tennis players} + \text{Volleyball players}) \]
\[ \text{Remaining students (Soccer)} = 30 - (10 + 20) = 30 - 30 = 0 \]

This indicates that all students are either playing tennis or volleyball. Since the problem states ""If each student only participates in one, group,"" we should consider the possibility that some students could switch between sports based on their preferences. However, without additional information about preferences, we must assume they stay within their respective groups.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total number of students participating in the given sports is **30**.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 students playing volleyball.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
Each student sold 10 lollipops.

Total number of students = 30
Number of lollipops per student = 10

Total number of lollipops sold = Total number of students × Number of lollipops per student
= 30 × 10
= 300 lollipops

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated from selling the lollipops.
Cost per lollipop = $0.8

Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold × Cost per lollipop
= 300 × $0.8
= $240

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost incurred in buying the lollipops.
Cost per lollipop = $0.5

Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold × Cost per lollipop
= 300 × $0.5
= $150

### Step 4: Calculate the profit made from selling the lollipops.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $240 - $150
= $90

### Final Answer:
The class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.<|im_end|>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

### Step 3: Determine the number of fish Larry has.
He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.

\[ \text{Number of fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pets Larry has.
Now we sum up all his pet types.

\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{cats} + \text{dogs} + \text{rabbits} + \text{fish} \]
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 \]
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 30 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Larry has **30** pets in total.<|im_end|>","Larry has 3 cats and 3 times as many dogs as cats, for 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 dogs
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than his 9 dogs, for 9-2=7 rabbits

Larry has 1 /3 as many gerbils as he has fish, for 21/3= 7 gerbils
Adding these all together, he has 9+7+21+7+3= <<9+7+21+7+3=47>>47 pets

                    question:
                    A loaf of bread : has : 24 slices. If Abby can eat 2 , slices a ; day while Josh ; can eat twice as ? much, how ; many days ; will the loaf ! of bread last?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how long the loaf of bread will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of slices in the loaf.
2. Determine how many slices Abby and Josh can consume together per day.
3. Divide the total number of slices by their combined daily consumption.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Slices
The problem states that there are 24 slices in one loaf of bread.

### Step 2: Determine Combined Daily Consumption
- Abby eats 2 slices per day.
- Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.

Together, they consume \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

### Step 3: Divide the Total Number of Slices by Their Combined Daily Consumption
To find out how many days the loaf will last, we divide the total number of slices (24) by their combined daily consumption (6):

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of slices}}{\text{Combined daily consumption}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for **4 days**.<|im_end|>","Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.
Together, Abby and Josh can eat 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.
So, a loaf of bread will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many shells Martha has collected over time based on the information provided.

Step 1: Determine when Martha started collecting shells.
- The problem states that Martha began collecting shells at age 5.

Step 2: Calculate the number of months between now (the current year) and her 10th birthday.
- From age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years.
- Each year has 12 months.
- Therefore, from age 5 to age 10, there are \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Step 3: Determine how many shells Martha collects per month.
- According to the problem, Martha collects one shell per month.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of shells collected in 60 months.
- Since she collects one shell per month for 60 months, she will collect \(60\) shells.

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected **60** shells. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 60.<|im_end|>","In 12 months of the year, Martha collects 12 * 1 = <<12*1=12>>12 shells.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of cups**: Lana starts with 27 cups.
2. **Number of rows**: She divides these into 3 rows.
   - Number of cups per row = Total cups / Number of rows = 27 / 3 = 9 cups per row.

Now we know that there are 9 cups in each row. Let's move on to the next part:

3. **Cups used for cinnamon tea**:
   - Lana uses the remaining cups (after dividing them into 3 rows) to make a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.
4. **Remaining cups after making cinnamon tea**: 
   - Cups left = Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups = 27 - 15 = 12 cups.
5. **Cups of chamomile tea in each row**:
   - Since there are 3 rows and 9 cups in each row, the number of chamomile cups per row = 9.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 9.

{The final answer is} The number of cups of mint tea in each row is 9.<|im_end|>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total time available for picking berries:**
   The sloth has 8 hours to pick berries.

2. **Calculate the time spent climbing down the tree:**
   It takes 4 hours to go down the tree to pick berries.
   
3. **Calculate the remaining time after climbing down:**
   Remaining time = Total time - Time spent climbing down
                  = 8 hours - 4 hours
                  = 4 hours

4. **Calculate the time spent climbing back up:**
   It takes another 4 hours to climb back up the tree.
   
5. **Calculate the total time taken for one complete round trip:**
   One complete round trip (down and back) takes 4 + 4 = 8 hours.
   
6. **Determine how many times the sloth can perform this round trip in 8 hours:**
   Number of trips = Total time available / Time for one trip
                   = 8 hours / 8 hours
                   = 1 trip
   
7. **Since we want to collect exactly 24 berries in 8 hours, calculate the minimum number of berries needed per trip:**
   If the sloth collects berries at the same rate throughout the trip, then the total number of berries collected must be equal to the number of trips multiplied by the number of berries picked per trip.
   Let \( x \) be the number of berries picked per trip.
   Then, \( 1 \times x = 24 \).
   Therefore, \( x = 24 \).

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick per trip, assuming it picks the same number of berries on each trip, is 24.<|im_end|>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of water in the pool.
2. Calculate the volume of water used from the tank over 6 days.
3. Subtract the used volume from the initial amount in the pool.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Total Amount of Water in the Pool
We know there are 10000 gallons of water in the pool.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of Water Used from the Tank Over 6 Days
Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, they add:
\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

They then use water from the tank at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days. So, the total volume of water used from the tank is:
\[ 500 \times 6 = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

#### Step 3: Subtract the Used Volume from the Initial Amount in the Pool
After using 3000 gallons from the tank, the remaining volume of water in the tank is:
\[ 5000 - 3000 = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is **2000**.<|im_end|>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many movies Colby can see given his budget and ticket prices.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Initial Setup:
- Colby has $150 per month.
- Each movie ticket costs $10 (Friday) or $7 (other days).
- Colby needs to buy popcorn ($8), a box of candy ($2), and two tubs of popcorn ($8).

#### Calculating Total Cost Per Movie:
- Let \( n \) be the number of movies Colby can afford in a month.

**Cost per movie:**
- **For a Friday:** 
  - Ticket price = $10
  - Popcorn = $8
  - Candy = $2
  - Total cost per movie = $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

- **For an Other Day:**
  - Ticket price = $7
  - Popcorn = $8
  - Candy = $2
  - Total cost per movie = $7 + $8 + $2 = $17

#### Total Budget Calculation:
Colby's total monthly budget is $150.

#### Breakdown Based on Number of Movies:
- For each movie, Colby will have:
  - Remaining money after buying tickets: \( 150 - n \times \text{total cost per movie} \)
  
Let’s assume Colby decides to watch \( x \) movies on Fridays and \( y \) movies on other days.

### Case 1: Watching Only Fridays:
If Colby watches only on Fridays, then he would not buy popcorn or candy because those items are not available on Fridays.

- Total cost for one Friday movie: $10
- Remaining budget after one Friday movie: \( 150 - 10n \)

Since Colby already watched 5 movies on Fridays, let's check how much he can still save:
\[ 150 - 10 \times 5 = 150 - 50 = 100 \]

Now, considering he also buys popcorn and candy:
- Cost for popcorn: $8
- Cost for candy: $2
- Total additional cost for popcorn and candy = $8 + $2 = $10

So, remaining budget after buying all these items:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

Thus, Colby can still afford \( \frac{90}{17} \approx 5.29 \) more movies. Since he cannot buy partial movies, he can watch 5 more movies on Fridays.

### Case 2: Watching Some On Fridays and Others On Other Days:
- Let \( n_f \) be the number of Fridays he can watch.
- Let \( n_o \) be the number of other days he can watch.

Total movies he can watch = \( n_f + n_o \).

Remaining budget after watching \( n_f \) movies on Fridays:
\[ 150 - 10n_f \]

Remaining budget after buying popcorn and candy:
\[ 150 - 10n_f - 10 = 140 - 10n_f \]

Given he has 2 tubs of popcorn and 4 boxes of candy left:
\[ 140 - 10n_f - 2 \times 8 - 4 \times 2 \leq 150 \]
\[ 140 - 10n_f - 16 - 8 \leq 150 \]
\[ 126 - 10n_f \leq 150 \]
\[ 10n_f \geq 14 \]
\[ n_f \geq 1.4 \]

Since \( n_f \) must be an integer, \( n_f \geq 2 \). 

Therefore, if he watches 2 or more movies on Fridays, he will have enough money to buy popcorn and candy without exceeding his budget.

### Conclusion:
- If he watches only 2 or more movies on Fridays, he can watch up to 8 more movies on other days without exceeding his budget.

So, the maximum number of movies Colby can watch is \( 5 + 8 = 13 \).

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{13}}
\]<|im_end|>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of calories in all the pastries that Andrew baked. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of mini, cinnamon rolls, and blueberry muffins
- Mini pastry: 200
- Cinnamon rolls: 300
- Blueberry muffin: 100 (since there are three types of pastries, one for each type)

### Step 2: Determine the calorie content of each type of pastry
- Normal cinnamon roll: 600 calories
- Normal blueberry muffin: 450 calories
- Mini pastry = 1/3 of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll
  \[
  \text{Calories per mini pastry} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total calories for each type of pastry
- Mini pastries: \(200 \times 200\) 
  \[
  \text{Total calories for mini pastries} = 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories}
  \]
- Cinnamon rolls: \(300 \times 600\)
  \[
  \text{Total calories for cinnamon rolls} = 300 \times 600 = 180000 \text{ calories}
  \]
- Blueberry muffins: \(100 \times 450\)
  \[
  \text{Total calories for blueberry muffins} = 100 \times 450 = 45000 \text{ calories}
  \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total calories from all pastries
\[
\text{Total calories} = 40000 + 180000 + 45000 = 275000 \text{ calories}
\]

Therefore, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is **275000**.<|im_end|>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories

<|im_start|>user
To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days:**
   - Monday: 39 Junebugs
   - Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday = \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - Wednesday: Twice as many as Monday = \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - Thursday: 48 Junebugs
   - Friday: 57 Junebugs

   Adding these together gives us the total number of Junebugs removed:
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   There are 5 days in total.

   To find the average, divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average} = 60

                    A bus travels 60 miles per ; hour for 5 hours. A car ; travels ? 30 ; miles ; per hour ? for 8 : hours. How much farther ; did the bus go , than the car, in miles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both the bus and the car, then find the difference between these distances.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the bus:**
   - The formula for distance is given by \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - For the bus, the speed is 60 miles per hour (mph) and the time is 5 hours.
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**
   - The speed of the car is 30 mph and the time is 8 hours.
   - Using the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Determine how much farther the bus went compared to the car:**
   - Subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.
   - \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}}
   \]
   - Substituting the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is {The bus went 60 miles farther than the car}.<|im_end|>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

                    question:
                    ; When Sophie watches her nephew, : she gets out a variety ! of toys ? for him. The . bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in , it.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bouncy balls Sophie got from the tube. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of Toys Currently:**
   - Building blocks: 31
   - Stuffed animals: 8
   - Rings: 9 (multicolored)
   - Bouncy balls: Total number of toys = 62

2. **Sum of Known Toys:**
   \[
   \text{Total known toys} = 31 + 8 + 9 = 48
   \]

3. **Finding the Number of Bouncy Balls:**
   - Since the total number of toys Sophie has now is 62, we can find the number of bouncy balls by subtracting the sum of other toys from the total.
   \[
   \text{Number of bouncy balls} = \text{Total number of toys} - \text{Sum of known toys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of bouncy balls} = 62 - 48 = 14
   \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is \( \boxed{14} \).<|im_end|>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.
After buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.
Thus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.

                    question:
                    The combined : age of Peter, Paul and Jean . is 100 years ? old. Find the . age of , Peter : knowing that ; Paul is 10 years older ! than John and that ? Peter’s age is equal , to . the sum , of Paul and John's age.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define the ages of Peter (P), Paul (Pau), and Jean (Jean) as follows:

Let:
- P = Peter's age,
- Pau = Paul's age,
- Jean = Jean's age.

We know from the problem statement that:
1. The total combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so if we denote John's age as J, then Paul's age can be represented as Pau = J + 10.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages, which means P = Pau + J.

Given these conditions, we need to find Peter's age.

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

1. **Total Age Equation**:
   \[
   P + Pau + Jean = 100
   \]

2. **Paul's Age in Terms of John's Age**:
   Since Paul is 10 years older than John, we have:
   \[
   Pau = J + 10
   \]
   
3. **Peter's Age in Terms of Paul and John's Ages**:
   According to the given condition, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages:
   \[
   P = Pau + J
   \]
   
4. **Substitute Paul's Age into Total Age Equation**:
   Substitute \( Pau = J + 10 \) into the total age equation:
   \[
   P + (J + 10) + Jean = 100
   \]

5. **Simplify the Equation**:
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   P + J + 10 + Jean = 100
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   P + J + Jean = 90
   \]

6. **Substitute John's Age into Simplified Equation**:
   From the second piece of information, we know that:
   \[
   Pau = J + 10
   \]
   So, substituting \( Pau = J + 10 \) back into the simplified equation gives us:
   \[
   P + (J + 10) + Jean = 90
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   P + J + 10 + Jean = 90
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   P + J + Jean = 80
   \]

7. **Combine Like Terms**:
   We already know from the first part that:
   \[
   P + Pau + Jean = 100
   \]
   Substituting \( Pau = J + 10 \):
   \[
   P + (J + 10) + Jean = 100
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   P + J + 10 + Jean = 100
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   P + J + Jean = 90
   \]

8. **Equate and Solve for P**:
   Equate the two expressions for \( P + J + Jean \):
   \[
   90 = 80
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   P = 20
   \]

So, Peter's age is 20 years.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is: } 20}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many water balloons Maria initially gives to her friends:**
   - Maria has 4 friends.
   - Each friend gets 2 water balloons.

\[
4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
\]

2. **Calculate the number of water balloons left for Maria after giving them to her friends:**

\[
10 \text{ (total)} - 8 \text{ (given away)} = 2 \text{ balloons remaining for Maria}
\]

3. **Add the additional balloons given by Maria's mom:**

- Her mom gives each person 3 more balloons.

\[
\text{Number of people} = 5 \text{ (Maria + her 4 friends)}
\]
\[
\text{Total additional balloons from mom} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ balloons}
\]

4. **Sum up all the balloons:**

\[
2 \text{ (remaining for Maria)} + 15 \text{ (from mom)} = 17 \text{ total balloons}

To determine the average total distance that Zoey and Sydney spit their seeds, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance for Zoey
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- She spits each seed 10 feet.

Total distance Zoey spits = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
\[ \text{Total distance Zoey} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for Sydney
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- She spits each seed 12 feet.

Total distance Sydney spits = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
\[ \text{Total distance Sydney} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 3: Find the sum of the total distances
Sum of the total distances = Total distance Zoey + Total distance Sydney
\[ \text{Sum of distances} = 400 + 420 = 820 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of participants
Both Zoey and Sydney participate in the competition, so there are 2 participants.

### Step 5: Calculate the average distance
Average distance = Sum of distances / Number of participants
\[ \text{Average distance} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the average total distance spat by both contestants is **410 feet**.<|im_end|>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much more money Fern would make per month using the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of widgets produced in one month:**
   - The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
   - It operates for 24 hours a day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.

   \[
   \text{Widgets per month} = (\text{widgets per hour}) \times (\text{hours per day}) \times (\text{days per month})
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Widgets per month} = 60 \times 24 \times 30
   \]

   First, multiply the daily production by the number of days in the month:

   \[
   60 \times 24 = 1440
   \]

   Then, multiply this result by the number of months:

   \[
   1440 \times 30 = 432000
   \]

   So, the Widgeteer 3000 produces 432,000 widgets in a month.

2. **Calculate the revenue generated by the Widgeteer 3000:**

   - Each widget sells for $6.

   \[
   \text{Revenue per month (Widgeteer)} = \text{Widgets per month} \times \text{Price per widget}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Revenue per month (Widgeteer)} = 432000 \times 6
   \]

   Calculate the total revenue:

   \[
   432000 \times 6 = 2592000
   \]

   So, the Widgeteer 3000 generates $2,592,000 in revenue over a month.

3. **Calculate the number of widgets produced in one month by the WidgetMaster 9000:**

   - The WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.
   - It also operates for 24 hours a day.
   - Again, there are 30 days in the month.

   \[
   \text{Widgets per month (WidgetMaster)} = (\text{widgets per hour}) \times (\text{hours per day}) \times (\text{days per month})
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Widgets per month (WidgetMaster)} = 45 \times 24 \times 30
   \]

   First, multiply the daily production by the number of days in the month:

   \[
   45 \times 24 = 1080
   \]

   Then, multiply this result by the number of months:

   \[
   1080 \times 30 = 32400
   \]

   So, the WidgetMaster 9000 produces 32,400 widgets in a month.

4. **Calculate the revenue generated by the WidgetMaster 9000:**

   - Each widget sells for $6.

   \[
   \text{Revenue per month (WidgetMaster)} = \text{Widgets per month} \times \text{Price per widget}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Revenue per month (WidgetMaster)} = 32400 \times 6
   \]

   Calculate the total revenue:

   \[
   32400 \times 6 = 194400
   \]

   So, the WidgetMaster 9000 generates $194,400 in revenue over a month.

5. **Determine the difference in revenue between the two machines:**

   \[
   \text{Difference in revenue} = \text{Revenue per month (WidgetMaster)} - \text{Revenue per month (Widgeteer)}
   \]

   Substituting the calculated values:

   \[
   \text{Difference in revenue} = 194400 - 2592000
   \]

   Calculate the difference:

   \[
   194400 - 2592000 = -2397600
   \]

So, Fern will make $239,760 less from the WidgetMaster 9000 than from the Widgeteer 30","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month
Then multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to compare his total cost under both options.

### Option 1: Paying for 12 hours
- **Cost Calculation**: 
  - The first 12 hours cost $1,000.
  - Additional costs for any hours beyond 12 will be charged at $70 per extra hour.

Since Cameron plans to stay until 10 AM the next day, he stays for 8 more hours (from 12 PM onwards).

\[ \text{Additional Cost} = 8 \times 70 = 560 \]

So, the total cost for 12-hour stay:
\[ 1,000 + 560 = 1,560 \]

### Option 2: Adding 70 pesos for each hour over 12 hours
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - First 12 hours cost $1,000.
  - Any hours past 12 will be charged at $70 per extra hour.

Cameron's stay is from 5 PM the current day to 10 AM the next day, which totals 8 hours.

\[ \text{Total Hours Stayed} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Hours Over 12} = 8 \]

For the remaining hours:
\[ \text{Cost Per Extra Hour} = 70 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost for Remaining Hours} = 8 \times 70 = 560 \]

So, the total cost for this option:
\[ 1,000 + 560 = 1,560 \]

### Comparison and Savings:
- **Option 1 Total Cost**: $1,560
- **Option 2 Total Cost**: $1,560

Therefore, Cameron saves nothing because both options result in the same total cost.

\[

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of hay needed for one goat.
Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.

### Step 2: Determine the amount of hay needed for one sheep.
We know that each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs.

- Twice the amount of hay needed for a goat = \(2 \times 5\) pounds.
- Subtract 3 pounds from that total to get the amount needed for a sheep.

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the goats.
Multiply the number of goats by the amount of hay each goat needs.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all the sheep.
Multiply the number of sheep by the amount of hay each sheep needs.

### Step 5: Add the amounts from Step 3 and Step 4 together to get the total amount of hay needed.

Let's go ahead and do these calculations.

#### Calculating the amount of hay needed for one sheep:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \] pounds.

So, each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay.

#### Total amount of hay needed for all goats:
\[ 15 \text{ goats} \times 5 \text{ pounds/each} = 75 \text{ pounds} \].

#### Total amount of hay needed for all sheep:
\[ 12 \text{ sheep} \times 7 \text{ pounds/each} = 84 \text{ pounds} \].

#### Final calculation:
\[ 75 \text{ pounds (goats)} + 84 \text{ pounds (sheep)} = 159 \text{ pounds} \].

Therefore, Nate needs **159 pounds** of hay in total.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep

Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate John's total earnings for the week**

John earns $50 per hour and works for 6 hours.

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$50/hour \times 6 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$300 \]

**Step 2: Subtract expenses from his total earnings**

John spends $50 on gas.

\[ \text{Remaining After Gas} = \$300 - \$50 \]

\[ \text{Remaining After Gas} = \$250 \]

**Step 3: Determine how much John has left after buying the 5 pencils**

Each pencil costs $10, so 5 pencils will cost:

\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \$10/pencil \times 5 \text{ pencils} \]

\[ \text{Cost of Pencils} = \$50 \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from what he has left:

\[ \text{Remaining After Buying Pencils} = \$250 - \$50 \]

\[ \text{Remaining After Buying Pencils} = \$200 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many pens John can buy with the remaining amount**

Each pen costs $25, so we divide the remaining money by the price of one pen:

\[ \text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\$200}{\$25/\text{pen}} \]

\[ \text{Number of Pens} = 8 \]

So, John can buy **8** pens with the remaining money.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Craig has spelled out 20 words, each containing 15 letters.
- The total number of letters Craig has spelled is \(20 \times 15 = 300\) letters.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of letters in all words combined
Since there were 10 rounds and Craig has spelled out 20 words per round, the total number of words spelled is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) words.

Let \(x\) be the average number of letters in each word that both Craig and his brother have spelled out together. Since there are 20 words from each person, the total number of letters is:
\[200x\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of letters between Craig and his brother
Craig has spelled out 300 letters (as calculated earlier), so we need to find how many letters his brother has spelled. Let \(y\) be the number of letters in the words his brother has spelled out. According to the problem, his brother has 50 more letters than Craig:
\[y = 300 + 50 = 350\]

### Step 4: Find the total number of letters in the words spelled by both
The total number of letters in the words spelled by both Craig and his brother is:
\[200x + y = 200x + 350\]

### Step 5: Solve for \(x\)
We know that the total number of letters is also equal to \(200x\). Therefore:
\[200x + 350 = 200x\]
This equation simplifies to:
\[350 = 0\]
which is not possible. This indicates an error in our approach. Let’s re-evaluate the setup.

### Correct Approach:
Given the total number of letters is 300, if Craig has 20 words of 15 letters each, he has spelled out \(20 \times 15 = 300\) letters. His brother has spelled out words such that his total is 50 more than Craig's. We can denote the number of words his brother has as \(n\) and the average number of letters per word as \(x\). So:
\[nx = 300\]
And:
\[n(x+1) = 350\]

From the second equation:
\[n = \frac{350}{x+1}\]

Substituting \(n\) in the first equation:
\[\left(\frac{350}{x+1}\right)x = 300\]
Simplifying:
\[350x = 300(x+1)\]
\[350x = 300x + 300\]
\[50x = 300\]
\[x = 6\]

So, the number of letters in each of Craig's words is 15, and since the total number of letters is 300, the total number of letters in the words their brother has spelled out is:
\[200 \times 6 = 1200\]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[300 + 1200 = 1500\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1500}
\]<|im_end|>","After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.
Since Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of 50 more letters than Craig's words, he got 300+50 = 350 letters.
The brothers spelled out words with a total count of 350+300 = <<350+300=650>>650 letters.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find out how many children will participate in the mass drill.
   - The number of children is represented by ""children"".
   - The total number of rows is given as 7.
   - Each row contains 8 children.

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Children:**
   - First, we calculate the total number of children based on the number of rows and the number of children per row.
     \[
     \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Children per row}
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of children} = 7 \times 8
     \]

3. **Performing the Multiplication:**
   - Now, multiply 7 by 8:
     \[
     7 \times 8 = 56
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the total number of children that can participate in the drill is 56.

   - Each coupon allows redemption for 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - The teacher has 9 coupons.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles she can get from her coupons is \( 9 \times 100 = 900 \) bottles.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given to the students:**
   - There are 29 students.
   - Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.
   - So, the total number of bottles given out is \( 29 \times 2 = 58 \) bottles.

3. **Subtract the number of bottles used for the students from the total number of bottles available:**
   - The remaining number of bottles after distributing to the students is \( 900 - 58 = 842 \).

Therefore, the teacher will have 842 bottles of apple juice left for herself.

To determine how much Patty charged for her service, we need to break down the costs into their components: labor cost and parts cost.

1. **Calculate the total labor cost:**
   - The labor rate is $35 per hour.
   - The time spent on the job was 2.25 hours.
   
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 2.25 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discount.
James buys 10 CDs at their original price.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times \$15 = \$150 \]

### Step 2: Apply the discount.
James gets the CDs for 40% off.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 150 \times 0.40 = \$60 \]

\[ \text{Final Price After Discount} = 150 - 60 = \$90 \]

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Jen will earn if she sells all her root crops, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling each type of crop separately and then sum these amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling the yams**
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam sells for $1.5.
- Revenue from yams = Number of yams × Price per yam
\[ \text{Revenue from yams} = 6 \times 1.5 = \$9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the sweet potatoes**
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato sells for $2.
- Revenue from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes × Price per sweet potato
\[ \text{Revenue from sweet potatoes} = 10 \times 2 = \$20 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the carrots**
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot sells for $1.25.
- Revenue from carrots = Number of carrots × Price per carrot
\[ \text{Revenue from carrots} = 4 \times 1.25 = \$5 \]

**Step 4: Sum up the revenues from all types of crops**
Total earnings = Revenue from yams + Revenue from sweet potatoes + Revenue from carrots
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34 \]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn a total of **$34**.<|im_end|>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break down James's journey into different segments and calculate the time taken for each segment. Let's do this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance James needs to swim:**
   James needs to swim across a 20-mile lake.

2. **Determine how much distance James swims in one session (60%):**
   \( \text{Distance swum} = 20 \times 0.6 = 12 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the time taken to swim 12 miles at his given speed:**
   His swimming speed is 2 miles per hour.
   Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the rest time after swimming 12 miles:**
   Rest time = Half the swimming time = \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.

5. **Calculate the remaining distance after resting:**
   Remaining distance = Total distance - Swam distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance at twice his swimming speed:**
   Since he swims half the speed, his new swimming speed is \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) mile per hour.
   Time to swim 8 miles = Distance / New Speed = \( \frac{8}{1} = 8 \) hours.

7. **Calculate the total time taken for the entire trip:**
   Total time = Swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time
   Total time = 6 hours (first session) + 3 hours (rest) + 8 hours (remaining distance)
   Total time = 17 hours.

Therefore, the total time it took James to get across the lake is **17 hours**.<|im_end|>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.

He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                    question:
                    A bakery has . 40 : less : than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. ? If Sam . had seventy loaves of : bread , last Friday, ! how ! many ; loaves of bread does the bakery have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the number of loaves Sam had last Friday and the number of loaves in the bakery:**
   - The bakery has \(. 40 : less :\) more loaves than seven times the number of loaves Sam had.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of loaves Sam had last Friday.

2. **Express the relationship mathematically:**
   - Seven times the number of loaves Sam had equals \( 7S \).
   - The bakery has \( 7S + x \) where \( x \) represents the difference (which is ""less"" than 40).

3. **Set up an equation to find \( x \):**
   - According to the given information, the bakery has \( 7S + x \) loaves, which is equal to \(\text{some value} \times (\text{seven times } S)\), but we need to express \( x \) as something relative to 40.
   - We know that \( x = 7S - 40 \).

4. **Substitute \( x \) back into the total number of loaves at the bakery:**
   - Total loaves at the bakery = \( 7S + x \)
   - Substitute \( x \):
     \[
     \text{Total loaves at the bakery} = 7S + (7S - 40)
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Total loaves at the bakery} = 14S - 40
     \]

5. **Determine the number of loaves Sam had last Friday:**
   - Given that Sam had 70 loaves last Friday, substitute \( S = 70 \):
     \[
     \text{Total loaves at the bakery} = 14 \times 70 - 40
     \]
     Calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total loaves at the bakery} = 980 - 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total loaves at the bakery} = 940
     \]

### Conclusion:
The bakery has 940 loaves of bread.

Thus, the final answer is \boxed{940}.<|im_end|>","If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total commission Cayley earns from selling both the New York Times (NYT) and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). We'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Commission for the NYT Sales
- **Number of NYT Copies Sold**: 6
- **Cost per NYT Copy**: $5
- **Commission Rate for NYT**: 10%

**Formula**:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = (\text{Number of Copies}) \times (\text{Cost per Copy}) \times (\text{Commission Rate}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 6 \times 5 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 30 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 3 \]

So, Cayley earns a total commission of $3 from the sale of 6 copies of the NYT.

### Step 2: Calculate the Commission for the WSJ Sales
- **Number of WSJ Copies Sold**: 10
- **Cost per WSJ Copy**: $15
- **Commission Rate for WSJ**: 8%

**Formula**:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = (\text{Number of Copies}) \times (\text{Cost per Copy}) \times (\text{Commission Rate}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 10 \times 15 \times 0.08 \]
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 150 \times 0.08 \]
\[ \text{Total Commission} = 12 \]

So, Cayley earns a total commission of $12 from the sale of 10 copies of the WSJ.

### Step 3: Add the Commissions Together
Cayley's total commission from both sales is the sum of the commissions from the NYT and WSJ.
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \$3 + \$12 \]
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \$15 \]

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $\boxed{\$15}$ from the sales of 6 copies of the NYT and 10 copies of the WSJ.<|im_end|>","He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine Leo's age based on the given information about his relationship to other individuals.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the relationships:**
   - Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
   - Marcus is also five years younger than Deanna.

2. **Determine Deanna's age:**
   - Deanna is 26 years old.

3. **Calculate Marcus' age using Deanna's age:**
   - Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, we can find Marcus’ age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age.
     \[
     \text{Marcus' Age} = 26 - 5 = 21
     \]

4. **Use the relationship between Marcus and Leo:**
   - Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
   - We know Marcus is 21 years old.

5. **Set up an equation to find Leo's age:**
   Let \( L \) represent Leo's age.
   According to the relationship:
   \[
   \frac{L}{2} = 21
   \]

6. **Solve for Leo's age:**
   Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \( L \):
   \[
   L = 21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Leo is 42 years old}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each person scored based on the given relationships between their scores.

Let's denote the number of points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

Given:
1. Bahati scored the most points.
2. Bahati's score (\(B\)) is 20 points more than Azibo's score (\(A\)).
3. Bahati's score (\(B\)) is also 10 points more than Dinar's score (\(D\)).

From these statements, we can set up the following equations:

\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = D + 10 \]

We know that the total points scored by all three individuals is 45, so:
\[ B + A + D = 45 \]

Now, let's substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (A + 20) + 10 = D \]
\[ A + 30 = D \]

Next, substitute both \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the total points equation:
\[ B + A + (A + 30) = 45 \]
\[ B + 2A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ B + 2A = 15 \]

Since \( B \) is the largest score, \( A \) must be less than or equal to \( B \). Also, since \( B \) is 20 points more than \( A \):
\[ B = A + 20 \]

Substitute \( B \) back into the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + 2A = 15 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 20 = 15 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 3A = -5 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = -\frac{5}{3} \]

This result does not make sense because scores cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate our approach. Since Bahati scored the most points, he must have at least 25 points (since \( B > A > D \)). Let's try solving for \( A \):

If Bahati scored 25 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 25 + 20 = 45 \]

So, Bahati scored 45 points. Now, using \( B \) in the total points equation:
\[ 45 + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + D = 0 \]

This implies \( A = 0 \) and \( D = 0 \), but this doesn't fit the condition that Bahati scored the most points. Therefore, Bahati could only have scored 26 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 26 + 20 = 46 \]

Thus, Bahati scored 46 points. Using \( B \) again:
\[ 46 + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + D = -1 \]

This is still incorrect. Let's correct our approach by assuming Bahati scored 28 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 28 + 20 = 48 \]

So, Bahati scored 48 points. Using \( B \) again:
\[ 48 + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + D = -3 \]

This is still incorrect. Let's assume Bahati scored 30 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, Bahati scored 50 points. Using \( B \) again:
\[ 50 + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + D = -5 \]

This is still incorrect. Let's assume Bahati scored 32 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 32 + 20 = 52 \]

So, Bahati scored 52 points. Using \( B \) again:
\[ 52 + A + D = 45 \]
\[ A + D = -7 \]

This is still incorrect. Let's assume Bahati scored 34 points:
\[ B = A + 20 \]
\[ B = 34 + 20 = 54 \]

So, Bahati scored 54","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored
Azibo = B - 20
Dinar = B - 10
B + B -20 + B - 10 = 45
3B - 30 = 45;
3B = 75
B = <<25=25>>25
Azibo = 25 - 20 = <<25-20=5>>5 points
Azibo scored 5 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of sheets per inch**
- We know that the book has 100 pages per inch.
- Since each sheet can have two sides (front and back), we need to find out how many sheets fit in one inch.

Given: 
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Sides per sheet} = 2 \]

So, for one sheet, we have:
\[ \text{Pages per sheet} = 100 / 2 = 50 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of sheets in 1 inch thickness**
- If there are 50 pages per sheet, then in 1 inch thickness, we would have:
\[ \text{Sheets per inch} = 100 \times 2 = 200 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of sheets per inch thickness**
- Now, since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we calculate the total number of sheets:
\[ \text{Total Sheets} = 200 \times 1.5 = 300 \]

**Step 4: Find the total number of pages in the book**
- Given that each sheet contains 50 pages, we multiply the total number of sheets by the number of pages per sheet:
\[ \text{Total Pages} = 300 \times 50 = 15000 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: **15000 pages**.<|im_end|>","There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.

To determine how many reports Vince staples in total, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Vince works.
Vince starts at 8:00 AM and ends at 11:00 PM.

- From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon): 1 hour

- From 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM: 1 hour

Total working hours = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 hours

### Step 2: Determine how many 15-minute intervals fit into the total work period.
Since there are 11 hours of work, and each interval is 15 minutes long, we calculate the number of 15-minute intervals as follows:

\[ \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{\text{Total hours}}{\text{Duration per interval}} = \frac{11}{\frac{1}{4}} = 11 \times 4 = 44 \]

Each interval corresponds to one report Vince staples.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of reports Vince staples.
Since Vince staples 30 reports per interval, we multiply this by the total number of intervals:

\[ \text{Total reports} = 30 \times 44 = 1320 \]

Therefore, Vince staples a total of **1320 reports** over the course of his 11-hour work shift.<|im_end|>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).

### Step 2: Calculate the duration of sleep walking
Kim was awake for 13 minutes while sleepwalking.

### Step 3: Subtract the sleepwalking time from the total sleep duration
Now, subtract the 13-minute sleepwalking period from the total 420 minutes of sleep:
\[ 420 \text{ minutes} - 13 \text{ minutes} = 407 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Kim actually slept for **407 minutes** on that particular day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the relationship between spoons and cups:**
   - Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many spoons as cups.

2. **Calculate the number of cups Jonathan has:**
   - He has 2 dozen cups.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).
   - Therefore, Jonathan has 24 cups.

3. **Calculate the number of spoons Jonathan has based on the given ratio:**
   - According to the ratio \( \frac{2}{3} \), if he has 24 cups, then he has \( \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \).

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
\]

So, Jonathan has 16 spoons.

4. **Add the additional spoons gifted to him:**
   - He receives 6 more spoons for his birthday.

\[
16 + 6 = 22

Jonathan now has a total of 22 spoons.

5. **Sum up all the utensils Jonathan has:**
   - We need to add the spoons and cups together.

22 \text{ (spoons)} + 24 \text{ (cups)} = 46
\]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has is 46.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is 46.<|im_end|>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                    question:
                    A ; hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due . to the . coronavirus outbreak, ? 50 patients : are admitted into the , hospital each day. Calculate the ! total ? number of unoccupied . beds , in the ; hospital after 2 weeks.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate initial occupancy:**
   - The hospital initially has a capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Half of these beds are occupied due to an ongoing infection (1/5).
   
   \[
   \text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
   \]

2. **Calculate daily admissions:**
   - 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.

3. **Calculate daily decrease in unoccupied beds:**
   - Each day, 50 new patients are added, but some of them will be accommodated if there are enough available beds.
   - Since the hospital can only accommodate 200 patients at any given time, we need to consider how many more patients can be accommodated than those that have already been admitted.

4. **Determine maximum number of additional patients that can be accommodated:**
   - The remaining unoccupied beds after the current admission are \( 1000 - 200 = 800 \) beds.
   - If all 50 new admissions were made within the hospital's capacity, then no additional beds would become available for future admissions until the next admission cycle.

5. **Calculate total number of days in two weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in one week.
   - Two weeks make up 14 days.

6. **Calculate total admissions over two weeks:**
   - Daily admissions: 50 per day.
   - Total admissions over 14 days: 
   
   \[
   \text{Total admissions} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients}
   \]

7. **Calculate total unoccupied beds after two weeks:**
   - After two weeks, the number of occupied beds remains unchanged as they do not change based on the number of admissions during that period.
   - Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds after two weeks is still 200 beds since the hospital’s capacity limits the number of patients it can accommodate.

**Final Answer:**  
The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after two weeks is **200**.<|im_end|>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total Emails per Day**:
   - Robyn sends 16 emails in total.

2. **Work Emails**:
   - Seven out of these 16 emails are work-related.
   - Work emails: \(7\)

3. **Remainder After Work Emails**:
   - Remaining emails after work emails = Total emails - Work emails
   - Remains = \(16 - 7 = 9\)

4. **Emails Sent to Family**:
   - Two-thirds of the remaining emails (after excluding work emails) are sent to family.
   - Family emails: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\)

5. **Remaining Emails After Family Emails**:
   - Remaining emails after sending to family = Email to family + Emails not sent to family
   - Not sent to family = \(9 - 6 = 3\)

6. **Emails Sent to Boyfriend**:
   - One-third of the remaining emails (after excluding those sent to family) are sent to her boyfriend.
   - Boyfriend emails: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1\)

So, Robyn sends 1 email daily to her boyfriend.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: {1}.<|im_end|>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.

Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Determine Shawna's age:**
   - We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
   - Aliya's current age is given as 3 years.

2. **Calculate Shawna's age:**
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age}
   \]
   Substituting Aliya's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine Shawna's father's age:**
   - Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
   - Shawna's age is 9 years.

4. **Calculate Shawna's father's age:**
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age}

<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to determine the actual number of attendees based on Kelly's statement.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Courtney reported there were 48 people.
   - Kelly said Courtney overestimated the number by 20%.

2. **Calculate the correct number of attendees based on Kelly’s statement:**
   - If Courtney overestimated by 20%, then the actual number should be 80% (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Actual Number} = \frac{\text{Courtney's Report}}{1 + \text{Overestimation Percentage}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Actual Number} = \frac{48}{1 + 0.2}
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Actual Number} = \frac{48}{1.2}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Actual Number} = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40

6. **Conclusion:**
   The real number of people who attended the concert is 40.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 40.<|im_end|>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.
   - Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.
   - Jason picked up and carried 2 balls.

2. **Calculate the number of balls each person carried:**
   - Since Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball (Jason's share).
   - Therefore, Jordan carried \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) balls (twice Jason's share).

3. **Summarize the total number of balls each person carried:**
   - Jordan: 2 balls
   - Jason: 2 balls
   - Jeffrey: 1 ball

4. **Calculate the total number of balls:**
   - Total balls = Jordan's balls + Jason's balls + Jeffrey's balls
   - Total balls = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Holes Dug Each Day**:
   - First day: 10 holes
   - Second day: 13 holes
   - Third day: 8 holes

2. **Stopping Early on Third Day**:
   - Pirates filled in 2 holes (early stopping).

3. **Fourth Day Digging**:
   - Fourth day: 5 holes dug.

4. **Treasure Found**:
   - Treasure was found on the fourth day.

Now, we need to determine how many holes were dug by the time the treasure was found.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total Holes Before Finding Treasure**:
   - At the start of the first day: \( \text{holes} = 10 \)
   - After filling in 2 holes on the third day: \( \text{holes} = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 \)

2. **Island Holes by Fourth Day**:
   - According to the problem, the number of holes increased by four times compared to the end of the first day.
   - So, if there were 29 holes after filling in 2 on the third day, the total should be \( 29 \times 4 \):
     \[
     29 \times 4 = 116
     \]

Therefore, the pirates dug **116 holes** on the fourth day before finding the treasure.<|im_end|>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

2. **Determine who gets fewer corn chips**:
   - The second group (Amora and Lainey) gets an equal amount.
   - The third group (Collins and someone else) receives 15 more corn chips than the first group.

3. **Calculate the difference in corn chips for the last group**:
   - Let x be the number of corn chips that the last person gets.
   - According to the problem, the last person gets 15 more than the first group.
     Therefore, \(x = 70 + 15\).

4. **Find out how much the last person gets**:

   - Third group (last person): 85.

6. **Add these amounts together**:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon each person has caught based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has.
   - Let \( W \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolde has.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   We know:
   - Alex has 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
     \[
     A = S + 5
     \]
   - Stan has 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolde.
     \[
     S = 4W - 13
     \]

3. **Total Number of Pokémon Caught:**
   The total number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolde is 339.
     \[
     A + S + W = 339
     \]

4. **Substitute Known Values into Equations:**

   Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation for the total number of Pokémon caught.
   
   First, express \( A \) in terms of \( W \):
   \[
   A = (4W - 13) + 5
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   A = 4W - 8
   \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**

   Substitute \( A \) and \( S \) back into the total Pokémon equation:
   \[
   (4W - 8) + (4W - 13) + W = 339
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   9W - 21 = 339
   \]
   Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   9W = 360
   \]
   Divide by 9:
   \[
   W = 40
   \]

6. **Find \( S \) Using \( S = 4W - 13 \):**

   Substitute \( W = 40 \) into the equation for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 4(40) - 13
   \]
   Calculate:
   \[
   S = 160 - 13 = 147
   \]

So, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is:
\[
\boxed{147}

                    question:
                    ; John just : started watching a new show. ,  Each ! episode is 20 minutes : long, and there are half . as : many episodes in total as : there : are minutes per episode.  How many minutes will John spend : watching the ; show ? if he . watches every episode?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of episodes**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of minutes per episode.
   - The length of one episode is given as 20 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total number of episodes based on the total minutes per episode**:
   - Given that the total number of minutes per episode is \( x \), and each episode is 20 minutes long, then the total number of episodes can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Total minutes}}{\text{Length of one episode}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of episodes} = \frac{x}{20}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**:
   - Since John watches all the episodes, the total time spent watching the show would be the total number of episodes multiplied by the length of one episode.
     \[
     \text{Total time (minutes)} = (\text{Total number of episodes}) \times (\text{Length of one episode})
     \]
     Substituting the previously calculated value:
     \[
     \text{Total time (minutes)} = \left(\frac{x}{20}\right) \times 20
     \]
     Simplifying this expression:
     \[
     \text{Total time (minutes)} = x
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We have determined that John spends exactly the same amount of time watching the show as the total number of minutes per episode.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{20}
\]<|im_end|>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.
Since each episode is 20 minutes long, to find the total run time we perform 10*20= <<10*20=200>>200 minutes of run time in total.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance flown by the bird during its journey from the north to the south.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance flown during the first leg:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance flown during the second leg:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance flown during the third leg:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 22 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Sum up all the distances to find the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \( \boxed{446 \text{ miles}} \).<|im_end|>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.
Flying for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour, the bird travels 2*18=<<2*18=36>>36 miles in a northerly direction.
And flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.
Altogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles

<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Batch:**
   - Greta made a batch for herself.
   - The batch consisted of one dozen (12) brownies.

2. **Party at Office:**
   - Her friends threw her a surprise party at work.
   - They gave her half a dozen (6) more brownies.
   
3. **Total Brownies Before Party:**
   - Initial batch + additional brownies = 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.

4. **Eating at Party:**
   - During the party, 1.5 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.
   
5. **Brownies Left After Eating:**
   - Total before party - Eaten during party = 18 - 18 = 0 brownies remaining.

6. **Adding More Brownies Later:**
   - At home, her friends surprised her with an additional dozen (12) brownies.
   
7. **Total Brownies After Addition:**
   - Remaining after eating + Additional brownies = 0 + 12 = 12 brownies.

Therefore, the number of individual brownies that Greta has left over from the entire day is **12**.<|im_end|>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Nani's age:**
   - Nani is given as 8 years old.

2. **Determine Nani's brother's age:**
   - Nani's brother is twice as old as Nani.
   - Brother's age = 2 × Nani's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old.

3. **Calculate the sum of Nani and her brother’s ages:**
   - Sum of their ages = Nani's age + Brother's age = 8 + 16 = 24 years.

4. **Find out how much younger Nani's sister is compared to Nani:**
   - Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani.
   - Let \( S \) be Nani's sister's age.
   - Since she is 25% younger, we can write: \( S = Nani's age - (0.25 \times Nani's age) \)
   - Substituting Nani's age into the equation gives us: \( S = 8 - (0.25 \times 8) \)

5. **Simplify the expression for Nani's sister's age:**
   - Calculate \( 0.25 \times 8 \): \( 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \).
   - So, \( S = 8 - 2 = 6 \).

6. **Sum up the ages of all three family members:**
   - Total age = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age
   - Total age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 years.

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 20 years. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how long it will take Andy to string all his racquets, we'll break down the process into steps based on the given information.

### Step 1: Determine the number of racquets for each type of stringing.
- Synthetic Gut: 3 racquets
- Polyester String: 5 racquets
- Hybrid Set: 4 racquets

### Step 2: Calculate the time required for each type of stringing.
- Synthetic Gut: Each racquet requires 15 minutes. Therefore, for 3 racquets, the total time is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.
- Polyester String: Each racquet requires 22 minutes. Therefore, for 5 racquets, the total time is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.
- Hybrid Sets: Each racquet requires 18 minutes. Therefore, for 4 racquets, the total time is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

### Step 3: Sum up the total time required for all types of stringing.
Total time = Time for synthetic gut + Time for polyester string + Time for hybrid sets
\[
= 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Conclusion:
It will take Andy **227 minutes** to string all his racquets.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To determine the total cost John paid for the phones, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of phones:**
   - John buys phones for himself, his two children, and his wife.
   - Total number of people = 3 (John + 2 kids + wife).

2. **Calculate the number of full-price phones:**
   - Since there are 3 people, only the first phone will be at full price.

3. **Calculate the number of discounted phones:**
   - After buying one full-price phone, John can purchase additional phones that are half price.
   - Number of remaining phones to be bought at full price = \(3 - 1 = 2\).
   - Number of discounted phones = \(5 - 1 = 4\) (since he has already bought one phone).

4. **Calculate the cost per phone based on the given information:**
   - The price of the first phone is $600.
   - All other phones after the first are half price.

5. **Calculate the total cost for the full-price phones:**
   - Full-price phone = $600.
   - Cost of the second full-price phone = $600 * 0.5 = $300.
   - Total cost for the three full-price phones = $600 + $300 = $900.

6. **Calculate the total cost for the discounted phones:**
   - Cost of each discounted phone = $600 / 2 = $300.
   - Number of discounted phones = 4.
   - Total cost for the four discounted phones = $300 * 4 = $1200.

7. **Add up the costs from both types of phones:**
   - Total cost for the phones = Cost of full-price phones + Cost of discounted phones.
     \[
     \$900 + \$1200 = \$2100
     \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the phones is \(\boxed{2100}\).<|im_end|>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of boxes purchased.
Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.

### Step 2: Calculate how many boxes were given to her mom.
She gave some of these boxes to her mom. Since we don't know exactly how many she gave to her mom yet, we'll call that unknown amount \( x \).

So far, she has \( 12 - x \) boxes left for herself.

### Step 3: Calculate how many boxes were given to her sister.
Her sister received 2 boxes.

Now, subtract the boxes given to her mom and sister from the remaining boxes:

\[ (12 - x) - 2 = 10 - x \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many boxes were kept by Mrs. Harrington.
She keeps \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the oranges. So, we need to find out what fraction of the total boxes she keeps.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges is \( 12 \times 20 = 240 \). Therefore, she keeps:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60 \] oranges.

### Step 5: Calculate how many boxes she kept.
If she keeps 60 oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges, then the number of boxes she keeps is:

\[ \frac{60}{20} = 3 \] boxes.

### Step 6: Calculate how many boxes she didn't keep.
Subtracting the boxes she kept from the total boxes she originally had gives us:

\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \] boxes.

### Final Answer:
Mrs. Harrington sold 9 oranges.<|im_end|>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.
She kept 8 x 1/4 = <<8*1/4=2>>2 boxes of oranges.
So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.

                    India has : 4 more than ; half the number ! of states ; in . the USA. What's the total number of states in both countries ; together?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between India and the USA:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of states in the USA.
   - According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.

2. **Express the relationship mathematically:**
   - Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - Therefore, India has \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \) states.

3. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - We know that the number of states in India is equal to \( \frac{x}{2} + 4 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Since we don't have additional information about the exact number of states in either country, we assume there is no further restriction or condition mentioned, so we can proceed without solving for \( x \).

5. **Calculate the total number of states in both countries:**
   - Assume India's state count (based on our understanding):
     - If India has \( y \) states, then \( y = \frac{y}{2} + 4 \).
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{y}{2} + 4 \\
     y - \frac{y}{2} = 4 \\
     \frac{y}{2} = 4 \\
     y = 8
     \]
   - So, India has 8 states.

6. **Summarize the total number of states in both countries:**
   - The USA has \( x \) states, but since we only have one specific example from the problem, we cannot determine \( x \). However, if we assume the USA also follows the same pattern as described, then the USA would also have 8 states (since the problem implies symmetry).

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries would be \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \).

**Final Answer:** The total number of states in both countries is {The final answer is}: 16.<|im_end|>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of all three items**

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur Book: $13
- Children's Cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $40

**Step 2: Determine the amount Tyler still needs**

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance.

Amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved = $40 - $14 = $26

**Step 3: Calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work**

Tyler earns $5 per hour.

Number of hours required = Amount needed / Hourly wage = $26 / $5 = 5.2 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work **5.2 hours** to afford his books.<|im_end|>","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.
Tyler needs $39 and currently has $14, so he needs to earn $39 - $14 = $<<39-14=25>>25.
Tyler can earn $25 at a rate of $5 per hour by doing 25 / $5 = <<25/5=5>>5 hours of work.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherries each person has based on the given information and then find out how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of cherries Richard has:**
   - We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
   
   Let \( R \) represent the number of cherries Richard has.
   Given that \( R + 10 = 30 \), we can solve for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   So, Richard has 20 cherries.

2. **Calculate the total number of cherries left after accounting for Robert’s cherries:**
   - Total cherries = 60
   - Cherries left after Robert's share = 60 - 30 = 30

3. **Determine the number of cherries Jerry has:**
   - Since the remaining cherries (after Robert's share) are shared between Richard and Jerry, let \( J \) represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
   - The sum of cherries for Richard and Jerry should equal the remaining cherries after Robert's share:
     \[
     R + J = 30
     \]
   - We already know \( R = 20 \). Substituting \( R \) into the equation gives us:
     \[
     20 + J = 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 30 - 20 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, Jerry has 10 cherries.

4. **Determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Jerry has 10 cherries.
   - Difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry:
     \[
     30 - 10 = 20
     \]

### Conclusion:
Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.

{The final answer is} 20 cherries.<|im_end|>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Sunny is ! selling gingerbread and apple pie for , a fundraiser. On Saturday, he sold ? 10 , boxes of gingerbread and : 4 fewer : boxes of apple pie, than on ? Sunday. On Sunday, : he sold ; 5 ! more boxes of . gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of ! apple pie. If ! the ; gingerbread ! cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, ; how much did ; Sunny earn for ? two ? days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total earnings from both days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( G_s \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday.
- Let \( A_s \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday.
- Let \( G_u \) be the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday.
- Let \( A_u \) be the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday.

Given information:
- \( G_s = 10 \)
- \( A_s = A_s - 4 \) (Sunday has fewer boxes of apple pie)

### Step 2: Express Apple Pie Boxes Sold on Sunday in Terms of Saturday's Sales
Since the difference between apple pies sold on Saturday and Sunday is given as 15:
\[ A_s - A_u = 15 \]

Substitute \( A_s \):
\[ A_s - (A_s - 4) = 15 \]
\[ A_s - A_s + 4 = 15 \]
\[ 4 = 15 \] (This seems incorrect; let’s correct our approach).

Re-evaluate: The difference should be consistent across Saturdays and Sundays. Given that Gingerbread sales increased by 5 on Sunday compared to Saturday, and since apple pie sales were reduced by 4 on Sunday compared to Saturday, let's directly calculate based on these differences.

### Step 3: Calculate Apple Pie Sales on Sunday
Given the increase in gingerbread sales and decrease in apple pie sales:
- Since Gingerbread sales increased by 5 on Sunday, the same increase applies to apple pie sales.
- Therefore, if Gingerbread sales on Sunday are \( G_u \), then Apple Pie sales on Sunday will be \( A_u = A_s - 4 \).

We know:
\[ G_s = 10 \]
\[ G_u = G_s + 5 \]
\[ G_u = 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Now, solving for \( A_u \):
\[ A_s = 10 \]
\[ A_u = A_s - 4 \]
\[ A_u = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Earnings
Given:
- Cost per box of Gingerbread = $6
- Cost per box of Apple Pie = $15

Total earnings can be calculated as follows:
- Earnings from Gingerbread sales = \( 15 \times 6 \)
- Earnings from Apple Pie sales = \( 6 \times 15 \)

Let's compute these values:
- Earnings from Gingerbread = \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
- Earnings from Apple Pie = \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

Finally, summing up the earnings from both types of sales:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 90 + 90 = 180 \]

### Conclusion
Sunny earned a total of **$180** for two days.<|im_end|>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.
The total number of boxes of gingerbread that Sunny sold is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25.
Sunny earned 25 x $6 = $<<25*6=150>>150 for selling gingerbread.
He sold 15 - 4 = <<15-4=11>>11 boxes of apple pie on Saturday.
The total number of boxes of apple pie that Sunny sold is 15 + 11 = <<15+11=26>>26.
He earned 26 x $15 = $<<26*15=390>>390 for selling apple pie.
So, Sunny earned $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 for two days.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To determine how many 8-ounce bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs for her vacation, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Determine the total time spent outside:**
   - Pamela spends 4 hours outside per day.
   - She plans to stay on vacation for 8 days.
   
   Total time spent outside = \( 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} \)

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen used:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces.
   - Pamela re-applies 1 ounce of sunscreen at any given time.
   
   Let \( T \) represent the total number of hours Pamela spends outside.

3. **Express the total amount of sunscreen used as a function of time:**
   Since Pamela re-applies sunscreen at every hour, the total amount of sunscreen used is equal to the total time spent outside (in hours).

4. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen needed} = T \times \frac{\text{Sunscreen applied per hour}}{\text{Bottle size}}
   \]
   Here, \( T \) is the total time spent outside, which we have already calculated.

5. **Solve for \( T \):**
   \[
   T = 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days}
   \]

6. **Substitute \( T \) into the equation for total sunscreen needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen needed} = 8 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce/hour}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}}
   \]

7. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen needed} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce/hour}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}}
   \]

8. **Final calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen needed} = 4 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \text{ bottles}
   \]

9. **Round up to the nearest whole bottle:**
   Since you can't use half a bottle, round up to the next whole number.

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack **1** bottle of sunscreen for her vacation.<|im_end|>","She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days so that's 4*8 = <<4*8=32>>32 hours

                    The red car is 40% cheaper ; than ; the blue . car. The price of the ! blue car is , $100. How much . do ! both cars cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the prices of both the red and blue cars given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the percentage decrease for the red car:**
   - The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
   - This means the blue car's price is 100% + 40% = 140% (or 150%) of the red car's price.

2. **Calculate the price of the blue car:**
   - Given that the blue car costs $100, which represents 140% of the red car's price.
   - Let \( P_{red} \) be the price of the red car.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     1.4P_{red} = 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( P_{red} \):
     \[
     P_{red} = \frac{100}{1.4}
     \]

3. **Solve for \( P_{red} \):**
   \[
   P_{red} = \frac{100}{1.4} \approx 71.43
   \]

4. **Calculate the price of the red car:**
   - Since the red car is 60% more expensive than the blue car (because it is 40% cheaper), we can calculate its price as follows:
     \[
     P_{red} = P_{blue} \times 1.6
     \]
   - Substituting \( P_{blue} = 100 \):
     \[
     P_{red} = 100 \times 1.6 = 160
     \]

### Conclusion:
Both cars have different prices based on their relationship to each other in terms of cost. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]<|im_end|>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's father and his brother based on the given information.

### Step 1: Determine Emil's age when he turns 24.
Emil currently is 19 years old. We know that at some point in the future (when he turns 24), he will have aged for 5 more years.

\[ \text{Age difference} = 24 - 19 = 5 \]

So, Emil's father must be \(5\) years older than Emil because they will both be 24 years old then.

### Step 2: Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24.
Since Emil will turn 24 after having aged for 5 years, his brother must have been born 5 years ago. Therefore, his brother is currently:

\[ 19 + 5 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

### Step 3: Determine the relationship between Emil's father and Emil's brother.
We are told that when Emil turns 24, his father will be twice as old as his brother. Let’s denote Emil's father's current age as \(F\).

When Emil turns 24, his father will be \(F + 5\) years old, and his brother will be \(24\) years old. According to the problem:

\[ F + 5 = 2 \times 24 \]
\[ F + 5 = 48 \]
\[ F = 48 - 5 \]
\[ F = 43 \]

So, Emil's father is currently 43 years old.

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of their ages.
Now we can find the sum of their ages:

\[ \text{Sum of their ages} = 19 + 43 = 62 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's father and his brother is:

{The final answer is} 62.<|im_end|>","His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.
His brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.
Emil will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = <<24-19=5>>5 years.
The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

To determine how many beads Adrianne has in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of beads given by Adrianne's mother:**
   - Mother gave Adrianne 20 beads.

2. **Calculate the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister:**
   - Sister gave Adrianne 10 more beads than her mother.
   - Number of beads from sister = Mother's beads + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 beads.

3. **Calculate the number of beads given by Adrianne's friend:**
   - Friend gave Adrianne twice as many beads as her mother.
   - Number of beads from friend = 2 × Mother's beads = 2 × 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's sum up all the beads received:
- Beads from mother: 20
- Beads from sister: 30
- Beads from friend: 40

Total beads = 20 (mother) + 30 (sister) + 40 (friend)

Let's add them together:

\[ 
\begin{align*}
\text{Total beads} &= 20 + 30 + 40 \\

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine Joe's total crawfish catch for all three days.
2. Calculate how much Joe catches on Saturday.
3. Convert Joe's Saturday catch into servings based on one serving being 3 pounds.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Day 1: Thursday
Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.

#### Day 2: Friday
On Friday, Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
\[ \text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

#### Day 3: Saturday
On Saturday, Joe caught half the amount he caught on Friday.
\[ \text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's sum up Joe's total crawfish catch over the three days:
\[ \text{Total catch} = 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} \]
\[ \text{Total catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

#### Converting to servings:
Since 1 serving contains 3 pounds of crawfish, we can find out how many servings Joe has by dividing the total weight of crawfish by the weight per serving.
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{Weight per serving}} \]
\[ \text{Number of servings} = \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds/serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, Joe has **7 servings** of crawfish.<|im_end|>","He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds
On Saturday, he caught half the amount of the 12 pounds he caught on Friday so he caught 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pounds
In three days he has caught 3+12+6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish
3 pounds is a serving and he caught 21 pounds so he has 21/3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many students are leaving early, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of football players:**
   - Total students = 30
   - Percentage of football players = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of football players} = 30 \times 0.20 = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining students after accounting for football players:**
   - Remaining students = Total students - Football players
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 30 - 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who are either cheerleaders or in the band:**
   - Percentage of these students = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of cheerleaders or band members} = 24 \times 0.25 = 6
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of football players from the remaining students to find those left:**
   - Students still present = Remaining students - Cheerleaders or band members
   \[
   \text{Students still present} = 24 - 6 = 18
   \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early to travel to an away game is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]<|im_end|>","20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Sophie's boot size is 5.
   - Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's.

2. **Calculate Charlie's boot size:**
   - Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we multiply Sophie's boot size (which is 5) by 5.
   \[
   \text{Charlie's boot size} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of boots:**
   - The problem states there are five boots in total for both Sophie and Charlie.

4. **Find the combined average boot size:**
   - To find the average size of the shoes worn by both, we need to add the sizes together and then divide by the number of people.
   - Let \( S \) be Sophie's boot size and \( C \) be Charlie's boot size.
   \[
   S + C = 5 + 25 = 30
   \]
   - There are two people (Sophie and Charlie), so we divide the total sum by 2.
   \[
   \text{Average size} = \frac{S + C}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average size of the shoes worn by the two people is 15.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total length of the flower bed:**
   - The flower bed is 111 feet long.

2. **Determine the number of gaps needed between the plants:**
   - Since there needs to be 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to divide the total length of the flower bed by this gap.
   \[
   \text{Number of gaps} = \frac{\text{Length of the flower bed}}{\text{Gap width}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{1.5 \text{ feet/gap}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of gaps} = 74
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of plants required:**
   - Each gap represents one plant plus one additional space (the gap itself), meaning there are two spaces per plant.
   \[
   \text{Total number of plants} = \frac{\text{Number of gaps}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of plants} = \frac{74}{2} = 37
   \]

4. **Verify the total number of plants matches the given information:**
   - We're told Pat already owns 17 flowers, but this doesn't affect our calculation for filling the entire bed. This might indicate an error in the provided data or information about ownership.

5. **Calculate the cost of the plants:**
   - Each plant costs $6.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total number of plants} \times \text{Cost per plant}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 37 \times 6 = \$222
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend on filling up her flower bed is $\boxed{222}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for sunflowers**
- Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil.
- They are planting 4 sunflowers.

\[
\text{Total soil for sunflowers} = 4 \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for carnations**
- Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil.
- They are planting 10 carnations.

\[
\text{Total soil for carnations} = 10 \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings:**
   - Jessica saves 25% of her monthly income.
   - Her monthly income is $2,000.00.

\[
\text{Monthly Savings} = \text{Monthly Income} \times \frac{\text{Savings Percentage}}{100}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to both peel and cook 90 shrimp. Let's break down the process into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the time for peeling 90 shrimp
Emily can peel 6 shrimp in one minute.

- Time to peel 1 shrimp = \( \frac{1}{6} \) minute
- Time to peel 90 shrimp = \( 90 \times \frac{1}{6} \) minutes = \( 15 \) minutes

### Step 2: Determine the time for cooking 90 shrimp
Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

- Time to sauté 1 shrimp = \( \frac{1}{30} \) minute
- Time to sauté 90 shrimp = \( 90 \times \frac{1}{30} \) minutes = \( 3 \) minutes

### Step 3: Add the times together
Total time required = Time to peel + Time to sauté

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes (peeling)} + 3 \text{ minutes (sausageing)} = 18 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take Emily **18 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.<|im_end|>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cooling effect per hour:**
   - On low setting, the AC cools the room at 2 °C/hour.
   - On high setting, the AC cools the room at 3 °C/hour.

2. **Calculate the total cooling time in each mode:**
   - For the first 3 hours on low setting:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ °C/hour} = 6 \text{ °C}
     \]
   - For the next 4 hours on high setting:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ °C/hour} = 12 \text{ °C}
     \]

3. **Sum the total cooling effects:**
   - Total cooling over all times:
     \[
     6 \text{ °C} + 12 \text{ °C} = 18 \text{ °C}
     \]

4. **Determine the initial temperature difference:**
   - Let \( T_0 \) be the initial temperature of the room (before any cooling).
   - Since the room warms up by 2 °C/hour without the AC, we can express the final temperature as:
     \[
     T_f = T_0 + 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ °C/hour} = T_0 + 4 \text{ °C}
     \]

5. **Subtract the total cooling from the final temperature:**
   - Final temperature after cooling:
     \[
     T_f = T_0 + 4 \text{ °C}
     \]
   - Temperature reduction due to cooling:
     \[
     T_f' = T_0 + 4 \text{ °C} - 18 \text{ °C} = T_0 - 14 \text{ °C}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The final temperature is \( 14 \) °C lower than the starting temperature.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Comet Halley ! orbits the , sun , every , 75 years. Bill's ; dad saw the Comet ? when he was 30 years old. . Bill . saw the comet . a second time when he was three times the age his ? father was ? when , he ? saw the ? Comet. How old was : Bill when he saw the Comet for the . first time?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationship between ages:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet again at some point in the future.

2. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of years after Bill's father saw the comet that Bill saw it the second time.
   - Let \( b \) be the age Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

3. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - The total time from Bill's father seeing the comet until he saw it again is \( (b + x) \) years.
   - According to the problem, this time is 75 years because comets orbit around the Sun every 75 years.

4. **Express the total time as an equation:**
   \[
   b + x = 75
   \]

5. **Relate the ages:**
   - We know that Bill's father was 30 years old when Bill saw the comet the first time.
   - When Bill saw the comet the second time, he was three times older than his father was when he first saw the comet.

6. **Formulate the second part of the equation:**
   - Since Bill was \( b \) years old when he saw the comet the first time, his father was \( b \) years old then.
   - Therefore, when Bill saw the comet the second time, his father was \( 3b \) years old.

7. **Use the relationship between their ages:**
   - The difference in their ages must equal the total time since the first sighting.
   \[
   b - (b - 30) = b - (b - 30) = 30
   \]
   This means \( b - 30 \) years equals the time interval between the two sightings.

8. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From the equation \( b + x = 75 \), we have \( x = 75 - b \).
   - Substitute \( x \) into the age relationship:
     \[
     b - (b - 30) = 30
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     b - b + 30 = 30
     \]
     \[
     30 = 30
     \]
   - This confirms our setup is correct.

9. **Find \( b \):**
   - Solve for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 30
     \]

Therefore, Bill was 30 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. The final answer is {The final answer is} 30.<|im_end|>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, let's break down his monthly contributions:

1. **Electric Bill**:
   - Buford writes one check per month to pay the electric bill.
   
2. **Gas Bill**:
   - Buford writes another check per month to pay the gas bill.

3. **Church Contributions**:
   - Buford writes two checks per month to contribute to the church.

4. **Pest & Lawn Service**:
   - Buford writes four checks per quarter (since there are three months in a quarter), which means he writes twice per month for these services.

Now, let's calculate the total number of checks written per month:
- Electric bill: 1 check/month
- Gas bill: 1 check/month
- Church: 2 checks/month
- Pest & Lawn Service: 2 checks/month

Total per month = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 checks/month

Next, we need to find out how many checks Buford writes per year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

Total per year = Total per month * Months per year
                = 6 checks/month * 12 months/year
                = 72 checks/year

Therefore, Buford writes 72 checks per year. The final answer is:
{The final answer is} 72 checks per year.<|im_end|>","Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.
He also writes a check every month for the gas bill, or 1*12-12 checks each year.
Twice per month he writes a check to the church, or 2*12-24 checks each year.
Quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service, or 1*4=<<1*4=4>>4 checks each year.
In total, Buford writes 12+12+24+4=<<12+12+24+4=52>>52 checks per year.

                    question:
                    An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times . a day. , Each day, the first plane , goes . to ?

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine total daily flights:**
   - Total trips per day = 44 (as given)

2. **Calculate flights to France from the first plane:**
   - First plane splits its remaining flights between France and Germany.
   - Since the second plane also flies to France but only 50% as much as the first plane, let’s denote:
     - \( F \) = flights to France
     - \( G \) = flights to Germany
   
   According to the problem, the first plane flies to France for two-thirds of its flights. This means:
   \[
   \frac{F}{G} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

3. **Express flights to France in terms of total flights:**
   - Let the total flights be \( T \).
   - The first plane flies to France for \(\frac{3}{5}\) of these flights because it doesn’t fly to France at all.

4. **Relate flights to France to flights to Poland:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, which is exactly half of the first plane’s total flights:
     \[
     P = \frac{T}{2}
     \]
   
   We know that the first plane makes more flights than the second plane:
   \[
   T > P
   \]

5. **Solve the equation involving fractions:**
   Given:
   \[
   \frac{F}{G} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Let’s express \( F \) in terms of \( T \):
   \[
   F = \frac{3}{5}T
   \]
   Since \( F + G = T \), substitute \( F \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{5}T + G = T
   \]
   Solving for \( G \):
   \[
   G = T - \frac{3}{5}T = \frac{2}{5}T
   \]

6. **Use the relationship between \( F \) and \( G \):**
   \[
   \frac{F}{G} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Substitute \( F \) and \( G \):
   \[
   \frac{\frac{3}{5}T}{\frac{2}{5}T} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Verify:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

7. **Find the value of \( T \):**
   Since the total flights per day equals 44:
   \[
   T = 44
   \]

8. **Calculate flights to France:**
   \[
   F = \frac{3}{5}T = \frac{3}{5} \times 44 = 26.4
   \]

9. **Round up to nearest whole number:**
   As the number of flights must be an integer, we round up:
   \[
   F = 27
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The first plane takes 27 flights to France in one day.<|im_end|>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl and then find the combined length of all their howls.

1. **Determine the length of each wolf’s howl:**
   - Tobias’ howl lasts for \(20\) seconds.
   
2. **Calculate Chikote's howl duration based on Tobias' howl duration:**
   - Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias,
     \[
     \text{Chikote's howl} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   
3. **Calculate Igneous' howl duration based on the combined howl durations of Tobias and Chikote:**
   - The combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote is:
     \[
     20 \text{ seconds (Tobias)} + 40 \text{ seconds (Chikote)} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Igneous' howl must last for half of that combined duration because he hoots for as long as both others combined.
     \[
     \text{Igneous' howl} = \frac{60}{2} \text{ seconds} = 30 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total howling time:**
   - Tobias: \(20\) seconds
   - Chikote: \(40\) seconds
   - Igneous: \(30\) seconds
   \[
   \text{Total howling time} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 30 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert the total howling time from seconds to minutes:**
   \[
   \text{Total howling time in minutes} = \frac{90 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = 1.5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Conclusion:**
\[
\boxed{1.5 \text{ minutes}}
\]<|im_end|>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total amount Adam spent on trousers:**
   - Adam spent $30 on trousers.

2. **Determine how much Adam received from his mother:**
   - Adam's mother gave him $6.

3. **Calculate how much Adam received from his father:**
   - Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother.
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Add up all the amounts received:**
   - From his mother: $6
   - From his father: $12
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18
   \]

5. **Subtract the cost of the trousers from the total amount received:**
   \[
   18 - 30 = -12
   \]
   This result indicates that Adam would still owe money after considering the cost of the trousers. However, since he already had some money (from his mother), we need to adjust our approach.

6. **Correctly account for the initial situation where Adam had some money from his mother:**
   - Let's assume Adam initially had $X from his mother.
   - After spending $30 on trousers, he should have $X left.
   - His father then gives him twice as much ($12), so now he has:
     \[
     X + 12
     \]
   - He spends another $30 on trousers, so he should be left with:
     \[
     (X + 12) - 30 = X - 18
     \]

7. **Since the net balance must equal zero (he owes nothing in principle), we can set up an equation:**
   \[
   X - 18 = 0
   \]
   Solving for \(X\):
   \[
   X = 18
   \]

Therefore, Adam originally had $18 saved before buying the trousers. Since he used $30 to buy them, he effectively contributed $18 towards his savings. 

**Final Answer:** Adam had to contribute $18 from his savings.<|im_end|>","Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( A \) be Akbar's age, \( H \) be Helene's age, \( W \) be Wilfred's age, and \( L \) be Alessandro's age. We know that \( L = 4 \).

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We are given two pieces of information:
1. Helene's age is twice the average age of the group.
2. The total age of all four children is 20.

First, we find the average age of the group. Since there are four children:

\[ \text{Average Age} = \frac{A + H + L + W}{4} \]

Given that \( L = 4 \), substitute \( L \) into the equation:

\[ \text{Average Age} = \frac{A + H + 4 + W}{4} \]

According to the second piece of information, the average age is also equal to \( \frac{L}{4} \):

\[ \frac{L}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]

So, the average age of the group is 1 year.

### Step 3: Equation for Average Age
Now we can set up an equation using the average age:

\[ \frac{A + H + 4 + W}{4} = 1 \]

Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:

\[ A + H + 4 + W = 4 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides to simplify:

\[ A + H + W = 0 \]

Since ages cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our approach or assumptions. Let's consider the possibility that one child might have died or was removed from the group, but since they are still playing together, let’s assume no deaths occurred.

### Step 4: Calculate Ages
From the information provided, we know:
- Akbar is 3 years old (\( A = 3 \))
- Alessandro is 4 years old (\( L = 4 \))

Substitute these values back into the simplified equation:

\[ 3 + H + W = 0 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ H + W = -3 \]

Since ages must be positive, this indicates an error in the initial setup. Let's reassess the problem.

### Correct Approach
Revising our understanding, if Helene is twice the average age, then her age should be twice the average age:

\[ H = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Thus, the correct calculation would be:

\[ A + H + 4 + W = 4 \]
\[ 3 + 2 + 4 + W = 4 \]
\[ 9 + W = 4 \]
\[ W = 4 - 9 \]
\[ W = -5 \]

This again suggests an error in our initial assumptions. Given the constraints and logical steps, the only consistent solution under normal circumstances (no anomalies like death or removal) does not yield a valid non-negative age for Wilfred.

Therefore, upon re-evaluation, the most likely scenario is an error in the problem statement or data, leading to no feasible solution within the given parameters.

### Conclusion
Given the current constraints and logic, there is no valid age for Wilfred based on the provided information and reasonable interpretations. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{No valid age}}
\]<|im_end|>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Walter starts with $500 from his neighbors.

Next, he adds $1500 from an online fundraising fund.

So far, the total collected is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the contribution from the lawyer**

According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times what others have donated.

First, we need to find out how many people other than the lawyer contributed to the initial collection (excluding himself).

Since Walter has already collected $2000 and his friend gave him an additional $200, there were two contributions so far.

Let \( x \) be the total amount that the lawyer contributes.

From Step 1, we know the total amount before the lawyer's donation was $2000. Since the lawyer's contribution is three times this amount, we can write:
\[ x = 3 \times 2000 \]
\[ x = 6000 \]

Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:
\[ The final answer is: 6000 \]<|im_end|>","Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.

                    question:
                    : A ? family of 6 (2 adults and 4 ? kids) ? are to : divide a : watermelon such that each adult gets a slice ! that is twice as big as that of each : kid. What , percentage of . the watermelon does each : adult . get?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the fraction of the watermelon that one kid receives.
   Since each adult's slice is twice as large, an adult will receive \( 2x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total volume of the watermelon must equal the sum of the volumes of all slices for both adults and children. Given there are 2 adults and 4 kids, we can write:

\[ 2(2x) + 4(x) = 1 \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplify the equation to find \( x \):

\[ 4x + 4x = 1 \]
\[ 8x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{8} \]

4. **Determine the Volume Each Adult Gets:**
   Now that we know \( x \), calculate the volume each adult gets:

\[ \text{Volume per adult} = 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \]

5. **Calculate the Percentage:**
   To express the volume received by each adult as a percentage of the whole watermelon, use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Volume per adult}}{\text{Total volume}}\right) \times 100 \]

Substitute in the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1}\right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 25\% \]

### Final Answer:
Each adult gets \( 25\% \) of the watermelon.<|im_end|>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Time Spent at Clinic**:
   - Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic.

2. **Time spent on Inpatient Rounds**:
   - Each round (for an inpatient) takes 20 minutes.
   - There are 10 inpatients.
   - Total time spent on inpatient rounds = 10 * 20 = 200 minutes.

3. **Time spent on Appointments**:
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - There are 10 appointments.
   - Total time spent on appointments = 10 * 30 = 300 minutes.

4. **Calculate Total Time Spent at Clinic**:
   - Sum of time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments: 
     200 + 300 = 500 minutes.

5. **Convert Total Time Spent at Clinic into Hours**:
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
     500 minutes / 60 = 8.33 hours.

6. **Determine Remaining Time**:
   - Doctor Jones starts with 9 hours.
   - Subtract the total time spent at the clinic from his starting time:
     9 hours - 8.33 hours = 0.67 hours remaining.

Therefore, Doctor Jones will have **0.67 hours** left to update his records after completing his work schedule. The final answer is {The final answer is} 0.67 hours.<|im_end|>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the total time required for baking and frosting the cake:

1. **Baking Time**: 
   - Total time to bake = 30 minutes.

2. **Cooling Time**:
   - Total cooling time = 2 hours (which is 120 minutes).

3. **Frosting Time**:
   - Total frosting time = 10 minutes.

Now, add these times together:
- Baking + Cooling + Frosting = 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 160 minutes.

4. Convert the total time into hours since we need to find the latest possible starting time:
   - 160 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2.67 hours.

Since Jordan wants to have the cake ready at 5:00 PM, we need to subtract the total time from 5:00 PM.
- Start time = 5:00 PM - 2.67 hours.

Calculating 2.67 hours backwards from 5:00 PM:
- Subtract 2 hours: 5:00 PM - 2 hours = 3:00 PM.
- Subtract the remaining 0.67 hours (since 2.67 hours - 2 hours = 0.67 hours): 3:00 PM - 0.67 hours ≈ 2:59 PM.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan should start making the cake to ensure it is ready by 5:00 PM is approximately **2:59 PM**.<|im_end|>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in one box based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - Lisa sold 3.5 + (unknown number) = 64 chocolate bars.
   - Peter sold 4.5 + (unknown number) = 64 chocolate bars.

2. **Combine the equations for both Lisa and Peter's sales:**
   \[
   3.5 + x_1 + 4.5 + x_2 = 64
   \]
   where \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) represent the unknown numbers of chocolate bars per box that Lisa and Peter sold respectively.

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   8 + x_1 + x_2 = 64
   \]

4. **Isolate the sum of unknowns:**
   \[
   x_1 + x_2 = 64 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x_1 + x_2 = 56
   \]

5. **Determine the value of \(x\):**
   Since we don't have additional information about \(x_1\) or \(x_2\), we assume they sell an equal number of chocolate bars per box for simplicity. Therefore:
   \[
   x_1 = x_2 = \frac{56}{2} = 28
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \text{There are } 28 \text{ chocolate bars in a box.} \]<|im_end|>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of sessions per day
- The dance studio rents for 3 days a week.
- Each day they offer lessons to 10 students.
  
\[
\text{Total sessions per day} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ sessions}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sessions per week
- There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Total sessions per week} = 30 \times 7 = 210 \text{ sessions}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per session
- Cost per session at the studio includes $25 (studio rental) + $1.50 (per student).

\[
\text{Cost per session} = \$25 + \$1.50 = \$26.50
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the weekly revenue from one session
- Number of students per session = 10.
- Revenue from one session = \( 10 \times \$26.50 \)

\[
\text{Revenue per session} = \$265
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the monthly revenue
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

\[
\text{Monthly sessions} = 210 \times 4 = 840 \text{ sessions}
\]
- Monthly revenue = \( 840 \times \$265 \)

\[
\text{Monthly revenue} = \$226,700
\]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is **\$226,700**.<|im_end|>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes.
     \[
     4x = 64
     \]
   - Martha has 7 boxes.
     \[
     7x = 56
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   For Peter's equation:
   \[
   4x = 64 \implies x = \frac{64}{4} = 16
   \]
   For Martha's equation:
   \[
   7x = 56 \implies x = \frac{56}{7} = 8
   \]

   There seems to be an inconsistency because \( x \) should be the same for both Peter and Martha. However, since the problem states that they have the ""same number"" of chocolate bars per box, we can conclude that \( x \) must be consistent between them. Therefore, let's assume there was a misinterpretation or typo, but for the sake of solving the given problem:

4. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**
   Since the problem statement indicates that Peter and Martha have different numbers of boxes but the same number of chocolate bars per box, it implies a mistake in the setup. Let's correct the approach based on the given information.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - If Peter has 4 boxes and 64 chocolate bars total, then:
     \[
     4x = 64 \implies x = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - If Martha has 7 boxes and 56 chocolate bars total, then:
     \[
     7x = 56 \implies x = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]

   This again shows inconsistency due to the original assumption. Assuming the problem meant to say the same number of chocolate bars per box:

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - Peter's chocolate bars:
     \[
     4 \times 16 = 64
     \]
   - Martha's chocolate bars:
     \[
     7 \times 8 = 56
     \]

   Therefore, Peter has \( 64 - 56 = 8 \) more chocolate bars than Martha.

**Conclusion:**
Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box compared to Martha.<|im_end|>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines:**
   - Total population = 50
   - Female porcupines make up \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.
   - Number of females = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 50 \)
     \[
     \text{Number of females} = \frac{3 \times 50}{5} = \frac{150}{5} = 30

2. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born per month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies per month.
   - Monthly births per female = 4
   - Number of females = 30
   - Monthly births = \( 4 \times 30 \)
     \[
     \text{Monthly births} = 120

3. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born over one year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total yearly births = \( 120 \times 12 \)
     \[
     \text{Total yearly births} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
     \]

4. **Add the initial population to the annual births:**
   - Initial population = 50
   - Annual births = 1440
   - Final population = Initial population + Annual births
     \[
     \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps required:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool
First, we need to determine the volume of the pool in cubic feet.

- Width (W) = 14 feet
- Length (L) = 25 feet
- Depth (D) = 4 feet

The formula to calculate the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of a swimming pool) is:
\[ V = W \times L \times D \]

Substitute the given dimensions into the equation:
\[ V = 14 \text{ ft} \times 25 \text{ ft} \times 4 \text{ ft} \]
\[ V = 14 \times 25 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 350 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 2: Convert Cubic Feet to Gallons
Next, convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. We know that there are approximately 7.48052 gallons in one cubic foot.

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{\text{Volume in cubic feet}}{7.48052} \]

Substitute the calculated volume in cubic feet:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{1400}{7.48052} \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} \approx 186.61 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost to Fill the Pool
Now, we need to calculate the total cost based on the number of gallons needed.

Given:
- Cost per gallon = $0.10

Total cost = Volume in gallons × Cost per gallon

Substitute the volume in gallons and the cost per gallon:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 186.61 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.10/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 18.661 \]

### Final Answer:
It will cost approximately **$18.66** to fill the pool.<|im_end|>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sticks in the game. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of red sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.

2. **Calculate the number of blue sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11
     \]

4. **Sum up all the sticks:**
   - Red sticks: 9
   - Blue sticks: 14
   - Yellow sticks: 11
     \[
     \text{Total number of sticks} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

                    question:
                    Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour : for 4 , hours. Shandy traveled at 45 . miles per ? hour ; for 10 hours. How many miles farther did . Shandy . drive , than Matteo?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many miles farther Shandy traveled compared to Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled using their respective speeds and times.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by Matteo**

- Speed of Matteo = 55 miles per hour
- Time traveled by Matteo = 4 hours

Distance (D) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the values for Matteo:
\[ D_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ D_{\text{Matteo}} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by Shandy**

- Speed of Shandy = unknown (let's call it \( S \)) miles per hour
- Time traveled by Shandy = 10 hours

We know that both distances must be equal since they traveled the same total distance:

\[ D_{\text{Shandy}} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Using the same distance formula:
\[ D_{\text{Shandy}} = S \times 10 \, \text{hours} \]

Since \( D_{\text{Shandy}} = 220 \, \text{miles}\), we can set up the equation:
\[ S \times 10 = 220 \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{220}{10} \]
\[ S = 22 \, \text{miles/hour} \]

So, Shandy traveled at 22 miles per hour.

**Step 3: Determine how much farther Shandy traveled**

To find out how much farther Shandy traveled, subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = D_{\text{Shandy}} - D_{\text{Matteo}} \]
\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = 220 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = 0 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy traveled the same distance as Matteo. There was no difference in the number of miles they drove.

The final answer is: The final answer is 0.<|im_end|>","Matteo = 55 * 4 = <<55*4=220>>220 miles

Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of students over 16 years old:**
   - Total students = 3000
   - Half of these students are over 16 years old.
     \[
     \text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of male students among those over 16 years old:**
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
     \[
     \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]

3. **Find the number of female students among those over 16 years old:**
   - Subtract the number of male students from the total students over 16.
     \[
     \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
     \]

4. **Determine the number of students under 16 years old:**
   - Remaining students after excluding those over 16.
     \[
     \text{Students under 16} = 3000 - 1500 = 1500
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of male students among those under 16 years old:**
   - One-half of the students under 16 are male.
     \[
     \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750

6. **Find the number of female students among those under 16 years old:**
   - Subtract the number of male students from the total students under 16.
     \[
     \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
     \]

7. **Total number of female students in the school:**
   - Sum of female students over 16 and under 16.
     \[
     \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875

To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of laps each person runs.
2. Find the difference between Bethany's laps and Quinn's laps.

Let's break this down:

### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Laps Each Person Runs

- **Bethany**: She can run 10 laps in an hour.
  
- **Trey**:
  - Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
  - Therefore, Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.

- **Shaelyn**:
  - Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
  - Therefore, Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.

- **Quinn**:
  - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
  - Therefore, Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

### Step 2: Determine the Difference Between Bethany's and Quinn's Laps

Now, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Difference} = 10 - 5 = 5
\]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 5}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total work done on the first day:**
   - Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank.
   - Ms. B pumps 3/4 of what Wanda pumped.

   Let \( W \) represent the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day.
   
   Therefore, the amount of water Ms. B pumped would be:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}W
   \]

   The total amount of water pumped on the first day is:
   \[
   W + \frac{3}{4}W = \frac{7}{4}W
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water left after the first day:**
   - The initial volume of water in the tank is 18000 gallons.
   - After the first day, the tank will have:
     \[
     18000 - \frac{7}{4}W
     \]
     
3. **Calculate the work done on the second day:**
   - Wanda pumps 2/3 of what she did on the first day.
   - Ms. B pumps 1/3 of what she did on the first day.

   Since Wanda pumped \( W \) on the first day, her second-day contribution would be:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}W
   \]

   And since Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4}W \) on the first day, her second-day contribution would be:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{3}{4}W\right) = \frac{1}{4}W
   \]

   The total amount of water pumped on the second day is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}W + \frac{1}{4}W
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water left after the second day:**
   - After the second day, the tank will have:
     \[
     \left(18000 - \frac{7}{4}W\right) - \left(\frac{2}{3}W + \frac{1}{4}W\right)
     \]

5. **Simplify the expression for the second-day pumping:**
   - Find a common denominator (which is 12) to combine fractions:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}W = \frac{8}{12}W, \quad \frac{1}{4}W = \frac{3}{12}W
     \]
     \[
     \frac{8}{12}W + \frac{3}{12}W = \frac{11}{12}W
     \]

6. **Substitute back into the equation:**
   \[
   \left(18000 - \frac{7}{4}W\right) - \frac{11}{12}W
   \]

7. **Combine like terms:**
   - Convert 18000 to a fraction with a denominator of 12:
     \[
     18000 = \frac{216000}{12}
     \]
   - Substitute:
     \[
     \left(\frac{216000}{12} - \frac{7}{4}W\right) - \frac{11}{12}W
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{216000}{12} - \left(\frac{7}{4}W + \frac{11}{12}W\right)
     \]
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{7}{4}W = \frac{21}{12}W
     \]
     \[
     \frac{21}{12}W + \frac{11}{12}W = \frac{32}{12}W = \frac{8}{3}W
     \]

8. **Final calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{216000}{12} - \frac{8}{3}W
   \]
   - Subtract the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{216000}{12} - \frac{8}{3}W = \frac{216000}{12} - \frac{32}{12}W
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information provided about the power bank's charge loss over time. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the initial charge level**:
   - The final charge left after 5 hours (when her friends were asking) is 28%.

2. **Calculate the charge remaining after each hour of loss**:
   - After the first hour, the charge would be \( 28\% \times (1 + 0.09) = 28\% \times 1.09 = 3.172\% \).
   - After the second hour, the charge would be \( 3.172\% \times (1 + 0.09) = 3.172\% \times 1.09 = 3.46188\% \).

3. **Continue calculating until you reach the point where the charge starts decreasing**:
   - For the next 3 hours, the charge decreases by 7% per hour.
     - After the third hour, the charge would be \( 3.46188\% \times (1 - 0.07) = 3.46188\% \times 0.93 = 3.2066464\% \).
     - After the fourth hour, the charge would be \( 3.2066464\% \times (1 - 0.07) = 3.2066464\% \times 0.93 = 2.979546816\% \).
     - After the fifth hour, the charge would be \( 2.979546816\% \times (1 - 0.07) = 2.979546816\% \times 0.93 = 2.731962484\% \).

4. **Finalize the calculation**:
   - We can see that the charge continues to decrease in the same manner until it reaches zero.

Therefore, the charge remaining when Maria went out to the park was approximately 2.73%, which rounds to 2.7%.

Hence, the final answer is: The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 2.7%.<|im_end|>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Janet's total weekly earnings.
Janet earns two types of pay:
- Hourly wage: $10 per hour
- Tips: $15 per hour

First, calculate her total earnings from these hourly rates in one week.

\[ \text{Total Weekly Earnings} = (\$10 + \$15) \times 40 \]

Let's compute this sum first:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \]
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]

So, Janet earns $1000 per week from both her hourly wage and tips combined.

### Step 2: Determine the amount of money Janet needs to save.
She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car as a down payment.

\[ \text{Down Payment Amount} = 0.20 \times 10000 \]

Now, let's calculate the down payment:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \]

So, Janet needs to save $2000.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks required to reach her goal.
We know that Janet saves $1000 per week. To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total savings needed by her weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Number of Weeks Needed} = \frac{\$2000}{\$1000/\text{week}} \]

Let's perform the division:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \]

Therefore, Janet needs to work for **2** weeks to save enough for her down payment.<|im_end|>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

Including tax, ? peaches and pears are $.5 ; each, . apples . are $.75 each, kiwis are , $1, and plums cost $.25 each. If he has already purchased 3 peaches, ? 4 pears, , 2 kiwis, and ! 5 apples, how . many plums can he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on fruits already bought.
- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = \(3 \times 0.5 = \$1.5\)
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = \(4 \times 0.5 = \$2\)
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1 each = \(2 \times 1 = \$2\)

Total spent on fruits so far: 
\[ \$1.5 + \$2 + \$2 = \$5.5 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the total spent on fruits from his initial budget.
Jamaar initially had $10.

Remaining money after buying fruits:
\[ \$10 - \$5.5 = \$4.5 \]

### Step 3: Determine the price per plum.
Plums cost $0.25 each.

### Step 4: Calculate how many plums he can afford with the remaining money.
Number of plums he can buy:
\[ \frac{\$4.5}{\$0.25} = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of plums he can buy is **18**.<|im_end|>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5
He has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2
He has spent $3.75 on apples because 5 x .75 = <<5*.75=3.75>>3.75
He has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25
He can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3

                    question:
                    Anne purchased : a , box ; of sweets that . contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. , She , kept two packs and gave the rest , to ! her ; 10 friends equally. How many pieces of sweets did each ; of ! her ? friends receive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of packs in the box.
Anne bought one box containing 15 packs.

### Step 2: Determine how many packs she keeps for herself.
She keeps 2 packs.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of packs remaining after she takes out the 2 packs.
Total packs - Packs kept = 15 - 2 = 13 packs left.

### Step 4: Divide the remaining packs among her 10 friends.
Each friend receives an equal share of the remaining packs.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of pieces per friend.
First, find the total number of pieces from all 13 packs.
\[ \text{Total pieces} = \text{Packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} \]
\[ \text{Total pieces} = 13 \times 60 \]

### Step 6: Perform the multiplication.
\[ \text{Total pieces} = 13 \times 60 = 780 \]

### Step 7: Distribute these pieces equally among the 10 friends.
Now divide the total number of pieces by 10 to find out how many each friend gets.
\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Number of friends}} \]
\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{780}{10} \]

### Step 8: Simplify the division.
\[ \text{Pieces per friend} = 78 \]

Therefore, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]<|im_end|>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

(Round ; to the , nearest integer)
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the price increase for each year.

- **Initial Price**: $120.
  
- **First Year Increase**:
  - The price increases by 5%. 
  - To find the new price, multiply the initial price by \(1 + \frac{5}{100}\) or equivalently \(1.05\).
  - New price after first year = \(120 \times 1.05\).

- **Second Year Increase**:
  - Again, the price increases by 5%.
  - To find the new price, multiply the current price by \(1 + \frac{5}{100}\) or \(1.05\).
  - New price after second year = previous year's price \(\times 1.05\).

- **Third Year Increase**:
  - Once more, the price increases by 5%.
  - To find the new price, multiply the current price by \(1 + \frac{5}{100}\) or \(1.05\).
  - New price after third year = previous year's price \(\times 1.05^2\) (since there are two increases in total over the course of three years).

### Step 2: Perform the calculations.

#### First Year Calculation:
\[ 120 \times 1.05 = 126 \]

#### Second Year Calculation:
\[ 126 \times 1.05 = 132.3 \]

#### Third Year Calculation:
\[ 132.3 \times 1.05 = 140.715 \]

### Step 3: Round the final result to the nearest integer.

The price of carrots after three years will be approximately $141 when rounded to the nearest integer.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{141}$.<|im_end|>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Pictures Uploaded:**
   Olivia uploaded 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums:**
   Olivia put the same number of pictures in 8 albums.

3. **Pictures per Album:**
   To find out how many pictures are in one album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

4. **Selfies Only Albums:**
   Out of the 8 albums, 3 albums contain only selfies. Therefore, the remaining albums must contain both selfies and other types of pictures.

5. **Calculating Selfie Albums:**
   Since there are 3 selfie-only albums, the remaining albums will be non-selfie.
   \[
   \text{Non-selfie albums} = 8 - 3 = 5
   \]

6. **Portraits Albums:**
   We know that 2 albums are portraits. 

7. **Total Number of Albums:**
   The total number of albums is given as 8.

8. **Calculating Total Portraits and Selfies:**
   Let \( P \) represent the total number of portraits, and \( S \) represent the total number of selfies. We know that:
   \[
   P + S = 72
   \]
   And we also know:
   \[
   P = \text{total portraits}
   \]
   \[
   S = \text{total selfies}
   \]

9. **Portraits Calculation:**
   Given that 2 albums are portraits, these are included in the total portraits count.
   So, the total number of portraits can be calculated as:
   \[
   P = \text{portraits from all albums} + \text{portraits only in some albums}
   \]
   Since we don't know exactly how many portraits are in those 2 specific albums, we need to consider them together with the rest of the albums.

10. **Selfies Calculation:**
    Similarly, since 3 albums are selfie-only, they contribute to the selfies count.
    So, the total number of selfies can be calculated as:
    \[
    S = \text{selfies only} + \text{selfies in other albums}
    \]

Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact numbers without additional details about the distribution of portraits among the different albums. However, if we assume that the distribution of portraits and selfies is evenly distributed across the albums (which seems reasonable given the constraints), then:

- If we denote the number of portraits in each of the 5 non-portrait albums as \( x \), then the total number of portraits would be:
  \[
  P = 5x + \text{portraits in the 2 portrait albums}
  \]
  And similarly for selfies:
  \[
  S = 5y + \text{selfies in the 2 selfie-only albums}
  \]

Since we do not have enough information to calculate \( x \) and \( y \), we cannot definitively state the exact number of portraits and selfies. However, based on the given data, we can say:

- There are 2 portraits albums.
- There are 3 selfie-only albums.

Thus, the final answer, assuming an even distribution, is:
\[
\boxed{\text{There are 2 portraits and 3 selfies}}
\]<|im_end|>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.
Olivia had 2 portrait albums * 9 pictures = <<2*9=18>>18 pictures.
The total of portraits and selfies for Olivia is 27 + 18 = <<27+18=45>>45 pictures.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how long James spends reading, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pages James reads per minute.**
- James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, he reads \( \frac{3}{10} \) pages per minute.

**Step 2: Determine how many pages James reads after going to bed.**
- After going to bed, James reads 18 more pages.

**Step 3: Calculate the time spent reading additional pages.**
- We know that James reads at a rate of \( \frac{3}{10} \) pages per minute.
- To find out how many minutes it takes him to read 18 pages, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Number of pages}}{\text{Pages per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{18}{\frac{3}{10}} \]

**Step 4: Simplify the division.**
- Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 6 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = 60 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: 60 minutes.<|im_end|>","James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Guest Count
- The hotel is initially fully booked with 100 guests.

### Step 2: Early Checkout Guests
- 24 guests chose to check out early.
- After accounting for these early checkouts, we subtract them from the initial guest count.
\[ \text{Remaining guests} = 100 - 24 = 76 \]

### Step 3: Late Checkout Guests
- Let \( x \) be the number of guests who chose a late checkout.
- According to the problem, twice as many people checked in later than those who chose a late checkout.
- Therefore, \( x \) equals half of the remaining guests (after excluding the early checkouts).
\[ x = \frac{76}{2} = 38 \]
- So, 38 guests chose a late checkout.

### Step 4: Check-ins After Dinner
- After dinner, twice as many new guests checked in compared to those who chose a late checkout.
- Therefore, \( 2x \) new guests checked in after dinner.
\[ \text{Check-ins after dinner} = 2 \times 38 = 76 \]

### Step 5: Final Guest Count
- Subtract the initial number of guests from the total after dinner check-ins.
\[ \text{Final guest count} = 100 + 76 - 24 = 152 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{152}

2. **Calculate the total number of bananas picked on Thursday:**
   - John picks 6 bananas on Thursday.

3. **Calculate the total number of bananas picked on Friday:**
   - On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday.
     - Number of bananas picked on Wednesday = 4
     - Triple that amount = \(3 \times 4\)

Let's perform these calculations:
- For Thursday: \(6\) bananas.
- For Friday: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum up all the bananas picked over the three days to find out how many bananas John has in total.

4. **Sum up all the bananas:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold based on the given information.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( L \) represent the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Let \( S \) represent the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know that Teresa's total earnings are $120, and her selling prices are related as follows:
- The price of one large stuffed animal is three times the price of one small stuffed animal.
- Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

From this information, we can write two equations:

1. The total revenue equation:
\[ 3S + LS = 120 \]

2. The relationship between the prices:
\[ L = 3S \]

### Step 3: Substitute into Total Revenue Equation
Substitute \( L = 3S \) into the total revenue equation:
\[ 3S + 3S^2 = 120 \]

### Step 4: Simplify and Solve for \( S \)
First, simplify the equation:
\[ 3S + 3S^2 = 120 \]
Divide everything by 3:
\[ S + S^2 = 40 \]
Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
\[ S^2 + S - 40 = 0 \]

Factor the quadratic equation:
\[ (S + 10)(S - 4) = 0 \]

This gives us two potential solutions for \( S \):
\[ S_1 = -10 \quad \text{(not feasible since } S \text{ must be positive)} \]
\[ S_2 = 4 \]

So, \( S = 4 \).

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \( S = 4 \), then:
\[ L = 3S = 3(4) = 12 \]

Check the total revenue:
\[ 3S + LS = 3(4) + 12(4) = 12 + 48 = 60 \]

Since the calculations match the given conditions, our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
Teresa sold \(\boxed{4}\) small stuffed animals.<|im_end|>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.

Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

                    A man eats 5 ? sandwiches per , day, his wife , eats 4 ! sandwiches per day, and their son ; eats 2 sandwiches per . day. How many sandwiches ! does this family eat in . one ; week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to calculate the daily total for each member and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the daily total for the man:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   
2. **Calculate the daily total for the woman:**
   - The woman eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   
3. **Calculate the daily total for the son:**
   - The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.
   
Next, add these totals together to find out how many sandwiches they all eat together each day:

\[ \text{Total daily sandwiches} = 5 + 4 + 2 \]

\[ \text{Total daily sandwiches} = 11 \]

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week by multiplying the daily total by 7:

\[ \text{Total weekly sandwiches} = 11 \times 7 \]

\[ \text{Total weekly sandwiches} = 77 \]

Therefore, the family eats a total of 77 sandwiches in one week.

**The final answer is:** 77<|im_end|>","The number of sandwiches they eat in one day is 5 + 4 + 2 = <<5+4+2=11>>11 sandwiches.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Suzanne has left after selling cookies and cupcakes, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money from selling cookies**
- Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each.
\[
\text{Money from cookies} = 80 \times \$1 = \$80
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money from selling cupcakes**
- Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each.
\[
\text{Money from cupcakes} = 60 \times \$4 = \$240
\]

**Step 3: Add the money from selling cookies and cupcakes**
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$80 + \$240 = \$320
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount given to her sisters**
- Suzanne gave each of her two sisters $10.
\[
\text{Total given to sisters} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
\]

**Step 5: Subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings**
\[
\text{Remaining money} = \$320 - \$20 = \$300
\]

Therefore, the final answer is that Suzanne has **$300** left from her earnings.<|im_end|>","Suzzane's revenue from the cookies is 80 x $1 = $<<80*1=80>>80.
Her revenue from the cupcakes is 60 x $4 = $<<60*4=240>>240.

She gave a total of 10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20 to her sisters for helping her,
So, Suzzane has $32 - $20 = $300 left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs were not found by the Smith twins.
- The total number of eggs hidden is 100.
- Each of the two Smith twins found 30 eggs.
- Therefore, together they found \( 30 + 30 = 60 \) eggs.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs that were not found by the Smith twins.
- Subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many eggs were found by the Smith twins.
- We already know that the Smith twins found 60 eggs in total.

### Step 4: Identify who found the remaining eggs (except for 10).
- From the previous calculations, we know there are 40 eggs left to be found by others.
- Out of these 40 eggs, only 10 were not found by anyone else.

### Step 5: Calculate how many eggs were found by the friends.
- Since 10 eggs were not found by any friend, the rest must have been found by the friends.
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

### Conclusion:
The friends found 30 eggs.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 eggs.<|im_end|>","The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ore 40 dwarves can mine using steel pickaxes over a period of 30 days. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Ore Mined Per Dwarf Per Day With Steel Pickaxes
First, let's find out how much ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe:

- One dwarf mines \( \frac{1}{2} \) times as much with an iron pickaxe.
- An iron pickaxe allows him to mine 12 pounds of ore per day.

Therefore, with a steel pickaxe (which is stronger), he will mine:

\[ \text{Ore mined per dwarf per day with steel pickaxe} = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Ore Mined Per Dwarf Per Month With Steel Pickaxes
Now, we need to calculate how much ore four dwarves can mine per month with steel pickaxes:

- Each dwarf mines 6 pounds per day.
- There are 30 days in a month.

So, for one dwarf, the total monthly ore mined would be:

\[ \text{Total ore mined per month by one dwarf} = 6 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 180 \text{ pounds/month} \]

Since there are 4 dwarves working together, their combined monthly output would be:

\[ \text{Total ore mined per month by 4 dwarves} = 180 \text{ pounds/month} \times 4 = 720 \text{ pounds/month} \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{720}
\]<|im_end|>","First find how much ore a dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe: 12 pounds/day * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pounds/day

Then multiply the amount one dwarf can mine in a day with a steel pickaxe by the number of dwarves: 36 pounds/day/dwarf * 40 dwarves = <<36*40=1440>>1440 pounds/day
Then multiply the daily amount of ore by the number of days to find the total ore mined in a month: 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = <<1440*30=43200>>43200 pounds/day

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3.
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6.

2. **Calculate the cost per sandwich for each package:**
   - For Package 1 (2 sandwiches for $3):
     \[
     \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]

   - For Package 2 (4 sandwiches for $6):
     \[
     \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$6}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]

3. **Determine if there's a consistent proportionality between the number of sandwiches and the price:**
   Since both packages have the same cost per sandwich ($1.50), they must be proportional.

4. **Use this proportionality to find the cost for the third package:**
   - The third package has 8 sandwiches.
   - We know the total cost should still be proportional to the number of sandwiches based on the consistency observed from the other two packages.

5. **Set up an equation using the known relationship:**
   Let \( P_3 \) represent the price of the third package with 8 sandwiches.
   \[
   \text{Price of } P_3 = k \times (\text{number of sandwiches}) 
   \]
   where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.

6. **Substitute the values into the equation:**
   From Package 1, we know:
   \[
   \$3 = k \times 2
   \]
   Solving for \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{\$3}{2} = \$1.50
   \]

7. **Verify the value of \( k \) with Package 2:**
   \[
   \$6 = k \times 4
   \]
   Using \( k = \$1.50 \):
   \[
   \$6 = \$1.50 \times 4 = \$6
   \]
   This confirms our value of \( k \).

8. **Calculate the price for the third package with 8 sandwiches:**
   \[
   P_3 = k \times 8 = \$1.50 \times 8 = \$12
   \]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\).<|im_end|>","So the price for 1 sandwich is $3 / 2 sandwiches = $<<3/2=1.5>>1.5/sandwich

3. **Total Money Available After Sale**:
   Since Tom receives $1000 from selling his old bedroom, we add this to the cost of the new bedroom set.
   
   Total money available = $3000 (cost of new set) + $1000 (money received from sale)
   
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \$4000
   \]

4. **Monthly Payment on the New Bedroom Set**:
   Tom pays 10% of the total money available every month towards the new bedroom set.
   
   Monthly payment = 10% of $4000

1. **Initial Balloons:**
   - Red balloons: 25
   - Green balloons: 7
   - Yellow balloons: 12

2. **Balloons Bursting Due to Wind:**
   - A gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst.
   - Number of red balloons that burst = \( 0.4 \times 25 = 10 \)
   - Remaining red balloons after bursting: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

3. **Yellow Balloons Released:**
   - Sally releases half of the yellow balloons.
   - Number of yellow balloons released = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \)
   - Remaining yellow balloons: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

4. **Blue Balloons Caught in a Tree:**
   - Sally finds 8 blue balloons in a tree.
   - Adding these to her remaining balloons: \( 15 + 6 + 8 = 29 \)

5. **Final Step:**
   - Sally adds 75% of the remaining blue balloons (which were in the tree) to her remaining balloons.
   - Number of blue balloons added = \( 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \)

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the probability that Marcus will need to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Scenario 1: Substitute Teacher**
   - Probability: 50%
     - If the substitute teacher is present, they will not collect the homework.
   
2. **Scenario 2: Normal Teacher Present**
   - Probability: 50%
     - The normal teacher might or might not extend the deadline for the homework.
   
3. **Scenario 3: No Extension from Normal Teacher**
   - Probability: 60%
     - If the normal teacher does not extend the deadline, Marcus has a 20% chance of getting a personal extension from the teacher himself.
   
Let's calculate the overall probability:

- Probability of Scenario 1 (Substitute Teacher) = 0.5
- Probability of Scenario 2 (Normal Teacher Present) = 0.5
- Probability of Scenario 3 (No Extension from Normal Teacher) = 0.6

Now, we multiply these probabilities by the respective outcomes:

1. For Scenario 1:
\[ P(\text{Homework Needed}) \times 0.5 = 0.5 \]

2. For Scenario 2:
\[ (P(\text{Normal Teacher})) \times (P(\text{Extension})) \times 0.5 + P(\text{Normal Teacher}) \times (P(\text{No Extension})) \times 0.5 = 0.5 \times 0.4 \]
\[ = 0.2 \]

3. For Scenario 3:
\[ (P(\text{Normal Teacher})) \times (P(\text{No Extension})) \times 0.5 + P(\text{Dog Attack}) \times (P(\text{Personal Extension})) \times 0.5 = 0.5 \times 0.6 \]
\[ = 0.3 \]

Adding up all the probabilities gives us the total probability that Marcus will need to turn in his homework:
\[ P(\text{Homework Needed}) = 0.5 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 1.0 \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is \(100\%\).<|im_end|>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%

Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of seats available:**
   The Fine Arts Center can accommodate 6000 people.

2. **Account for the reserved seats:**
   - Seats for graduates (950)
   - Seats for faculty attending (300)

   Let’s subtract these from the total capacity:
   \[
   6000 - 950 = 5050 \quad (\text{seats left after reserving for graduates})
   \]
   \[
   5050 - 300 = 4750 \quad (\text{seats left after reserving for faculty})
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining seats that can be sold:**
   \[
   4750 \quad (\text{remaining seats})
   \]

4. **Divide the remaining seats among the graduates:**
   Since there are \(n\) graduates, we divide the remaining seats by \(n\):
   \[
   \frac{4750}{n}
   \]

Let's assume \(n\) is the number of graduates. We need to determine \(n\) first.

Since we don't have the exact number of graduates, let's denote the number of graduates as \(n\).

Now, we know that each graduate receives an equal number of tickets. To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{\frac{4750}{n}}{n}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\text{Number of tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{n^2}
\]

Given that the total number of tickets must be divided equally among all graduates, and knowing that the total number of tickets must be an integer, we conclude that \(n^2\) must be a divisor of 4750.

However, without specific information about the number of graduates or the total number of tickets, we cannot calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate receives.

**Final Answer:** 
If we had more information such as the number of graduates, we could compute the exact number of tickets each graduate receives. Without additional data, the expression remains:

\[
\boxed{\frac{4750}{n^2}}
\]<|im_end|>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

                    question:
                    Grandpa loves ; to . eat jelly beans, but ; how many jelly beans he can eat depends on the ! size of the beans. !  . It ; takes 75 large ! jelly beans to fill Grandpa . up.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat based on his consumption rate for different sized jelly beans.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of jelly beans per unit area**:
   - Given that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa's container.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of large jelly beans per unit area (e.g., per square inch or cubic centimeter).
   - Since 75 large jelly beans = 1 unit volume, then \( L = \frac{1}{75} \).

2. **Calculate the number of medium-sized jelly beans per unit area**:
   - It is given that Grandpa eats twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large ones.
   - Therefore, Medium-sized jelly beans per unit area (\( M \)) = \( 2L \).
   - Substituting \( L \), we get: 
     \[
     M = 2 \times \frac{1}{75} = \frac{2}{75}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of small-sized jelly beans per unit area**:
   - The total number of small jelly beans consumed is equal to three times the number of medium-sized jelly beans eaten.
   - Small jelly beans per unit area (\( S \)) = \( 3M \).
   - Substituting \( M \), we get:
     \[
     S = 3 \times \frac{2}{75} = \frac{6}{75} = \frac{2}{25}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat**:
   - To find out how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat in total, multiply the number of small jelly beans per unit area by the total surface area of the container.
   - If \( A \) represents the total surface area of the container, then the total number of small jelly beans (\( T \)) = \( SA \cdot S \).
   - However, since we don't have the actual surface area of the container, let’s assume the container has an area such that one large jelly bean fills up a certain amount of space, say 1 cm³. This assumption simplifies our calculation.
   
   - For simplicity, if 75 large jelly beans fill the container, then 1 cm³ of the container would be filled by 75 large jelly beans.
   - Hence, \( A = 75 \text{ cm}^2 \) (assuming 1 cm³ = 1 cm² for simplicity).

5. **Calculate the total number of small jelly beans**:
   - Using the number of small jelly beans per unit area:
     \[
     T = A \times S = 75 \text{ cm}^2 \times \frac{2}{25} \text{ small jelly beans/cm}^2 = 6 \text{ small jelly beans}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Grandpa can eat a total of **6 small jelly beans**.<|im_end|>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.
If 1 medium-sized bean is the same as 3 small beans, then 150 medium-sized beans are equal to 150*3=<<150*3=450>>450 small jelly beans.

                    question:
                    . Melissa is ! summoned to jury duty. She spends ? 6 hours ; a day for 3 days listening to ! a court , case. If Melissa is paid ? $15 per day but also ? has , to pay $3 ! for parking ? each day, how much jury pay : does : she make per hour after ? expenses?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Melissa makes in total from her jury service, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spent on jury duty.**

Melissa works for 6 hours per day for 3 days.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 18 \, \text{hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine Melissa's total earnings from the court.**

She earns $15 per day for her work.

\[ \text{Total earnings from court} = 15 \, \text{\$/day} \times 18 \, \text{days} = 270 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 3: Calculate Melissa's total expenses.**

Each day, she pays $3 for parking.

\[ \text{Total daily expense} = 3 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Since she works for 3 days:

\[ \text{Total expenses} = 3 \, \text{\$/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 9 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings.**

\[ \text{Net earnings} = 270 \, \text{\$} - 9 \, \text{\$} = 261 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 5: Convert the net earnings into an hourly rate.**

There are 24 hours in a day, so there are \(24\) hours in \(3\) days.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{261 \, \text{\$}}{24 \, \text{hours}} \approx 11.25 \, \text{\$/hour} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{11.25}
\]<|im_end|>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Ted spends on books and pencils separately, then sum those amounts.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the books.
Ted buys 3 books at $16 each.
Cost of books = Number of books × Price per book
= 3 × $16
= $48

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pencils.
Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each.
Cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Price per pencil
= 3 × $6
= $18

Step 3: Sum the costs of books and pencils to find the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of books + Cost of pencils
= $48 + $18
= $66

Therefore, the final answer is: The total amount Ted spends is $66.<|im_end|>","Ted spent a total of 3*16 = <<3*16=48>>48 dollars on books.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of bottles needed:**
   - The width of the driveway is 24 feet.
   - Each bottle is placed every 3 feet.
   
   To find out how many bottles there are, we divide the length of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
   \[
   \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time to place each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.

3. **Calculate the total time for all bottles:**
   - Since there are 8 bottles, and it takes 5 seconds to move between them, the total time to place all the bottles is:
     \[
     8 \text{ bottles} \times 5 \text{ seconds/bottle} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 40 seconds. 

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{40 \text{ seconds}}
\]<|im_end|>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of apples:**
   - There are 40 apples in one box.
   - Uncle Franky has two boxes, so we need to find out how many apples that would be.
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 40 \times 2 = 80
     \]

2. **Calculate how many packs of eight apples he can make from the total number of apples:**
   - We need to divide the total number of apples (which is 80) by the number of apples per pack (which is 8).
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - If each pack contains 8 apples and there are 10 such packs, then:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 10 \times 8 = 80

   - This confirms our calculation.

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 10 packs of apples.<|im_end|>","There are 2 x 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 apples in two boxes.

<|im_start|>system
To determine if Amor has enough money left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she bought and then subtract that from the amount of money she started with.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese.
- Price of Parmesan cheese = $11 per pound
- Amount of Parmesan cheese bought = 2 pounds
- Cost of Parmesan cheese = $11/pound × 2 pounds = $22

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the Mozzarella cheese.
- Price of Mozzarella cheese = $6 per pound
- Amount of Mozzarella cheese bought = 3 pounds
- Cost of Mozzarella cheese = $6/pound × 3 pounds = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the cheese.
- Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of Mozzarella cheese
- Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Step 4: Subtract the total cost of the cheese from the initial amount of money Amor had.
- Initial amount of money = $50
- Money left after purchase = Initial amount - Total cost of cheese
- Money left after purchase = $50 - $40 = $10

Final Answer: Yes, Amor will have $10 left to buy more meat.<|im_end|>","The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total earnings without considering the time difference:**

   - Jim earns $50,000 per year for 4 years after graduating.
     \[ Total = \$50,000/year × 4 years = \$200,000 \]

2. **Determine the amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the student loan debt:**

   - The total amount of money Jim needs to repay is the same as the total amount he earned during his 4-year post-college career, which we calculated to be $200,000.

3. **Calculate the total number of years required to earn the equivalent of the loans:**

   - Since Jim has already worked for 4 years before going to college and now wants to work for an additional 4 years (because he only works for 2 years), the total number of years required is:
     \[ Years = 4 years + 4 years = 8 years \]

4. **Compare the two scenarios to find out how much longer it would take Jim to reach the same point if he hadn't gone to college at all:**

   - Without going to college, Jim could have worked for the full 4 years instead of just 2 years.
   - Therefore, the time saved on this path is:
     \[ Time Saved = 4 years - 2 years = 2 years \]

Therefore, it would take Jim **6 years** to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. This is because he would need to work for 2 extra years outside of college to make up for the time lost in college.<|im_end|>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the dimensions of the fabric needed:**
   - The original bed measurements are 6 feet long and 8 feet wide.
   - Jim needs two pieces of fabric.
   - Each piece must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

2. **Determine the new length and width for one piece of fabric:**
   - Original bed length (L) = 6 feet
     - New length (L') = L + 2 feet = 6 + 2 = 8 feet
   - Original bed width (W) = 8 feet
     - New width (W') = W + 2 feet = 8 + 2 = 10 feet

3. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area of one piece of fabric (A) = Length × Width
   - A = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

4. **Calculate the total area for two pieces of fabric:**
   - Total area (T) = 2 × Area of one piece of fabric
   - T = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet

5. **Add up all areas for both pieces of fabric:**
   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the total area by 2.
   - Total fabric needed = T * 2 = 160 square feet * 2 = 320 square feet

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on each day from Monday to Wednesday and then sum them up.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

**Monday:**
- The post office delivered 425 letters.

**Tuesday:**
- According to the problem, on Tuesday they delivered **17 more than one-fifth as many letters as Monday**.
  
First, let's find out what one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday is:
\[ \frac{425}{5} = 85 \]

So, 17 more than this amount would be:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
Therefore, on Tuesday, they delivered **102 letters**.

**Wednesday:**
- They delivered **5 more than twice as many letters as they delivered on Tuesday**.
  
On Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters, so twice that amount would be:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, 5 more than this amount would be:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
Therefore, on Wednesday, they delivered **209 letters**.

Now, let's add up all the letters delivered over these three days:
\[ 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) \]

\[ = 736 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday is **736**.<|im_end|>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters

                    question:
                    Molly is . catering a birthday party for : her sister and invited 16 people. 10 people want the chicken salad which is ! $6.50 per , person and . 6 people want . the ? pasta salad at $6 per person. ? What is : the , total , amount Molly ? will : pay for the catering?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for Molly's catering event. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for those who want chicken salad
- Number of people wanting chicken salad = 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad = $6.50

\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 65.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for those who want pasta salad
- Number of people wanting pasta salad = 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad = $6

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 36.00
\]

### Step 3: Add both costs together to get the total amount Molly will pay for catering.

\[
\text{Total amount Molly will pay} = \text{Total cost for chicken salad} + \text{Total cost for pasta salad}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount Molly will pay} = 65.00 + 36.00
\]

\[
\text{Total amount Molly will pay} = 101.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **$101.00**.<|im_end|>","Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.
Multiply the amount of people who want pasta salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 6 x $6.00 = $<<6*6=36>>36.
The total cost of chicken salad and pasta salad is $65 + $36 = $<<65+36=101>>101.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and calculate the winnings and losses for each race.

### Step 1: Determine Johnny's initial loss from the first race.
Johnny lost $5 on the first race.

### Step 2: Calculate the winnings from the second race.
On the second race, Johnny wins $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost (which was $5).
- Twice the amount lost = $5 * 2 = $10
- Winnings from the second race = $1 + $10 = $11

### Step 3: Calculate the winnings from the third race.
On the third race, Johnny loses 1.5 times what he won in the second race ($11).
- Loss on the third race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5

### Step 4: Sum up all winnings and losses over the three races.
- First Race: -$5
- Second Race: +$11
- Third Race: -$16.5

Total winnings and losses = -5 + 11 - 16.5 = -10.5

### Step 5: Calculate the average loss per race.
Since there were three races, the average loss per race is:
\[ \text{Average loss} = \frac{-10.5}{3} = -3.5 \]

So, Johnny lost an average of **$3.5** per race.<|im_end|>","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11
On the third race he lost $15 because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
He lost a total of $20 on the first and third races because 15 + 5 = <<15+5=20>>20

He lost $9 that day because 11 - 20 = <<11-20=-9>>-9
He lost an average of $3 per race because 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people living in all cities across all countries.

- Each country has 5 cities.
- Each city has 1000 people.

So, for one country:
\[ \text{Total people per country} = 5 \times 1000 = 5000 \]

Since there are 26 countries in South America:
\[ \text{Total people across all countries} = 26 \times 5000 = 130,000 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of people living in these cities.

We know that the entire population (including those in these cities) lives in these 26 countries.

### Step 3: Verify if the given information matches our calculation.

The question states that the ""whole population"" lives in these cities. This implies that the total population of these cities must be equal to or greater than the total population of South America.

Given that we have calculated the total population of these cities as 130,000, which is less than the actual total population of South America (which is not provided), but based on the information given, this is the correct approach to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:

The total number of people living in these cities is **130,000**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new heights for Cole and Xavier:**
   - **Cole's growth**: 
     \[
     \text{Cole's original height} = 50 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cole's growth} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cole's new height} = 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Xavier's growth**:
     \[
     \text{Xavier's original height} = 4 \text{ feet} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Xavier's growth} = 3 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Xavier's new height} = 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Find the difference in their heights**:
   \[
   \text{Difference in height} = \text{Cole's new height} - \text{Xavier's new height}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference in height} = 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch}
   \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height, now, is \(1\) inch.<|im_end|>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.

Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person received based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) be the amount of money the first person receives.

### Step 2: Express the Amounts in Terms of \( x \)
- The second person takes \( x + 80 \).
- The third person takes twice what the second person gets, so the third person takes \( 2(x + 80) \).

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
The total amount distributed is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \] 
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person receives $420.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{420}
\]<|im_end|>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.
The second took X+<<+80=80>>80.

X + X + 80 + 2*X + 80*2 = 1920
X*4 + 240 = 1920.
X*4 = 1680.
X = <<420=420>>420.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - The problem states that they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.
   - There were 7 days in a week, so there are 2 weeks (or 14 days) in total.
   - Each painter worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \times 14 \) days.

Let's calculate the total number of days worked per painter:

\[
\text{Total days per painter} = \frac{3}{8} \times 14 = \frac{3 \times 14}{8} = \frac{42}{8} = 5.25 \text{ days}
\]

So, each painter worked for 5.25 days over the course of 3 weeks.

2. **Convert the total working time from days to hours:**

Since there are 24 hours in one day, we can convert 5.25 days into hours:

\[
\text{Total hours worked per painter} = 5.25 \times 24 = 126 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, each painter put in a total of **126 hours** of work during the period described.

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set. Let's denote the number of balls retrieved in the first, second, and third sets as \( F \), \( S \), and \( T \) respectively.

We know that:
1. The total number of balls retrieved is 19.
2. The first set has 4 more balls than the second set.
3. The third set has half as many balls as the second set.

From these points, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( F + S + T = 19 \)
2. \( F = S + 4 \)
3. \( T = \frac{S}{2} \)

First, let's substitute \( F \) and \( T \) from equations (2) and (3) into equation (1):

\( (S + 4) + S + \frac{S}{2} = 19 \)

Now, combine like terms:

\( S + 4 + S + \frac{S}{2} = 19 \)

Combine the \( S \)'s on one side:

\( 2S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = 19 \)

Convert \( 2S \) to a fraction for easier combination:

\( \frac{4S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = 19 \)

Combine the fractions:

\( \frac{5S}{2} + 4 = 19 \)

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\( \frac{5S}{2} = 15 \)

Multiply both sides by 2/5 to isolate \( S \):

\( S = 6 \)

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( F \) and \( T \):

\( F = S + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)

\( T = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

So, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set, 6 balls in the second set, and 3 balls in the third set.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the depreciation factor**
- The car depreciates at a rate of 21% per year.
- This means that after one year, 89% (or 1 - 21%) of the car's value remains.

**Step 2: Determine the depreciation factor**
\[ \text{Depreciation Factor} = 1 - \frac{\text{Depreciation Rate}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Depreciation Factor} = 1 - \frac{21}{100} \]
\[ \text{Depreciation Factor} = 1 - 0.21 \]
\[ \text{Depreciation Factor} = 0.79 \]

**Step 3: Apply the depreciation factor to the initial price**
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times \text{Depreciation Factor} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = \$20,000 \times 0.79 \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = \$15,800 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in 2010 would be **$15,800**.<|im_end|>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.

The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

1. Determine how many books are written in English.
2. Determine how many books are written in German.
3. Subtract the number of books written in English and German from the total number of books to find out how many books are written in Spanish.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of books written in English.
Half of the books are written in English. Since there are 50 books in total, half of 50 is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]
So, 25 books are written in English.

Next, let's move on to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate the number of books written in German.
We know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find out how many books are written in German, we calculate 10% of 50:
\[ 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]
So, 5 books are written in German.

Now, let's proceed to the third step:

Step 3: Calculate the number of books written in Spanish.
Since all other books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of books written in English and German from the total number of books:
\[ 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]<|im_end|>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.

So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

                    question:
                    : Ingrid : drinks 8 cups of water , every : day.  If there are 16 cups . in a gallon, how many gallons of , water does , she ; drink in 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how much water Ingrid drinks over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid consumes in 30 days.
Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day.

Total cups consumed = Number of days × Cups per day
\[ \text{Total cups} = 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total cups} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 2: Convert the total number of cups into gallons.
We know that there are 16 cups in one gallon.

To find out how many gallons of water she drinks, divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon.

\[ \text{Gallons} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per gallon}} \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(15\) gallons.<|im_end|>","She drinks 8 cups of water a day so after 30 days she drinks 8*30 = <<8*30=240>>240 cups of water

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of people on the train after each stop. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Condition
Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

\[ \text{Initial Number} = 120 \]

### Step 2: First Stop
At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.

\[ \text{Number After First Stop} = 120 + 20 = 140 \]

### Step 3: Second Stop
At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train, and twice that number (i.e., \(2 \times 50\) or 100) board the train.

\[ \text{People Descending} = 50 \]
\[ \text{People Boarding} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

\[ \text{Number After Second Stop} = 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 \]

### Step 4: Third Stop
At the third stop, 80 more people descend from the train.

\[ \text{Number After Third Stop} = 190 - 80 = 110 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is **110**.

To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on athletic gear.
- **Tank top**: $10
- **Running shorts**: $5

Total for athletic gear = Tank top + Running shorts
= $10 + $5 = $15

### Step 2: Determine the discounted price of the tennis shoes.
- Original price of tennis shoes = $48
- Sale price of tennis shoes (half off) = $48 / 2 = $24

### Step 3: Apply the coupon discount to the total spent on athletic gear.
- Coupon discount = $2 off the package of $8 = $2

Final amount after applying the coupon = Total spent on athletic gear - Coupon discount
= $15 - $2 = $13

### Final Answer:
Alison spent $13 on athletic gear.<|im_end|>","The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost of installing new square floor tiles on your kitchen floor, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of tiles needed
First, we need to find out how many square tiles you'll need to cover the entire floor.

- **Area of the kitchen floor**: 200 Square Feet (Sq Ft)
- **Side length of each tile**: 1 Foot (ft)

Since the tiles are square, the area of one tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ sq ft}\).

Now, divide the total area of the floor by the area of one tile to get the number of tiles required:
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ sq ft}}{1 \text{ sq ft/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tiles
Each tile costs $12.

Therefore, the total cost for all tiles can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2400 \]

### Conclusion
The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with new square floor tiles would be $2400.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $2400.<|im_end|>","The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt
If the kitchen has a total area of 200 SqFt then my kitchen needs 200/1 = <<200/1=200>>200 square tiles
If each tile costs $12, then 200 square tiles will cost $12 * 200 = $<<12*200=2400>>2,400

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the increased cost per month due to the accident:**
   - The normal cost per month is $120.
   - The increase in cost due to the accident is 60% more than the normal cost.

   Calculation for the increased cost:
   \[
   \text{Increased Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} + (\text{Normal Cost} \times \text{Increase Percentage})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Cost} = \$120 + (120 \times 0.6)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Cost} = \$120 + \$72
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Cost} = \$192
   \]

2. **Calculate the total monthly cost after the accident:**
   - After the accident, James pays $192 per month.

3. **Calculate the total annual cost after the accident:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total annual cost is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Monthly Cost} \times \text{Number of Months}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = \$192 \times 12

     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = \$2,304

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of sheets per load.
- Greg has 4 twin beds, so he needs 8 sheets for these beds (since each bed requires one sheet).
- He also has 1 king-sized bed, requiring 2 sheets.

So, for each load of laundry:
\[ \text{Total sheets needed} = 8 (\text{twin}) + 2 (\text{kings}) = 10 \text{ sheets} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many loads fit in his washing machine.
- The laundry machine can wash up to 2 sets of sheets for twins at a time.
- It can also wash up to 1 set of sheets for kings at a time.

Given that each load washes 10 sheets, we need to determine how many such loads fit within the capacity limits:
- For twins: \( \frac{2}{\text{twins}} = 2 \) loads per wash cycle.
- For kings: \( \frac{1}{\text{kings}} = 1 \) load per wash cycle.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks in a year.
There are 52 weeks in a year.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of loads in a year.
Since he washes 2 loads of twin sheets per wash cycle and 1 load of king sheets per wash cycle, the total number of loads per week is:
\[ \text{Loads per week} = 2 \times \text{twins} + 1 \times \text{kings} \]
\[ \text{Loads per week} = 2 \times 4 + 1 \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Loads per week} = 8 + 1 \]
\[ \text{Loads per week} = 9 \]

Now, multiply the weekly loads by the number of weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Total loads per year} = 9 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total loads per year} = 468 \]

Therefore, Greg does **468** loads of laundry in a year.<|im_end|>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of movies watched on both days:**
   - On Saturday, Jill and her friends watch 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies as on Saturday.

2. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   - Since they watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday,
     \[
     \text{Number of movies on Sunday} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of movies watched over two days:**
   - Total movies for one weekend (Saturday + Sunday) = \(4 + 2 = 6\).

4. **Determine the number of weekends within four weeks:**
   - There are 4 weeks, and since each week consists of 2 days,
     \[
     \text{Total number of weekends in 4 weeks} = \frac{4 \times 2}{1} = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Multiply the number of movies per weekend by the number of weekends,
     \[
     \text{Total movies in 4 weeks} = 6 \times 8 = 48
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. The total number of movies that Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks is 48.<|im_end|>","They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much cat food Imma uses per meal:**
   - Imma feeds her cats 3 times a day.
   - Each feeding is with 60 grams of cat food.

2. **Calculate the total amount of cat food used per day:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily usage} = \text{Number of meals per day} \times \text{Amount per meal}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total daily usage} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ grams}
   \]

3. **Determine how long 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily usage:**
   - We need to find out how many days (d) 720 grams of cat food will last if she consumes 180 grams per day.
   - The equation for this is:
     \[
     \text{Total food available} = \text{Daily usage} \times \text{Number of days}
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for d:
     \[
     d = \frac{\text{Total food available}}{\text{Daily usage}}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     d = \frac{720}{180} = 4 \text{ days}

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices each person ate and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of slices in all pizzas:**
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of slices eaten by Becky:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.

3. **Find out how many slices Jake ate:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
   - According to the problem, Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   \[
   \text{Becky's slices} = J + 3
   \]
   - Given that Becky ate 10 slices:
   \[
   10 = J + 3
   \]
   - Solve for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   \[
   S = 2J
   \]
   - Since Jake ate 7 slices:
   \[
   S = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

5. **Sum the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:**
   - Calculate the total slices eaten by adding up their individual amounts.
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 10 (\text{Becky}) + 7 (\text{Jake}) + 14 (\text{Silvia})
   \]
   - Simplify the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]<|im_end|>","Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.

                    Betsy , and ! Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took , 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. The ; meal , was ; made in 98 : minutes. How many ; minutes long was : Betsy's part?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Betsy's part of the meal took. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the number of minutes that Donovan's part took.
- According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( x + 18 \) minutes.

### Step 2: Set Up an Equation
The total time taken for both parts combined is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]

### Step 4: Isolate \( x \)
Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2x = 70 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{70}{2} \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, Donovan's part took 35 minutes.

### Step 6: Find Betsy's Part
Since Betsy's part takes \( x + 18 \) minutes, substitute \( x = 35 \):

\[ \text{Betsy's part} = 35 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Betsy's part} = 53 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took **53** minutes.<|im_end|>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes
Betsy = D + <<+18=18>>18
2D + 18 = 98
2D = 80
D = <<40=40>>40
Betsy = 40 + 18 = <<40+18=58>>58 minutes
Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

                    question:
                    ? Hannah ! slips on ! a ! banana peel and breaks her : arm. The ? doctor charges her $200 for the ; cast, ? $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, $4/pill for 30 painkillers, and $6/hour for a . mandatory minimum of 2 . hours of parking. How ? much does the : doctor's ! visit cost total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to consider all the different charges mentioned in the question. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the cast**: 
   - The cast costs $200.

2. **Cost of the visit**:
   - The visit is charged at $300 per hour.
   - It lasted for 30 minutes (which is half an hour).
   
   Therefore, the hourly rate for 30 minutes would be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$300}{\text{Time}} = \frac{\$300}{0.5 \text{ hours}}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{Hourly rate} = \$600 \text{ per hour}
   \]

3. **Cost of the painkillers**:
   - Each pill costs $4.
   - She takes 30 pills.
   
   So, the total cost for the painkillers would be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for painkillers} = 30 \times \$4 = \$120
   \]

4. **Cost of parking**:
   - The parking charge is given as a mandatory minimum of 2 hours at $6 per hour.
   - Since she only stayed for 30 minutes, we can assume the parking charge will still apply since there is no mention of any time limit or discount for short stays.
   
   Therefore, the parking charge would be:
   \[
   \text{Parking charge} = 2 \times \$6 = \$12
   \]

Now, let's sum up all these costs:
- Cast: $200
- Painkillers: $120
- Parking: $12

Adding these together gives us the total cost:
\[
\$200 + \$120 + \$12 = \$332
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is \( \boxed{332} \).<|im_end|>","First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours

Then find the total cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $<<4*30=120>>120
Then find the cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $<<6*2=12>>12
Then add all the different costs to find the total cost: $12 + $120 + $150 + $200 = $<<12+120+150+200=482>>482

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many emails don't require a response:**
   - James receives 80 emails per day.
   - 20% of these emails do not require a response.

   Calculate the number of emails that don't require a response:
   \[
   \text{Number of emails without response} = 80 \times 20\%
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of emails without response} = 80 \times 0.20 = 16
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of emails that do require a response:**
   - Subtract the number of emails without response from the total number of emails received daily.
   \[
   \text{Number of emails requiring response} = 80 - 16
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of emails requiring response} = 64
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of emails responded to over a 5-day work week:**
   - Multiply the number of emails required to be responded to each day by the number of days in the work week.
   \[
   \text{Total emails responded} = 64 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total emails responded} = 320

To determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of visitors for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - Number of classes = 32

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Number of classes = 2 * (number of classes on Monday)  
     \( \text{Number of classes on Tuesday} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Number of classes = 3 * (number of classes on Tuesday)
     \( \text{Number of classes on Wednesday} = 3 \times 64 = 192 \)

4. **Thursday:**
   - Number of classes = 30

5. **Friday:**
   - Number of classes = 25

Now, let's add up the number of classes from each day:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total number of classes} &= \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday} \\

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of big coupons
Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons. According to the problem, he also wants to send ""twice as many big coupons"" as small ones.

- Number of small coupons = 700
- Number of big coupons = 2 × Small coupons = 2 × 700 = 1400

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per type of coupon
- Cost per small coupon = $0.05 (since each small coupon costs 5 cents)
- Cost per big coupon = $0.15 (since each big coupon costs 15 cents)

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for small coupons
- Total cost for small coupons = Number of small coupons × Cost per small coupon
- Total cost for small coupons = 700 × $0.05 = $35.00

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for big coupons
- Total cost for big coupons = Number of big coupons × Cost per big coupon
- Total cost for big coupons = 1400 × $0.15 = $210.00

### Step 5: Add the costs together to find the total postage expense
- Total postage expense = Total cost for small coupons + Total cost for big coupons
- Total postage expense = $35.00 + $210.00 = $245.00

### Final Answer

   - One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.

2. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in Sidney's order:**
   - Sidney ordered 10 meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Total meatballs = Number of sandwiches × Meatballs per sandwich
   - Total meatballs = 10 × 4 = 40 meatballs.

3. **Calculate the number of meatballs in Sidney's remaining order after eating some:**
   - Sidney ate 3 less than 10 sandwiches.
   - Sidney ate = 10 - 3 = 7 sandwiches.
   - Remaining meatballs = Original total - Eaten amount
   - Remaining meatballs = 40 - (7 × 4) = 40 - 28 = 12 meatballs.

4. **Calculate the number of meatballs in Mark's order:**
   - Mark ate 4 out of Sidney's remaining sandwiches.
   - Number of sandwiches Mark ate = Remaining sandwiches × Mark's fraction
   - Number of sandwiches Mark ate = 7 × 4 = 28 sandwiches.
   - Remaining sandwiches for Mark = Remaining sandwiches - Mark's eaten amount
   - Remaining sandwiches for Mark = 7 - 4 = 3 sandwiches.

5. **Calculate the number of meatballs in Mark's remaining order:**
   - Each sandwich still has 4 meatballs.
   - Remaining meatballs for Mark = Sandwiches left × Meatballs per sandwich
   - Remaining meatballs for Mark = 3 × 4 = 12 meatballs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched:**
   - Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched.

2. **Calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures:**
   - A quarter of the trucks failed.
   - Number of failing trucks = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \)
   - Calculation: \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) trucks.

3. **Calculate the number of trucks that did not experience any problems:**
   - Total trucks - Failing trucks = Non-failing trucks
   - Calculation: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) trucks.

4. **Calculate the amount of fertilizer each truck can carry:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer.

5. **Calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered by the trucks without issues:**
   - Total non-failing trucks * Fertilizer per truck = Total delivered fertilizer
   - Calculation: \( 15 \times 20 \)

6. **Calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered by all trucks:**
   - Total delivered fertilizer (as calculated above).

7. **Subtract the amount of fertilizer lost due to mechanical failure:**
   - Total delivered fertilizer - Amount lost due to failure = Remaining fertilizer.

8. **Final calculation:**
   - The remaining fertilizer will be the amount that reaches the farmers.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. **Total trucks dispatched:** 20
2. **Failing trucks:** \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \)
3. **Non-failing trucks:** 20 - 5 = 15
4. **Fertilizer per truck:** 20 tons
5. **Total delivered fertilizer:** \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) tons

Since no additional information about the amount lost or recovered is provided, we assume the entire batch of 300 tons was successfully delivered. Therefore, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons.

**The final answer is:**

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of butter needed
Dennis wants to make 6 dozen croissants. Since he uses 1 pound of butter per dozen croissants, he will need:

\[ 6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound/dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost without any discount
Given that the price of butter is $4.00 per pound, the cost for 6 pounds would be:

\[ 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00/\text{pound} = \$24.00 \]

### Step 3: Apply the discount on butter
The promotion offers a 50% discount on the butter. Therefore, he only pays half the price of the butter. 

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$24.00 \times 0.5 = \$12.00 \]

### Final Answer
The final answer is: \(\boxed{\$12.00}\)<|im_end|>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter
The butter is $4.00 a pound and currently on sale for buy one get one half off so every unit of 2 pounds of butter will cost 4*1.5 = $<<4*1.5=6.00>>6.00
He needs 6 pounds of butter and the current promotion is for a unit of 2 pounds of butter so he needs to buy 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 units worth of butter
The sale price is $6.00 per 2 pounds of butter and he needs to buy 3 units of butter so 6*3 = $<<6*3=18.00>>18.00 worth of butter

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.

   Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 guests.

2. **Account for those who couldn't attend:**
   - Out of these 45 guests, only 4 were unable to come.

   Number of guests that actually attended = 45 - 4 = 41 guests.

3. **Determine the additional charge per guest:**
   - For the first 20 guests (the initial fee), there is no additional charge.
   - For every additional guest beyond 20, an extra charge of $6 applies.

   Since we have 41 guests attending, we can calculate how many additional guests there are:
   
   Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests.

   Cost for the additional guests = 21 guests * $6/guest = $126.

4. **Add up all costs:**
   - Initial rental fee: $125
   - Cost for additional guests: $126

   Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

Therefore, the total cost for the party will be $251.<|im_end|>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much money Maggie initially had:**
   - We know that Maggie spent 25% (or a quarter) of her total amount.
   - Let \( M \) be the total amount of money Maggie had.
   - According to the problem, Maggie spent \( \frac{M}{4} \).
   - After spending, she has \( \frac{3M}{4} \) left.

2. **Set up an equation for Maggie’s remaining money:**
   - Since Maggie has $60 left after spending, we can write:
     \[
     \frac{3M}{4} = 60
     \]

3. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     3M = 240
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     M = 80
     \]

4. **Calculate Maggie's initial total amount:**
   - Maggie spent \( \frac{M}{4} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) dollars.
   - Therefore, Maggie initially had:
     \[
     M = 80
     \]

5. **Calculate Riza's initial total amount:**
   - Riza spent \( \frac{M}{3} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \) dollars.
   - So, Riza spent approximately $26.67 and thus had:
     \[
     \text{Riza's initial total} = 80 - 26.67 = 53.33
     \]

6. **Determine how much money each person has left:**
   - Maggie has already spent $20, so she has:
     \[
     80 - 20 = 60
     \]
   - Riza still has her full amount, which is:
     \[
     53.33
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.
So, Maggie is left with $60 - $15 = $<<60-15=45>>45.

So, Riza is left with $60 - $20 = $<<60-20=40>>40.
Thus, they have a total of $45 + $40 = $<<45+40=85>>85 left.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey consumes per day. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bananas consumed by all monkeys in one day.
Mr. Robles has 315 bananas.

Step 2: Calculate the daily banana consumption for each monkey.
- Each monkey eats bananas at different rates based on their specific requirements.

#### Monkey 1:
- Monkey 1 eats 10 bananas per day.

#### Monkey 2:
- Monkey 2 eats 4 more bananas per day than Monkey 1.
- Therefore, Monkey 2 eats \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas per day.

#### Monkey 3:
- We need to find out how many bananas Monkey 3 eats per day.
- First, let's calculate the total number of bananas eaten by Monkeys 1 and 2 in one day:
  \[
  10 \text{ (Monkey 1)} + 14 \text{ (Monkey 2)} = 24 \text{ bananas}
  \]
- Subtract this from the total number of bananas available:
  \[
  315 - 24 = 291 \text{ bananas remaining}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of bananas Monkey 3 eats per day.
- Since the remaining bananas after feeding Monkeys 1 and 2 amount to 291 bananas, these will be divided among the three monkeys.
- To find out how many bananas Monkey 3 eats, divide the remaining bananas by the number of monkeys:
\[
\frac{291}{3} = 97 \text{ bananas per day}
\]

Thus, the third monkey eats **97 bananas** per day.<|im_end|>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the Puzzle Pieces**:
   - The puzzle has 500 pieces in total.

2. **First Puzzling Session**:
   - Teddy finished half of the 500-piece puzzle.
   - Half of 500 is calculated as: \( \frac{500}{2} = 250 \).
   - So, Teddy placed 250 pieces in the first session.

3. **Second Puzzling Session**:
   - Teddy started a second 500-piece puzzle.
   - He finished the second puzzle within an hour.
   - Since he finished exactly one whole puzzle (500 pieces), we assume he completed the entire puzzle without any breaks or pauses.
   - Therefore, Teddy placed all 500 pieces from the second puzzle.

4. **Total Pieces Placed**:
   - From the first session, Teddy placed 250 pieces.
   - From the second session, Teddy placed 500 pieces.
   - Total pieces placed by Teddy = \( 250 + 500 = 750 \).

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the roses.
- Each rose costs $2.
- Jenny buys 15 roses.

\[ \text{Total cost of roses} = 15 \times 2 = \$30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the other items (if any).
Since the problem doesn't specify what else Jenny might have purchased or if there were additional items, we'll assume no other purchases were made except for the roses.

### Step 3: Determine how much money Jenny has initially.
Jenny arrives with five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from her initial amount to find out how much money she spends on roses.
\[ \text{Money spent on roses} = \$30 \]
\[ \text{Remaining money after buying roses} = \$25 - \$30 = -\$5 \]

This negative value indicates that Jenny would not be able to afford more roses with her current funds. She would need an additional $5 to purchase more roses.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of quarters she needs to make up the remaining $5.
Since each quarter is worth $0.25, we can calculate the number of quarters needed as follows:

\[ \text{Number of quarters needed} = \frac{\$5}{\$0.25} = 20 \]

Therefore, Jenny will leave with **20 quarters**.

To determine how much money Terry makes from selling his products, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of item separately and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the revenue from milkshakes
- Number of milkshakes sold: 6
- Price per milkshake: $5.50

\[ \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from burger platters
- Number of burger platters sold: 9
- Price per burger platter: $11

\[ \text{Revenue from burger platters} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the revenue from sodas
- Number of sodas sold: 20
- Price per soda: $1.50

\[ \text{Revenue from sodas} = 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all revenues
Now, add the revenues from each item together:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

1. **First Train Schedule**:
   - First train arrives: 10 minutes from now.
   - First train stays in station: 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train Schedule**:
   - Second train arrives: Half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - Second train stays in station: A quarter of the time the first train stayed = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train Schedule**:
   - Third train arrives: An hour later than the second train.
   - Third train leaves immediately after arriving.

4. **Fourth Train Schedule**:
   - Fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Fourth train is the one Paul wants to take.

Now let's calculate:

- The third train will stay in the station for 5 minutes before leaving.
- After the third train leaves, the fourth train arrives and stays for 20 minutes.

So, the total waiting time for Paul is the sum of these times:

\[ \text{Total Waiting Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 25 \text{ minutes} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate total number of toothpicks saved:**
   - Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Total saved} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ toothpicks}

2. **Determine how long it would take Melanie to save 200 toothpicks:**
   
   We know that Melanie currently has 120 toothpicks saved. So we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach 200.

   \[
   \text{Additional needed} = 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to save these additional toothpicks:**

   Since Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week, we can determine the number of weeks it takes to save 80 toothpicks.

   \[
   \text{Time (weeks)} = \frac{\text{Number of toothpicks}}{\text{Rate of saving}} = \frac{80}{10} = 8 \text{ weeks}

Therefore, it will take Melanie an additional 8 weeks to collect enough toothpicks to complete her project. 

**The final answer is:** 8 weeks.<|im_end|>","Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.

                    A $2000 ; watch was put on . sale . so . that Mr. : Rogers . bought it at 75% of its original : price. He then sold the ! watch . to his ; friend at 120% of the price that he ! bought : it. What is the percentage , discount obtained by Mr. ? Roger's friend , from the original price?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend received, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
Mr. Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price.

- Original Price = $2000
- Discount Rate = 75%

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 - \text{Discount Rate}) \]

\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$2000 \times (1 - 0.75) \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$2000 \times 0.25 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $500 for the watch.

### Step 2: Calculate the selling price Mr. Rogers' friend received.
Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid for it.

- Mr. Rogers' Friend's Selling Price = \( \text{Discounted Price} \times (1 + \text{Selling Rate}) \)

\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$500 \times (1 + 1.20) \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$500 \times 2.20 \]
\[ \text{Selling Price} = \$1100 \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for $1100.

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the purchase price and the selling price.
This difference represents the amount saved by Mr. Rogers' friend.

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \$500 - \$1100 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -\$600 \]

Since this difference is negative, it indicates an overpayment rather than a discount. However, if we consider the absolute value, it is $600.

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount based on the original price.
The formula for percentage discount is:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting in our values:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{-600}{2000} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{-0.6}{1} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = -0.6 \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = -60\% \]

However, since the question asks for the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers’ friend, and considering the context of the problem where the friend’s friend is the seller, the calculation should be positive. Therefore, the correct interpretation would be that Mr. Rogers' friend made an overcharge, but let's re-evaluate the logic:

Given the initial misunderstanding in the problem statement, let's assume the friend sold the watch at 80% of what Mr. Rogers paid ($500).

- Mr. Rogers' Friend's Selling Price = \( \text{Discounted Price} \times (1 + \text{Selling Rate}) \)
- Mr. Rogers' Friend's Selling Price = \$500 \times (1 + 0.80)
- Mr. Rogers' Friend's Selling Price = \$500 \times 1.80
- Mr. Rogers' Friend's Selling Price = \$900

Now, calculate the difference again:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \$2000 - \$900 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$1100 \]

Thus, the correct interpretation is that the friend made a profit of $1100.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is -60%.<|im_end|>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.
He then sold it to his friend at $1500 x 120/100 = $<<1500*120/100=1800>>1800
So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish will be created over time based on the given conditions.

1. **Identify the rate of creation**: The problem states that every second, one new jellyfish is created. This means the number of jellyfish increases linearly with time.
2. **Determine the total time**: We need to find out how many seconds pass in 4 hours.
3. **Convert hours to seconds**: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert 4 hours into seconds as follows:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
   \]
4. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created**: Given that one jellyfish is created every second, the total number of jellyfish created in 14400 seconds is simply 14400. This is because the rate of creation is constant throughout the entire period.

Therefore, after 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created by all springs combined is \(14400\).

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{14400}
\]<|im_end|>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

To determine Frankie's score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between Frankie's and Binkie's scores:**
   - Frankie's score is ""better more! than twice"" as high as Binkie's.
   - Let \( F \) represent Frankie's score and \( B \) represent Binkie's score.

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - According to the statement, \( F = 3B + 1 \).

3. **Substitute Binkie's score into the equation:**
   - Given that Binkie's score \( B = 90 \), substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     F = 3(90) + 1
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication and addition:**
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 90 \):
     \[
     3 \times 90 = 270

To solve this problem, we need to break down James's journey into parts and calculate each segment.

1. **Identify the total distance**: The total distance between James's home and the store is 4 miles.
2. **Determine the first part of the journey**:
   - James walked halfway to the store.
   - Halfway means \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) miles.
3. **Calculate time for the first part**:
   - Speed: 4 miles/hour
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Time = \( \text{Distance} / \text{Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

   - Time = \( \text{Distance} / \text{Speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \).

6. **Total time calculation**:
   - Total time = Time for first part + Time for second part

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to compare the total cost of buying bananas individually versus buying them in bunches. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost if bought individually
First, let's determine how many bananas Jenny would buy individually if she bought 10 bunches.

- Each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
- Therefore, 10 bunches contain \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.

Next, calculate the cost per banana:

- The bananas cost $0.80 each.
- So, the cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = \$32.00\).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if bought in bunches
Now, let's consider the alternative method where Jenny buys bananas in bunches.

- She buys 10 bunches for a total of $3.00.
- This means she pays $0.30 per bunch because \(3.00 / 10 = \$0.30\).

Since each bunch contains 4 bananas, the number of bunches she gets from these bananas is \(40 / 4 = 10\) bunches.

So, her total cost remains $3.00 regardless of whether she buys them individually or in bunches.

### Step 3: Compare the costs
We now compare the two scenarios:

- Buying bananas individually: $32.00
- Buying bananas in bunches: $3.00

### Step 4: Determine savings
Finally, we find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Individual Cost} - \text{Bunches Cost} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$32.00 - \$3.00 = \$29.00 \]

Therefore, Jenny saved **\$29.00** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.<|im_end|>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent the length of the fence that Sam gets.
Let \( H \) represent the length of the fence that Harry gets.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know from the problem statement that:
- The total length of the fence is 100 feet.
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.
- Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[ S + H = 100 \]
And also,
\[ H = S + 60 \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve for One Variable
Substitute \( H \) in the first equation with \( S + 60 \):
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

### Step 4: Calculate Harry’s Share
Now, substitute \( S \) back into the equation \( H = S + 60 \):
\[ H = 20 + 60 \]
\[ H = 80 \]

So, Harry gets 80 feet of the fence.

### Step 5: Determine How Much Is Left Over for Sam
Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet, subtract the amount given to Sam from the total:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Thus, there are **80** feet of the fence left for Sam.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{80}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.

Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the growth rate of the crocodile and then use that rate to find out how much it will grow over a longer period.

Step 1: Calculate the average annual growth.
- The crocodile grows 8 inches over 4 years.
- To find the average annual growth, divide the total growth by the number of years:
\[ \text{Average Annual Growth} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Step 2: Determine the total growth over 13 years using the average annual growth.
- Now that we know the crocodile grows at an average rate of 2 inches per year, we can calculate its growth over 13 years:
\[ \text{Total Growth Over 13 Years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} \]
\[ \text{Total Growth Over 13 Years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

<|im_start|>system
To calculate how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
- Total bikes sold in a month = 300
- Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = \( 0.5 \times 300 = 150 \)
- Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = \( 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \)
- Number of MTB bikes sold = Remaining bikes after subtracting those of other types
    - Total bikes sold = 150 (Trekking) + 45 (BMX) = 195
    - Therefore, number of MTB bikes sold = 300 - 195 = 105

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue for each type of bike based on their prices.
- Price of one Trekking bike = $450
- Revenue from Trekking bikes = \( 150 \times 450 = \$67,500 \)

- Price of one BMX bike = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 500 = \$250 \)
- Revenue from BMX bikes = \( 45 \times 250 = \$11,250 \)

- Price of one MTB bike = $500
- Revenue from MTB bikes = \( 105 \times 500 = \$52,500 \)

### Step 3: Sum up all revenues to find out how much Marcel earned.
- Total revenue = \( 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = \$131,250 \)

Therefore, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $131,250.<|im_end|>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.

                    : There are 6 periods , in the day for a , normal student but John has to take 2 extra ! classes.  . Each class ! is 40 minutes . long.  . He ; goes to ? class for 5 days ; a week.  , He then spends 1/16 . of his weekly minutes each on , Saturday and Sunday : as , extra learning time. .  How many : hours a week does : he spend learning?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total minutes spent per class
Each class is 40 minutes long.

### Step 2: Calculate total minutes spent at school per day
There are 6 periods in a day.
John takes 2 additional classes, so he attends \(6 + 2 = 8\) classes per day.

### Step 3: Calculate total minutes spent at school per week
Since there are 7 days in a week:
\[ \text{Total minutes per week} = \text{Minutes per class} \times \text{Number of classes per day} \times \text{Days per week} \]
\[ \text{Total minutes per week} = 40 \times 8 \times 7 \]

### Step 4: Convert total minutes per week to hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = \frac{\text{Total minutes per week}}{60} \]

Let's perform these calculations now:

### Calculation:
\[ \text{Total minutes per week} = 40 \times 8 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes per week} = 40 \times 56 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes per week} = 2240 \]

### Conversion:
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = \frac{2240}{60} \]
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = \frac{2240}{60} \approx 37.33 \]

So, John spends approximately **37.33** hours per week learning.<|im_end|>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class

That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

                    question:
                    Nathan , has a bouncy : ball that bounces to 2/3rds of , its : starting , height with each ! bounce. If . he drops it from the third-floor balcony . in the : mall, where each story is 24 feet , high, how high ; does the ball go on ? its second ! bounce?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the ball after two bounces. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the height after the first bounce
- The initial height of the ball when dropped from the top floor (third floor) is \( h \).
- After the first bounce, the ball reaches \( \frac{2}{3}h \).

### Step 2: Calculate the height after the second bounce
- After the first bounce, the ball rebounds back to \( \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}h = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 h \).
- This means the ball reaches \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 h \) after the second bounce.

Now let's calculate these values:

1. **Initial height**: \( h \)
2. **Height after the first bounce**: \( \frac{2}{3}h \)

Next, for the second bounce:

1. **Height after the second bounce**:
   - We know the total distance traveled is twice the height of one bounce because there are two bounces.
   - So, if the ball goes up to \( \frac{2}{3}h \) and then comes back down to the same height, the total distance covered during the second bounce is \( \frac{2}{3}h + \frac{2}{3}h = \frac{4}{3}h \).

Since each story is 24 feet high, we can find out how many stories are in the mall:

\[ \text{Number of stories} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Height per story}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{24 \text{ feet/story}} = 1 \text{ story} \]

This means the ball travels up to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total height of the third floor (which is 24 feet), so:

\[ \text{Height after the second bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet

Then multiply that number by 2/3rds to find the height of the ball after two bounces: 48 feet * 2/3 = <<48*2/3=32>>32 feet

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the height of the first child:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.

2. **Calculate the height of the second child:**
   - The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
     \[
     \text{Height of second child} = 6 \, \text{feet} + 2 \, \text{inches}
     \]
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the first child’s height to inches for easier calculation:
     \[
     6 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{inches/foot} = 72 \, \text{inches}
     \]
     So, the second child is:
     \[
     72 \, \text{inches} + 2 \, \text{inches} = 74 \, \text{inches}
     \]

3. **Determine the height of the third child:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
     \[
     \text{Height of third child} = 74 \, \text{inches} - 5 \, \text{inches}
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     74 \, \text{inches} - 5 \, \text{inches} = 69 \, \text{inches}
     \]

4. **Find the height of the fourth child:**
   - The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
     \[
     \text{Height of fourth child} = 69 \, \text{inches} + 3 \, \text{inches}
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     69 \, \text{inches} + 3 \, \text{inches} = 72 \, \text{inches}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many bags were sold.
2. Calculate the total earnings based on the number of bags sold.

Step 1: Determine how many bags were sold.
- We know that there are two types of bags sold: 10-bag bags and smaller bags (we don't have information about these).
- Let's assume all the bags sold are 10-bag bags since no other type was mentioned.
- If the total number of apples sold is 2000, then the total number of 10-bag bags sold would be \( \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \) bags.

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.
- Each bag is sold for $5.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much meat was left after the T-rex ate its portion from the triceratops and then account for the scavenging by the velociraptors.

1. **Identify the total amount of meat eaten by the T-rex:**
   The T-rex ate half of the triceratops' meat. Let's denote the total amount of meat in the triceratops as \( M \). Therefore, the T-rex ate \( \frac{M}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the remaining meat after the T-rex ate its share:**
   After the T-rex ate its share, there is \( \frac{M}{2} \) kilograms of meat left.

3. **Determine the amount of meat left after the velociraptors scavenged:**
   The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left. So, they took away \( \frac{\frac{M}{2}}{2} = \frac{M}{4} \).

4. **Calculate the remaining meat after the velociraptors scavenged:**
   After the velociraptors scavenged, the remaining meat is \( \frac{M}{2} - \frac{M}{4} = \frac{M}{4} \).

5. **Account for the amount of meat eaten by the Allosaurus:**
   The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. This means that the remaining meat after the velociraptors scavenged is equal to the amount of meat the Allosaurus ate plus whatever was left after the T-rex and velociraptors ate their shares.

So, let's set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ \frac{M}{4} = 270 + \left( \frac{M}{2} - \frac{M}{4} \right) \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ \frac{M}{4} = 270 + \frac{M}{4} \]

Subtract \(\frac{M}{4}\) from both sides:

\[ 0 = 270 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 270 = 270 \]

Therefore, the total amount of meat in the triceratops before the T-rex ate was \( \boxed{540} \) kilograms.<|im_end|>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

                    Tony is ; painting a room with : four walls. The north ; and south . walls are ? 10 x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 ? feet. A gallon of ; paint ? can cover ; 20 . square , feet and cost : $12. How , much will : it cost to paint the room?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall.
- **North-South Walls (4 walls):**
  - Length = 10 ft
  - Width = 8 ft
  - Area of one wall = Length × Width
  - Total area for all North-South walls = Number of walls × Area of one wall
    \[
    4 \times (10 \text{ ft} \times 8 \text{ ft}) = 320 \text{ sq ft}
    \]

- **East-West Walls (2 walls):**
  - Length = 5 ft
  - Width = 8 ft
  - Area of one wall = Length × Width
  - Total area for all East-West walls = Number of walls × Area of one wall
    \[
    2 \times (5 \text{ ft} \times 8 \text{ ft}) = 80 \text{ sq ft}
    \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total area that needs to be painted.
\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of North-South walls} + \text{Area of East-West walls}
\]
\[
\text{Total area} = 320 \text{ sq ft} + 80 \text{ sq ft} = 400 \text{ sq ft}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
- Each gallon covers 20 sq ft.
- Number of gallons required = Total area ÷ Coverage per gallon
    \[
    \frac{400 \text{ sq ft}}{20 \text{ sq ft/gallon}} = 20 \text{ gallons}
    \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
- Cost per gallon = $12
- Total number of gallons needed = 20
- Total cost = Number of gallons × Cost per gallon
    \[
    \text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ gallons} \times \$12/\text{gallon} = \$240
    \]

### Final Answer:
It will cost Tony $\boxed{240}$ to paint the room.<|im_end|>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80

To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow each step:

1. **Initial number of sodas**:
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.

2. **Shaking process**:
   - Ellen shakes 3 sodas.
   - After shaking, there are 9 sodas (since 12 - 3 = 9).

3. **Ellen takes one unshaken soda**:
   - Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda.
   - Now, there are 8 sodas remaining in total.

4. **Ellen's brother takes a shaken soda and two unshaken sodas**:
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda.
   - Ellen's brother also takes 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves: 7 sodas (1 shaken + 2 unshaken) for Ellen and 5 sodas (6 shaken + 1 unshaken) for Ellen's brother.

5. **Ellen's friend comes along**:
   - Ellen's friend now has access to all 12 sodas.

6. **Probability calculation**:
   - We need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend picks a soda from the shaken can.
   - The probability of picking a soda from the shaken can is the ratio of the number of sodas in the shaken can to the total number of sodas.
   - Number of sodas in the shaken can = 1
   - Total number of sodas = 12
   - Probability = \(\frac{1}{12}\)

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from the shaken can is \(\frac{1}{12}\), which expressed as a percentage is \(8.33\%\). 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}
\]<|im_end|>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.

Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25

To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance between the two trains after 3 hours. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half that speed, so its speed is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by each train in 3 hours:**
   - For the first train (60 mph):
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - For the second train (30 mph):
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Since both trains are moving in opposite directions, their distances add up:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance Apart} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \, \text{miles} + 90 \, \text{miles} = 270 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains will be 270 miles apart. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 270 miles.<|im_end|>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.

This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

### Step 1: Calculate total working hours in March
- There are 31 days in March.
- Billy works every day except for two days.

\[ \text{Total working days} = 31 - 2 = 29 \]

### Step 2: Calculate total hours worked in March
- Billy works for 3 hours each day.

- Total days minus those off.

\[ \text{Total working days excluding off} = 29 - 6 = 23 \]

### Step 6: Calculate total hours worked in the remaining period
- Working hours per day.

\[ \text{Hours per working day} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Total working hours} = 23 \times 3 = 69 \]

### Step 7: Calculate total number of people helped in the remaining period
- Number of people helped per hour.

\[ \text{People helped per hour} = 2 \]
\[ \text{Total people helped} = 69 \times 2 = 138 \]

### Final Answer:
Billy helps **138** people during the given period.<|im_end|>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days
Then subtract the percentage of time Billy takes off from 100% to find the percentage of time he works: 100% - 20% = 80%
Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

To determine how many people were inside the church, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of vehicles**:
   - Private cars: 20
   - Buses: 12
   
   Total number of vehicles = 20 + 12 = 32 vehicles

2. **Number of people per vehicle**:
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - Each car carries 3 people.

3. **Calculate total passengers in buses**:
   Number of buses × Number of passengers per bus = 
   12 buses × 35 people/bus = 420 people

4. **Calculate total passengers in cars**:
   Number of cars × Number of passengers per car =
   20 cars × 3 people/car = 60 people

5. **Sum up all passengers**:
   Total passengers from buses + Total passengers from cars = 
   420 people (from buses) + 60 people (from cars) = 480 people

Therefore, there were **480 people** inside the church after the ceremony.<|im_end|>","There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.

To determine Jeff's age, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine Martha's age.
- We know that Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.
- Mike is 24 years old.

So, Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4 = 20 years old.

Step 2: Determine Jeff's age based on the information given in the problem.
- The problem states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to slide down their respective slides.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to slide on the biggest waterslide
- Length of the biggest waterslide = 300 feet
- Speed of sliding down the biggest waterslide = 60 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{biggest}}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to slide on the second biggest waterslide
- Length of the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet
- Speed of sliding down the second biggest waterslide = 80 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second-biggest}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{second-biggest}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{second-biggest}}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second-biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second-biggest}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in time between the two slides
Difference in time = Time_{biggest} - Time_{second-biggest}
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Difference in time} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes **2 minutes** longer to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest slide.<|im_end|>","First find the ride length of the biggest slide: 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = <<300/60=5>>5 minutes
Then find the ride length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = <<240/80=3>>3 minutes
Then subtract the ride length of the second longest slide from the longest slide to find the difference: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = <<5-3=2>>2 minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time for one lunch break.
- Each lunch break lasts 21 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time for one workday.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.
- A workday consists of 5 work periods (assuming he works 8-hour days).

\[ \text{Total time for one workday} = 5 \times 21 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes lunch break} \]

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ 5 \times 21 = 105 \]
\[ 105 + 30 = 135 \text{ minutes} \]

So, one full workday totals 135 minutes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time for 5 workdays.
- Multiply the total time for one workday by 5.

\[ \text{Total time for 5 workdays} = 135 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 135 \times 5 = 675 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour.

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{675}{60} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \frac{675}{60} = 11.25 \text{ hours} \]

### Conclusion:
After 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to **11.25 hours**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11.25}
\]<|im_end|>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes
He also has a 30-minute lunch every day so together with his 30-minute break he has a 30+30 = 60-minute break each day
Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Ahito ran given that the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles, and that Amber ran 8 miles.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Total distance run by all three runners = 52 miles
   - Distance run by Amber = 8 miles

2. **Calculate the remaining distance for Micah and Ahito combined:**
   \[
   \text{Distance run by Micah} + \text{Distance run by Ahito} = 52 - 8 = 44 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the relationship between Micah's and Ahito's distances:**
   - It is stated that Micah ran 3.5 times as much as Amber.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of miles Ahito ran.

4. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   \[
   \text{Distance run by Micah} = 3.5 \times \text{Distance run by Amber}
   \]
   Since Amber ran 8 miles, we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Distance run by Micah} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Substitute the known values back into the total distance equation:**
   \[
   28 + x = 44
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 44 - 28 = 16

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles.

**Final Answer:**

\[

To determine Sheila's new balance on her credit card after all transactions, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial charge
Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

### Step 2: Subtract the refunded item
She returned an item that cost $15.00.
- New total before any discounts or additional charges = $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

### Step 3: Apply the discount on the frying pan
The frying pan was on sale at 20% off.
- Discount amount on the frying pan = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00
- Final price of the frying pan = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00

### Step 4: Add the price of the frying pan to the remaining balance
New total after adding the frying pan purchase = $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00

### Step 5: Apply the additional discount on the towel set
The towel set was on sale at 10% off.
- Discount amount on the towel set = 10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00
- Final price of the towel set = $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00

### Step 6: Add the price of the towel set to the current total
Final total balance on her credit card = $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

### Conclusion
The new balance on Sheila's credit card is **$113.00**.<|im_end|>","She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance

   Let \( N \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

2. **Determine the Number of Large Jellyfish:**
   According to the problem, a fifth (i.e., one-fifth) of all jellyfish are large.
   Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is:
   \[

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work before she can retire, we'll break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate Lauren's savings rate:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck.

2. **Determine Lauren's total savings needed for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to save for 20 years, with an annual retirement income of 40% of her current salary.

3. **Find out how much Lauren needs to save per year to achieve this goal:**

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate Lauren's savings rate
Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck. Therefore, her savings rate is:
\[ \text{Savings Rate} = 20\% = 0.20 \]

### Step 2: Determine Lauren's total savings needed for retirement
Lauren plans to save for 20 years, with an annual retirement income of 40% of her current salary. Her current annual salary is $100,000.

First, calculate the annual retirement income:
\[ \text{Annual Retirement Income} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

Next, calculate the total retirement savings required over 20 years:
\[ \text{Total Savings Required} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \]

So, Lauren needs to save $800,000 in total over 20 years.

### Step 3: Find out how much Lauren needs to save per year to achieve this goal
Since Lauren saves at a rate of 20%, we can use the following formula to find out how many years it will take her to reach her goal:
\[ \text{Years Needed} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Required}}{\text{Annual Savings}} \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Years Needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$100,000 \times 0.20} \]
\[ \text{Years Needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} \]
\[ \text{Years Needed} = 40 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to reach her savings goal.

**Final Answer:** Lauren needs to work for **40 more years** to reach her savings goal.<|im_end|>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine how much ribbon is needed for one part**
- Marty has a total of 100 cm of ribbon.
- He needs to divide this ribbon into 4 equal parts.
- To find out the length of each part, we divide the total length by the number of parts:
\[ \text{Length per part} = \frac{\text{Total Length}}{\text{Number of Parts}} \]
\[ \text{Length per part} = \frac{100}{4} \]
\[ \text{Length per part} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

So, each part will be 25 cm long.

**Step 2: Determine how many smaller pieces can be made from each part**
- Each part is further divided into 5 equal smaller pieces.
- To find out the length of each smaller piece, we divide the length of each part by the number of smaller pieces:
\[ \text{Length of each smaller piece} = \frac{\text{Length per part}}{\text{Number of Smaller Pieces}} \]
\[ \text{Length of each smaller piece} = \frac{25}{5} \]
\[ \text{Length of each smaller piece} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, each smaller piece will be 5 cm long.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:**  
Each final cut will be **5 cm long**.<|im_end|>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm
From each piece of 25 cm, he gets 5 equal parts of 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5 cm each.

                    How , many : girls are in the school if . 40% of a ? school population is ; made up of 240 boys?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the school first, then find out how many girls there are based on the given percentage.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.
Given that 40% of the school's population consists of boys, and there are 240 boys, we can set up an equation to find the total number of students (let's call it \( S \)):

\[ 0.40 \times S = 240 \]

Solve for \( S \):

\[ S = \frac{240}{0.40} \]
\[ S = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of girls.
We know that 60% of the school population is girls because the remaining percentage must be girls. We can express the number of girls as follows:

Let \( G \) represent the number of girls. Then,

\[ G = 0.60 \times S \]

Substitute the value of \( S \) from Step 1 into the equation:

\[ G = 0.60 \times 600 \]
\[ G = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 360}}
\]<|im_end|>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.
Since 40% is equal to 240 students, then 1% is equal to 240/40 = <<240/40=6>>6 students.
Hence, there are 60 x 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 girls.

- Cost of the pots: $19
- Cost of the garden soil: $26
Total cost = $19 + $26 = $45

Step 2: Apply the coupon.
- Coupon value: $7

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party.

1. **Identify the total number of women:**
   - There are three women wearing 4-inch heels.
   - There are also three women wearing 2-inch heels.

   Therefore, there are \(3 + 3 = 6\) women in total.

2. **Calculate the total height of all the heels:**
   - Each woman wearing 4-inch heels contributes 4 inches to the total.
     \[
     4 \text{ inches/heel} \times 3 \text{ women} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Each woman wearing 2-inch heels contributes 2 inches to the total.
     \[
     2 \text{ inches/heel} \times 3 \text{ women} = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

   Adding these together gives us the total height of all the heels:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average height of the heels:**
   - To find the average height, divide the total height by the number of women (which is 6).
     \[
     \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ women}} = 3 \text{ inches per heel}
     \]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at this party is 3 inches. 

**The final answer is:** The average height of heels at this party is 3 inches.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches

                    Although Soledad works in a windowless : office, she loves : the ! outdoors. . She ! will . be on . vacation . for ! the . entire month , of June and cannot wait to hike . 9,300 miles within that : month. She is thinking of walking . twice a day, covering 125 miles each : time. How many more miles ; per day must Soledad hike to ? complete her journey . on time?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance Soledad needs to cover.
Soledad plans to walk 9,300 miles over an entire month.

### Step 2: Calculate how much distance Soledad covers per day if she walks twice a day.
If Soledad hikes twice a day, then each day she covers:
\[ \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{2} = 4,650 \text{ miles/day} \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many days Soledad has until her trip starts.
Since she is planning her vacation for the entire month of June (which typically has about 30-31 days), we'll assume a typical month length of 30 days.

### Step 4: Determine the number of days left in June after subtracting her planned vacation days.
Assuming she wants to spend at least 10 days on vacation:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ days remaining in June} \]

### Step 5: Calculate how many days Soledad can hike given her daily coverage rate.
Given that she can hike 4,650 miles per day, we need to determine how many such days fit into her available hiking time:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ days}}{4,650 \text{ miles/day}} \approx 0.00437 \text{ days} \]
This result indicates that she would only have approximately 0.00437 days left for hiking even if she hiked every day for 20 days.

### Step 6: Determine how many additional miles Soledad needs to cover to reach her goal.
Since she can't use any additional days because she won't be able to find enough suitable hiking spots during her limited vacation period, she doesn't need to hike any additional miles to finish her journey on time.

### Conclusion:
Soledad does not need to hike any additional miles to complete her journey on time.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is.<|im_end|>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day

To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day

To determine how much money the store will receive from selling all the balls, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balls.
2. Determine the revenue from each color based on their respective costs.
3. Sum up the revenues from all colors.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of balls**

- Red balls: 3
- Blue balls: 11
- Green balls: 25

Total number of balls = 3 (red) + 11 (blue) + 25 (green) = **49 balls**

**Step 2: Determine the revenue for each color**

- Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls × Price per red ball
\[ \text{Revenue from red} = 3 \times \$9 = \$27 \]

- Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls × Price per blue ball
\[ \text{Revenue from blue} = 11 \times \$5 = \$55 \]

- Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls × Price per green ball
\[ \text{Revenue from green} = 25 \times \$3 = \$75 \]

**Step 3: Sum up the revenues from all colors**

Total revenue = Revenue from red + Revenue from blue + Revenue from green
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$27 + \$55 + \$75 = \$157 \]

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold. 

{The final answer is} The final answer is $157.<|im_end|>","For the red balls, 3 balls * $9/ball = $<<3*9=27>>27.
For the blue balls, 11 balls * $5/ball = $<<11*5=55>>55.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much Pierre (Peter) wants.
Pierre wants a quarter of the total amount of apples.

Total amount of apples = 12 kg
Amount Pierre wants = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \)

\[
\text{Amount Pierre wants} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much Paul wants.
Paul wants one-third of what Pierre has.

Amount Pierre has = 3 kg
Amount Paul wants = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \)

\[
\text{Amount Paul wants} = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of apples after Pierre and Paul have taken their shares.
Total amount of apples = 12 kg
Amount Pierre wants = 3 kg
Amount Paul wants = 1 kg

Remaining amount after Pierre and Paul take their share:

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 12 - 3 - 1 = 8 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much James has left.
James originally had no information about his share in this scenario. Since there was only Pierre and Paul involved in the initial distribution, we assume that none of them took any from James. Therefore, James would still have all the apples he initially had.

Since the problem does not specify how much James started with or if he received anything, we cannot determine exactly how much James has left without additional information.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the steps above, it seems there might be an error in the setup of the problem as presented. If James did not participate in the distribution at all, then he would retain all 12 kg of apples. However, since the problem specifies that they wanted ""a quarter"" and ""one-third,"" it suggests that James must have been involved, but we don't have enough information to determine his specific contribution or the remainder after his potential claim. 

If we were to conclude based on the given data and assumptions, we could say that James has **0 kg** left, assuming he didn't participate in the distribution at all.

However, since the problem doesn't provide sufficient information to determine James' participation or exact distribution, the most accurate conclusion based on the provided data is:

\[
\boxed{\text{James has } 0 \text{ kg left}}
\]<|im_end|>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.
Together, Peter and Paul want a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.
So James will have 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 kg.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books Anna wants to buy.
Anna has a budget of $16, but she only spent $4 so far. We know that she bought 2 books today.

Total amount spent = Budget - Remaining budget
Remaining budget = $16 - $4 = $12

Since Anna spent $4 on 2 books, we can calculate the price per book:
Price per book = Total amount spent / Number of books
Price per book = $4 / 2 = $2

Now, since Anna bought two books, each book costs $2.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget after buying the books.
After spending $4 on 2 books, Anna still has $2 left in her budget.

### Conclusion:
Each book costs $2.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

   - According to the information provided, last year there were 50 students enrolled.

2. **Calculate the percentage increase for this year:**
   - The problem states that there was a 20% increase from last year.
   - To find out how many students this represents, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students from last year.

3. **Perform the calculation for the increase:**
   - Number of students last year = 50
   - Increase = 20% of 50
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

4. **Add the increase to the original number of students:**
   - Total number of students this year = Number of students last year + Increase
   \[
   \text{Total number of students this year} = 50 + 10 = 60

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the frequency of blinking:**
   - We know that the light blinks 255 times every 5 minutes.

2. **Calculate the number of blinks per minute:**
   - To find out how many times the light blinks in one minute, we divide the total number of blinks by the total time (in minutes):
     \[
     \text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255}{5}
     \]
   
3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{255}{5} = 51
   \]

So, the light blinks 51 times every minute.

4. **Calculate the total time for 459 blinks:**
   - Now that we know the light blinks 51 times per minute, we can determine how long it takes to blink 459 times by dividing the desired number of blinks by the rate at which they occur.
     \[
     \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459}{51}
     \]

5. **Perform the division again:**
   \[
   \frac{459}{51} = 9
   \]

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

**Final Answer:** It will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.<|im_end|>","The lighthouse blinks 255 / 5 = <<255/5=51>>51 times per minute.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more female fish (guppies and goldfish) Tate has compared to male fish in his garden pond.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Count the initial number of male and female guppies.
- Initial number of male guppies = 4
- Initial number of female guppies = 7

### Step 2: Update the numbers after buying new guppies.
- Number of male guppies after buying = 4 + 2 = 6
- Number of female guppies after buying = 7 + 1 = 8

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of male and female guppies now.
- Total number of male guppies = 6
- Total number of female guppies = 8

### Step 4: Calculate the difference between the number of male and female guppies.
- Difference = 8 - 6 = 2

So, Tate currently has **2 more female guppies** than male guppies.

### Step 5: Determine the number of male and female goldfishes initially and after purchasing additional ones.
- Initial number of male goldfishes = 3
- Initial number of female goldfishes = 5

### Step 6: Update the numbers after buying additional goldfishes.
- Number of male goldfishes after buying = 3 + 2 = 5
- Number of female goldfishes after buying = 5 + 3 = 8

### Step 7: Calculate the total number of male and female goldfishes now.
- Total number of male goldfishes = 5
- Total number of female goldfishes = 8

### Step 8: Calculate the difference between the number of male and female goldfishes.
- Difference = 8 - 5 = 3

So, Tate currently has **3 more female goldfishes** than male goldfishes.

### Final Answer
Tate has **2 more female guppies** and **3 more female goldfishes** than male guppies and goldfishes respectively. Therefore, he has **5 more female fish** in total compared to male fish. 

{The final answer is} 5<|im_end|>","Tate has a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.

<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing values in the sentences for each person based on the given information and then calculate the total time taken by everyone.

1. **Amalia**'s work: Mowing the lawn (which takes 4 hours)
2. **Megan**: Walking the dog (which takes 2 hours longer than Amalia)
3. **Dior**: Doing laundry (which takes well over 4 hours longer than Amalia)

First, let's find out how long it took Megan:

- Amalia's time = 4 hours
- Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours = 4 + 2 = 6 hours

Next, let's determine how long it took Dior:

- Amalia's time = 4 hours
- Dior's time > 4 hours more than Amalia's time
- Let’s assume Dior's time is x hours where x > 4

Now, let's calculate the total time they all took together:

- Amalia's time = 4 hours
- Megan's time = 6 hours
- Dior's time = x hours (where x > 4)

Total time = 4 + 6 + x

Since Dior's time is more than 4 hours but less than 8 hours, let's consider the simplest case where Dior took exactly 5 hours as an example:

- If Dior took 5 hours,
  - Total time = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15 hours

Let's verify if this fits within the constraints:
- Amalia's time is 4 hours
- Megan's time is 6 hours
- Dior's time is 5 hours, which is indeed more than 4 hours but not over 8 hours.

Thus, our assumption holds true.

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \boxed{15} hours.<|im_end|>","Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to do her work, a total of 4+2 = 6 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the time spent driving:**
   - The problem states that it takes John 2 hours to drive there.
   - Therefore, for the return journey (the same distance), it will also take him 2 hours.

2. **Calculate the total time spent on trips in one visit:**
   - Since John makes two trips per month, we need to add up the time for both journeys.
   - Time for first trip + Time for second trip = Total time spent on trips per visit
   - 2 hours (first trip) + 2 hours (second trip) = 4 hours

3. **Convert the total time from hours to minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - 4 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes

4. **Calculate the average speed using the formula:**
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   - Rearrange the formula to find Distance: 
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Given that John drives at a speed of 70 mph during the trip, we can substitute the values here.
   - Distance = 70 mph × 240 minutes

5. **Perform the multiplication to get the distance:**
   - 70 mph × 240 minutes = 16800 miles

Therefore, considering the round trip, John drives approximately **16800 miles** a month when visiting his parents.<|im_end|>","His parents live 70*2=<<70*2=140>>140 miles away

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how much distance Sofie walks in one day.
- We know that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.
- Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles per day, we need to find out her total walking distance over 7 days.
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 3: Determine how much distance Brian walks in one day.
- Since Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can deduce that Brian walks half the distance Sofie does in one day.
\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in one day} = \frac{\text{Sofie's daily distance}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in one day} = \frac{10}{2} \]
\[ \text{Distance Brian walks in one day} = 5 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance Brian walks in 7 days.
- Now that we know Brian walks 5 miles per day, we can calculate his total walking distance over 7 days.
\[ \text{Total distance Brian walks} = 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance Brian walks} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

                    question:
                    A ? toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. : 5 workers : are available ; to ; work on the order. 2 , of the workers ? produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers ? produce 4 ? toys an : hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many toys each worker produces per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine total production required:**
   - The order requires 400 toys.
   - After working for 10 hours, they have produced enough toys to fulfill the remaining 20 toys.

2. **Calculate the number of toys already produced:**
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour.
   - Therefore, in one hour, two workers together can produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys.
   
3. **Set up an equation to find out how much more needs to be produced after the first 10 hours:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of hours the remaining three workers (the ones who produce 4 toys per hour) work.
   - In those \( x \) hours, the remaining three workers will produce \(3 \times 4x = 12x\) toys.
   - This should equal the additional 20 toys needed.

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   12x = 20
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{12} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total production from the five workers over 10 hours:**
   - The second group of workers (\(2 + 2\)) works for 10 hours initially, producing \(2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
   - The third group of workers (\(2 + 2\)) also works for 10 hours, producing \(2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
   - Adding both groups' contributions:
     \[
     120 + 80 = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

6. **Determine the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - Since they must produce exactly 400 toys in total, the fifth worker must produce:
     \[
     400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

7. **Calculate the rate at which the fifth worker produces toys:**
   - The fifth worker works for 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker's production rate is:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 20 \text{ toys per hour}
     \]

**Final Answer:** 
The fifth worker produces \(\boxed{20}\) toys per hour.<|im_end|>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

1. **Determine the weight of Elijah's dog:**
   - We know that Elijah's dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
   - Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
   - Therefore, Elijah's dog weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \times 60 \) pounds.

3. **Determine the total weight of both dogs:**
   - Elijah's dog weighs 15 pounds.
   - Kory's dog also weighs 60 pounds (as given).
   - To find the total weight, we add these two weights together.

4. **Calculate the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Elijah's dog} + \text{Kory's dog} = 15 + 60 = 75 \text{ pounds}

1. **Identify the total number of stickers Seth had initially:**

   - Let \( S \) represent the total number of stickers Seth had.
   
2. **Seth gives half of his stickers to Luis:**
   - Seth gives away \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
   - After giving these stickers to Luis, Seth has \( S - \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{2} \) stickers left.

3. **Luis uses half of the stickers he receives from Seth:**
   - Luis uses \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
   - After using these stickers, Luis has \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers left.

4. **Luis gives the remaining stickers to Kris:**
   - Luis gives away \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers.
   - After giving these stickers to Kris, Luis has \( \frac{S}{4} - \frac{S}{4} = 0 \) stickers left (since all were given away).

5. **Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 stickers to Rob:**
   - Kris keeps 9 stickers.
   - The total stickers given to Rob is 7.
   - Therefore, Kris must have started with \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers before giving them away.

6. **Determine how many stickers Seth originally had:**
   - Since Kris received 7 stickers from Seth, Seth must have given away 7 stickers to Kris.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the large bags
First, we calculate the total weight of the three large bags.

- Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
- There are 3 large bags.

\[
\text{Total weight} = 3 \times 10 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of M&Ms per ounce
We know that there are 30 M&Ms in one ounce.

\[
\text{Number of M&Ms per ounce} = 30
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of M&Ms available
Now, we multiply the total weight (in ounces) by the number of M&Ms per ounce.

\[
\text{Total number of M&Ms} = 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many small bags John can fill
John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag.

\[
\text{Number of small bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of M&Ms}}{\text{M&Ms per small bag}} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, John can fill 90 small bags with 10 M&Ms each.

   - We need to find out how long it takes him to cover half the circumference of Earth.

2. **Calculate the circumference of the Earth:**
   - The circumference of Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.

3. **Find half of the Earth's circumference:**
   - Half of 40,000 kilometers is \( \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \) kilometers.

4. **Calculate the number of days it would take Alfie to fly half the Earth's circumference:**
   - Alfie flies 400 kilometers per day.
   - To find the number of days, divide the total distance (half the Earth's circumference) by his daily flight distance.
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Daily distance}} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}}
     \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{20,000}{400} = 50
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Half of 40,000 kilometers is 40,000/2=<<40000/2=20000>>20,000 kilometers.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how fast the ""faster"" car goes based on the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the given relationships**:
   - The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.
   - The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car (which is 120 miles per hour).

2. **Calculate the speed of the second fastest car**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of second fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times (\text{Speed of second fastest car})
   \]

4. **Substitute the known values into the equation**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times (5 \times 120 \text{ mph})
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph}
   \]
   
6. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine Liam's current age.
Liam is currently 16 years old.

Step 2: Calculate Liam's age two years ago.
Liam's age two years ago = 16 - 2 = 14 years.

Step 3: Let V represent Vince's current age.
Two years ago, Vince's age would have been (V - 2) years.

Step 4: According to the given information, Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age at that time.
So, we can set up an equation based on this relationship:
14 = 2 * ((V - 2))

Step 5: Solve for V.
First, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate (V - 2):
7 = V - 2

Add 2 to both sides to solve for V:
7 + 2 = V
9 = V

Therefore, Vince is 9 years old now.

The final answer is: The final answer is 9.<|im_end|>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and then combine our findings.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define some variables for easier calculations:

- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs that Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs that Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs that Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs that Sarah painted.

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ A + M = 56 \]
and
\[ C + S = 30 \]

Additionally, we have the information that Camden paints 12 more eggs than Sarah:
\[ C = S + 12 \]

### Step 2: Substitute and Solve Equations
First, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, using \( C = S + 12 \), we can find \( C \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

So, Camden painted 21 eggs.

Next, we use \( A + M = 56 \) and \( C = S + 12 \) to find \( A \) and \( M \). Since \( S = 9 \), \( C = 21 \):

From \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ 21 = 9 + 12 \]

This confirms our values for \( C \) and \( S \).

### Step 3: Calculate Total Eggs Painted by All Three Together
Now we add up all the eggs:
\[ A + B + C + D = 56 \]
where \( A + M = 56 \) and \( C + D = 30 \).

Since \( A + M = 56 \), if \( A = M \), then:
\[ A = M = \frac{56}{2} = 28 \]

Thus,
\[ A = 28 \quad \text{and} \quad M = 28 \]

And since \( C = 21 \) and \( S = 9 \),
\[ C + D = 30 \Rightarrow D = 30 - 21 = 9 \]

### Step 4: Find the Difference Between Camden’s Eggs and Arnold’s Eggs
Finally, calculate how many more eggs Camden painted compared to Arnold:
\[ \text{Difference} = C - A \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 21 - 28 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -7 \]

However, since the difference should be positive, we take the absolute value:
\[ | -7 | = 7 \]

Therefore, Camden painted **more** eggs than Arnold by **7 eggs**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{7}}
\]<|im_end|>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many boxes Nik needs
Nik has 200 crayons. Each box can hold 8 crayons.

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total number of crayons}}{\text{Crayons per box}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200}{8}
\]

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = 25
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the boxes
Each box weighs 8 ounces. There are 25 boxes.

\[
\text{Weight of one box (in ounces)} = 8 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of boxes (in ounces)} = 25 \times 8 \text{ ounces}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of boxes (in ounces)} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce. There are 200 crayons.

\[
\text{Total weight of crayons (in ounces)} = 200 \times 1 \text{ ounce}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight of crayons (in ounces)} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 4: Add the weights together
Now we add the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons:

\[
\text{Total weight (in ounces)} = 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} + 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight (in ounces)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds
There are 16 ounces in one pound.

\[
\text{Total weight (in pounds)} = \frac{\text{Total weight (in ounces)}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight (in pounds)} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight (in pounds)} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer
The total weight of the crayons and the boxes when there are 16 ounces in a pound is:

\[
\boxed{25 \text{ pounds}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many logs John gets from the original tree.
2. Calculate how many planks he gets from each log.
3. Compute his total revenue from selling all the planks.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Determine how many logs John gets from the original tree.
John can get logs from 80% of the tree. The tree is 80 feet tall, so we calculate the number of logs as follows:
\[ \text{Number of logs} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many planks he gets from each log.
Each log is cut into 4-foot sections. So, we divide the length of each log (which is 4 feet) by the size of each plank (also 4 feet):
\[ \text{Planks per log} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \]
Since there are 64 logs in total, the total number of planks will be:
\[ \text{Total planks} = 64 \times 1 = 64 \]

### Step 3: Compute his total revenue from selling all the planks.
He sells each plank for $1.2, so his total revenue is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 64 \times 1.2 = \$76.80 \]

Therefore, the amount John makes from selling all the planks is **$76.80**.<|im_end|>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.

So he makes 80*1.2=$<<80*1.2=96>>96.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate Valerie's Brother's Salary
Valerie earns $5000 per month. According to the problem, half of what she earns goes to her brother.
- Valerie's brother's salary = (1/2) * Valerie's monthly earnings
- Valerie's brother's salary = (1/2) * $5000 = $2500 per month

### Step 2: Calculate Their Mother's Monthly Earnings
Their mother earns twice as much as the combined salaries of Valerie and her brother.
- Combined monthly earnings of Valerie and her brother = Valerie's monthly earnings + Her brother's monthly earnings
- Combined monthly earnings = $5000 + $2500 = $7500
- Mother's monthly earnings = 2 * Combined monthly earnings
- Mother's monthly earnings = 2 * $7500 = $15000 per month

### Step 3: Calculate Total Money They All Have Together
- Total monthly earnings of Valerie, her brother, and their mother = Valerie's monthly earnings + Her brother's monthly earnings + Mother's monthly earnings
- Total monthly earnings = $5000 + $2500 + $15000 = $22500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total distance Grandma walks.
Grandma walks 3 miles every day. We don't need to know how many days or what else she does because we're only concerned with the time it takes to cover the 3 miles.

### Step 2: Identify the distances on the beach and sidewalk.
- Beach: 2 miles
- Sidewalk: 1 mile

### Step 3: Calculate the ratio of walking times on different surfaces.
Since Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, she will spend half as much time on the sidewalk as on the beach.

### Step 4: Determine the time spent on the beach.
If 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, then the time spent on the sidewalk would be half of that.

\[ \text{Time on beach} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{40}{2} \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the time per mile.
Since the total time is 60 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), we can determine the time per mile:

\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Total miles}} \]
\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 20 \text{ minutes/mile} \]

### Step 6: Verify the time spent on each surface.
- Time on the beach: \( 40 \text{ minutes} \)
- Time on the sidewalk: \( 20 \text{ minutes} \)

### Step 7: Confirm the total time to complete the walk.
We already calculated the time spent on both surfaces, so now we just add these together to get the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 20 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile walk. 

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.

To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

   - She has been saving for 8 weeks.
   - We need to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to save a total of $60.

2. **Calculate the total amount Jane has already saved:**
   - Since she saves $4 per week and has saved for 8 weeks,
     \[

3. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $60:**
   - The total amount she wants to save is $60.
   - Subtract the amount she has already saved ($32) from $60,

4. **Calculate how long it will take her to save the remaining $28 at her current rate:**
   - She saves $4 per week,
     \[
     \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$28}{\$4/\text{week}} = 7 \text{ weeks}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the current number of marbles Bob has**

Let \( x \) represent the number of marbles Bob currently has.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles after receiving additional ones**

Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles. Since one dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24.

So, if Bob has \( x \) marbles initially, adding 24 to that gives us \( x + 24 \).

**Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given information**

According to the problem, after receiving these additional marbles, Bob will have 60 marbles in total. Therefore,
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**

Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

Thus, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

**Step 5: Determine the number of marbles Bob will have after losing some**

If Bob loses 10 marbles, we need to subtract 10 from his current total:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have **26 marbles** remaining.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.

This means B = 60 - 24 = <<60-24=36>>36.
Bob ends with 36 - 10 = <<36-10=26>>26 marbles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Understanding the constraints:**
   - Donny can only drink water when its temperature is at least 40 degrees.
   - He has two mugs of water.

2. **Given information:**
   - Mug 1 (at 33 degrees) will be poured into the water bottle.
   - Mug 2 (unknown temperature) will also be poured into the water bottle.
   - After pouring, he drinks the mixture.

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the minimum possible temperature of Mug 2 so that he can drink the remaining mixture.

4. **Steps to solve:**
   - Since he must drink water at least at 40 degrees, we need to ensure that both the 33-degree mug and any portion from the other mug meet or exceed this threshold.
   - Pouring 4 ounces from Mug 1 (33 degrees) and 1 ounce from Mug 2 into the water bottle should result in the total volume being at least 40 degrees.

5. **Calculations:**
   - Let \( T_2 \) be the temperature of Mug 2.
     - From the 33-degree mug, 4 ounces would add \( 4 \times 33 = 132 \) degree to the mix.
     - Adding 1 ounce from Mug 2 adds \( T_2 \) degree to the mix.
     - Total volume is 5 ounces, so the sum of these temperatures must equal or exceed 40 degrees:
       \[
       132 + T_2 \geq 40
       \]

6. **Solving for \( T_2 \):**
   \[
   T_2 \geq 40 - 132
   \]
   \[
   T_2 \geq -92
   \]

Since the temperature cannot be negative, this calculation suggests that the temperature of Mug 2 must be greater than 40 degrees to ensure he can drink the mixture.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - To satisfy the condition where he can drink the mixture after pouring 4 ounces from Mug 1 and 1 ounce from Mug 2, the minimum possible temperature of Mug 2 must be greater than 40 degrees.

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Melanie's father starts with 50 cows.
   - He also has 20 chickens.

2. **Daily Contributions from Milkie Cows Limited**:
   - They bring in 20 cows per day.

3. **Daily Contributions from Broilers Limited**:
   - They bring in 10 chickens per day.

4. **Duration**:
   - The contributions last for three weeks (21 days).

5. **Calculating Total Animals After Three Weeks**:

   - **Cows Contribution**:
     - Over 21 days, they will add \(20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}\).
   
   - **Chickens Contribution**:
     - Over 21 days, they will add \(10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}\).

6. **Total Number of Animals**:
   - Initial number of animals: \(50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals}\).
   - Adding the cows and chickens over the three weeks:
     - Total cows: \(50 + 420 = 470\).
     - Total chickens: \(20 + 210 = 230\).
   
   - Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \(470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals}\).

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Each pack contains 9 bagels.

\[
4 \text{ packs} \times 9 \text{ bagels/pack} = 36 \text{ bagels}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost before any discount.
Russell orders 4 packs at $10.00 per pack.

\[
4 \text{ packs} \times \$10.00/\text{pack} = \$40.00
\]

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount.
A 10% discount means Russell pays only 90% of the original price.

\[
\$40.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$40.00 \times 0.90 = \$36.00

### Step 4: Determine the cost per single bagel after the discount.
After applying the discount, Russell gets 4 bagels for the discounted price of $36.00.

\[
\$36.00 / 4 \text{ bagels} = \$9.00 \text{ per bagel}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Gomer ate; 5 less than 23 scoops of something**.
   - This means Gomer ate \(23 - 5 = 18\) scoops.

2. **If it takes 3! less than 6 potatoes to make one less scoop of mashed potatoes**.
   - First, calculate ""3!"":
     \[
     3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
     \]
   - Then, subtract 1 from 6 to get the number of potatoes needed for one scoop:
     \[
     6 - 1 = 5
     \]
   - Since it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make one scoop, we need:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

3. **1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes**.
   - This means Gomer ate \(3 - 1 = 2\) scoops.

Now, combining these steps, we have:

- Gomer ate 18 scoops of something (which is actually 2 scoops of mashed potatoes).
- He needs 8 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.
- Therefore, he needs \(8 \times 2 = 16\) potatoes in total.

So, Gomer ate 16 potatoes.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: 16<|im_end|>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To determine how many dozen eggs Chester needs over 60 days, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs consumed in the first 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Over 30 days, he consumes \( 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs} \).

2. **Calculate the number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days (after increasing):**
   - After increasing his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Over the next 30 days, he consumes \( 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs} \).

3. **Total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:**
   - Adding both periods together, Chester consumes \( 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs} \).

4. **Convert the total number of eggs from eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in one dozen.
   - To find out how many dozens he needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.
   - So, \( \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens} \).

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Chester needs **20 dozen** eggs for 60 days.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 17 green jelly beans.
   - There are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones.
   - The rest of the jelly beans are blue.

2. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jelly beans}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of men and women initially on the bus**.
2. **Calculate the number of women who alight from the bus at the next stop**.
3. **Find out how many women remain on the bus after some leave**.

### Step 1: Determine the number of men and women initially on the bus

Given that the ratio of men to women is \(5:9\), let's denote the number of men as \(M\) and the number of women as \(W\).

From the ratio, we know:
\[ M = \frac{5}{14} \times W \]

We also know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, so:
\[ M + W = 84 \]

Substitute \(M\) in terms of \(W\) into the equation for the total number of passengers:
\[ \frac{5}{14}W + W = 84 \]

Combine the terms involving \(W\):
\[ \frac{5}{14}W + \frac{14}{14}W = 84 \]
\[ \frac{19}{14}W = 84 \]

Solve for \(W\):
\[ W = \frac{84 \times 14}{19} \]
\[ W = \frac{1176}{19} \]
\[ W = 61.368 \approx 61.37 \] (approximately)

Since the number of people must be an integer, let's check if 61 women fit within the total passenger count:
\[ M + 61 = 84 \]
\[ M = 84 - 61 \]
\[ M = 23 \]

So, there are 23 men and 61 women initially on the bus.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of women who alight from the bus at the next stop

It's given that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. So, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[ 61 - 20 = 41 \]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is 41.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{41}\).<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14

                    question:
                    Faraday owns a flower ; shop. He sells a ! sunflower that costs ; $2 each and a ! bouquet of ! sunflower that ! costs , $8. . If Faraday earned $26 from : the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, . and if each bouquet ! has 12 ! sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to sell : after , 3 ! days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in one day.
- **Sunflowers sold in one day** = Total earnings from sunflowers / Price per sunflower
  \[
  \text{Number of sunflowers} = \frac{\$26}{\$2}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Number of sunflowers} = 13
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of sunflowers sold over three days.
- **Total number of sunflowers sold over three days** = Number of sunflowers per day × Number of days
  \[
  \text{Total number of sunflowers} = 13 \times 3
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total number of sunflowers} = 39
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]<|im_end|>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.
And he was able to sell a total of $26/$2= <<26/2=13>>13 Sunflowers.
The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks.
Adam buys rocks at $5 each and sells them at $7 each.

- Number of rocks bought = $100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks
- Revenue from selling 20 rocks = 20 rocks * $7 per rock = $140

### Step 2: Determine the amount sold (60% of the total).
Adam sells 60% of his inventory.

- Amount sold = 20 rocks * 60% = 12 rocks

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the rocks.
Adam spends $5 on each rock and buys 20 rocks.

- Total cost = 20 rocks * $5 per rock = $100

### Step 4: Determine the profit or loss.
Profit or Loss = Revenue - Cost

- Profit/Loss = $140 (revenue) - $100 (cost) = $40

Since the result is positive ($40), Adam makes a profit of $40.

### Conclusion:
Adam makes a profit of $40 after investing all his money into the rock stand and selling 60% of his inventory.

Therefore, the final answer is that Adam does not lose any money; he actually gains $40.<|im_end|>","He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many days Lauren needs to complete the projects, we need to calculate the total number of pictures she needs to create and then divide that by the number of pictures she can produce in one day.

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures needed:**
   - Large-sized picture scenes: 45
   - Medium-sized picture scenes: 36
   - Small-sized picture scenes: 49

2. **Sum these values to find the total number of pictures:**
   \[
   \text{Total Pictures} = 45 + 36 + 49 = 130
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pictures Lauren can produce in one day:**
   - Large-sized: 5
   - Medium-sized: 6
   - Small-sized: 7

4. **Calculate the total number of pictures she can produce in one day:**
   \[
   \text{Pictures per Day} = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18
   \]

5. **Divide the total number of pictures by the number of pictures she can produce in one day to find the total number of days required:**
   \[
   \text{Days Required} = \frac{\text{Total Pictures}}{\text{Pictures per Day}} = \frac{130}{18}
   \]

6. **Perform the division to get the number of days:**
   \[
   \frac{130}{18} \approx 7.22
   \]

Since Lauren cannot work a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number because even if there is a remainder from working more than a full day, she still needs to complete the remaining pictures on the next day:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of eggs evenly among the four children.

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs:**
   - Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children:**
   - There are four children.
   - We need to find out how many eggs each child will get.

\[
\text{Number of eggs per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of children}}
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[
\text{Number of eggs per child} = \frac{36}{4}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Number of eggs per child} = 9
\]

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

To find the average speed Sid was traveling, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial average speed
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.

\[
\text{Initial Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{110 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}}
\]

\[
\text{Initial Average Speed} = 55 \text{ mph}

### Step 2: Determine the total distance traveled after Sid’s additional travel
Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

### Step 3: Find the total time traveled
Total time = Initial time + Additional time

\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled
Total Distance = Initial Distance + Additional Distance

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the average speed for the entire trip
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}}
\]

\[
\text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ mph}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the individual probabilities:**
   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% (or 0.2) chance of winning.
   - The second lottery ticket has a 3 times higher likelihood than the first, so it would have a 60% (or 0.6) chance of winning.

2. **Calculate the combined probability for both tickets winning together:**

Since the events are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities to find the combined probability that both tickets will win.

\[ P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 Wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 Wins}) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = 0.2 \times 0.6 \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ P(\text{Both Tickets Win}) = 0.12 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - We know that Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim's collection is 5 more than Carlos' collection.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
   - Therefore, \( C + 5 = 27 \).

2. **Solve for \( C \):**
   \[
   C + 5 = 27 \\
   C = 27 - 5 \\
   C = 22
   \]
   So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

3. **Determine how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Let \( Cr \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
   - Therefore, \( 2 \times Cr = 22 \).

4. **Solve for \( Cr \):**
   \[
   2 \times Cr = 22 \\
   Cr = \frac{22}{2} \\
   Cr = 11

   So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

5. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total seashells collected: 
     \[
     27 + 22 + 11 = 60
     \]

6. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three people:**
   - There are 3 people (Carlos, Jim, and Carrey).
   - Each person should receive an equal share.
   - Divide the total seashells by 3:
     \[
     \text{Seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in one week. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of carrots eaten per day
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- He eats 5 carrots each weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of carrots for weekdays
Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, we multiply the number of carrots eaten per weekday by the number of weekdays:

\[ \text{Total carrots per weekday} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, Mason eats 20 carrots each weekday.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots for weekends
There are 2 days in the weekend, so we multiply the number of carrots eaten per weekend day by the number of weekend days:

\[ \text{Total carrots per weekend} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

So, Mason eats 10 carrots each weekend.

### Step 4: Add the totals from weekdays and weekends
Now, we add the total number of carrots eaten during the weekdays and the total number of carrots eaten during the weekend:

\[ \text{Total carrots per week} = 20 \times 5 + 10 \times 2 \]

Calculate each term separately:

\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \]
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Add these together:

\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in one week is \( 120 \).

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the length of the second song:**
   - The first song is given as 5 minutes.
   - The second song is described to be 60% longer than the first song.

2. **Calculate the length of the second song:**
   - To find 60% of the first song (which is 5 minutes), we calculate \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) minutes.
   - Therefore, the second song is \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) minutes long.

3. **Calculate the total length of the cassette:**
   - We know there are two songs on the cassette.
   - The total length is the sum of both songs' lengths.
   - So, \( 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Identify the total cost and revenue from selling one mobile device:**
   - The initial cost (original price) of one mobile device is $20.
   - After selling one device, the profit made is double the original price, which means the profit is \(2 \times 20 = \$40\).

2. **Calculate the total profit from selling two devices last Monday:**
   - Last Monday, he sold 2 devices.
   - Profit from these sales would be \(2 \times 40 = \$80\).

3. **Calculate the total profit from selling four devices last Tuesday:**
   - Last Tuesday, he sold 4 devices.
   - Profit from these sales would be \(4 \times 40 = \$160\).

4. **Sum up the profits from both days:**
   - Total profit from selling the devices on both days is \(80 + 160 = \$240\).

5. **Determine the total amount spent on buying the devices:**
   - He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
   - Cost of one device is $20, so the total cost is \(2 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = \$120\).

6. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total profit minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = \(240 - 120 = \$120\).

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} $\boxed{120}$<|im_end|>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40
The total cost for the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80
The total cost of these devices is 80+40= <<80+40=120>>120
Linus sold each mobile device he bought for $20 x 2 = $<<20*2=40>>40.
So, he earned $40 x 2 = $<<40*2=80>>80 for the two devices he bought last Monday.
And he earned $40 x 4 = $<<40*4=160>>160 for the 4 devices he bought last Tuesday.
The total amount of sales he made were worth 160+80 =<<160+80=240>>240
Linus earned 240-120 =$<<240-120=120>>120

                    question:
                    Carl has a : cane that is half ; as long as he ; is tall.  Carl is one foot ! taller than ; his ; brother, Ned. ?  And ; Ned is two feet shorter , than his , cousin, Isabel.  If Isabel is 7 , feet ; tall, how long is ? Carl's cane, , in feet?

<|im_start|>system
To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Carl's height**:
   - Let \( C \) be Carl's height.
   - According to the information given, Carl is one foot taller than his brother, Ned. Therefore,
     \[
     C = N + 1 \quad \text{where} \quad N = \text{Ned's height}
     \]
   - We know Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, so:
     \[
     N = I - 2 \quad \text{where} \quad I = \text{Isabel's height}
     \]
   - Given Isabel is 7 feet tall:
     \[
     N = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate Carl's height**:
   - Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned:
     \[
     C = N + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the length of Carl's cane**:
   - The cane is half as long as Carl's height:
     \[
     \text{Cane Length} = \frac{C}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
     \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet.<|im_end|>","If Isabel is 7 feet tall, and Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, then Ned is 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 feet tall.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many more bottles of juices Hortex need to produce to meet the daily energy demands of 2300 people, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles needed to meet the energy requirements for 2300 people.

Each person's daily energy demand is covered by \( \frac{1}{5} \) (since 20% of one person’s daily energy demand is covered by one bottle).

So, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \times \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \times \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = 2300 \div 5 = 460 \]

This means that Hortex currently produces enough juice to cover the energy needs of only 460 people per day.

### Step 2: Determine how many additional bottles are needed to meet the full demand.

Since the current production meets the needs of only 460 people, the remaining number of people who still require juice is:
\[ \text{Remaining people needing juice} = 2300 - 460 = 1840 \]

Hortex needs to produce an additional number of bottles to cover these 1840 people.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of additional bottles needed.

Given that each bottle covers 20% of a person's daily energy requirement, the number of additional bottles required is:
\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = \frac{1840}{\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Additional bottles needed} = \frac{1840}{\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)} = 1840 \times 5 = 9200 \]

Therefore, Hortex has to produce **9200** more bottles of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The Hortex company needs to produce **9200 more bottles of juice** to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.<|im_end|>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.
So 2300 people, need 5 * 2300 = <<2300*5=11500>>11500 juices for this purpose.
To cover 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, Hortex would need to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 bottles of juices.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of octuplets
Carla has given birth to eight (8) identical octuplets.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of octuplets dressed in purple
She dresses three-fourths (3/4) of the octuplets in purple.
\[ \text{Number of purple-dressed octuplets} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of octuplets dressed in blue
She dresses one-fourth (1/4) of the octuplets in blue.
\[ \text{Number of blue-dressed octuplets} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many blue-dressed octuplets also wear bows
We know that half (1/3) of the blue-dressed octuplets wear bows.
\[ \text{Number of blue-dressed octuplets who wear bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \]

### Step 5: Determine how many purple-dressed octuplets also wear bows
Half of the purple-dressed octuplets wear bows.
\[ \text{Number of purple-dressed octuplets who wear bows} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of octuplets who wear bows
Sum up the numbers from steps 4 and 5.
\[ \text{Total number of octuplets who wear bows} = \frac{2}{3} + 3 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{11}{3} \approx 3.67 \]
Since we can't have a fraction of an octuplet, we'll assume the closest whole number for practical purposes.

### Step 7: Calculate the probability of a randomly chosen octuplet wearing a bow
Given that there are approximately 4 octuplets out of the total 8 who wear bows, the probability is:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of octuplets who wear bows}}{\text{Total number of octuplets}} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies

Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tax reports were received on Wednesday. We can do this by breaking down the information given into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of reports received from Monday to Tuesday.
- The total number of reports received from Monday to Tuesday is given as 1907.

### Step 2: Determine the number of reports received from Thursday to Friday.
- The total number of reports received from Thursday to Friday is given as 2136.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday.
- To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received from Monday to Tuesday and from Thursday to Friday from the total number of reports received in the entire week (which is 5168).

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the total number of reports received in the week,
- \( M \) as the number of reports received from Monday to Tuesday,
- \( F \) as the number of reports received from Thursday to Friday.

From the given information:
\[ T = 5168 \]
\[ M + F = 1907 \]
\[ M + F = 2136 \]

Since both equations represent the same sum (from Monday to Tuesday and from Thursday to Friday), we can see that there must be an error or inconsistency in the provided data because these two sums cannot be equal. However, for the sake of solving the problem, let's assume the correct value should match one of them.

Given:
\[ M + F = 2136 \]

We know:
\[ T - (M + F) = \text{Reports on Wednesday} \]

Substitute \( M + F \):
\[ T - 2136 = \text{Reports on Wednesday} \]

Now substitute \( T \) with 5168:
\[ 5168 - 2136 = \text{Reports on Wednesday} \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 5168 - 2136 = 3032 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is **3032**.<|im_end|>","Mon/Tues = 1907

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of land sold in dollars:**
   - Abraham sold half of his land (which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) square meters).
   - The price per square meter for this sale was $50.
   - So, the total earnings from this sale are \( 40 \times 50 = 2000 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the remaining land after the first sale:**
   - After the first sale, the remaining land is \( 80 - 40 = 40 \) square meters.

3. **Calculate the second sale:**
   - Abraham sold one-fourth of his remaining land (which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) square meters).
   - The price per square meter for this sale was $30.
   - So, the total earnings from this sale are \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the remaining land after the second sale:**
   - After the second sale, the remaining land is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) square meters.

5. **Calculate the final sales:**
   - Abraham sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.
   - So, the total earnings from this final sale are \( 30 \times 3 = 90 \) dollars.

6. **Calculate the total earnings from all sales:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from first sale + Earnings from second sale + Earnings from final sale
   - Total earnings = \( 2000 + 300 + 90 = 2490 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is **$2490**.<|im_end|>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.

So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let \( H \) represent Haley's age.
Let \( G \) represent Geb's age.

Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can write:
\[ H = 26 \]

### Step 2: Express Geb's age in terms of Haley's age
According to the problem, Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. We can express this relationship as:
\[ G = \frac{H}{2} - 10 \]

### Step 3: Substitute Haley's age into the equation
Substitute \( H = 26 \) into the equation from Step 2:

   - Let \( A_2 \) be the number of apartments in the second complex.
   - Let \( A_3 \) be the number of apartments in the third complex.

   We know that:
   \[
   A_1 = A_2 = 200
   \]
   
   The third complex has 60% more apartments than the sum of the first two complexes:
   \[
   A_3 = 2A_1 + 0.6(A_1 + A_2)
   \]

2. **Substitute the known values into the equation for \( A_3 \):**
   \[
   A_3 = 2(200) + 0.6((200) + (200))
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   A_3 = 400 + 0.6(400)
   \]
   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   A_3 = 400 + 240
   \]
   Add these together:
   \[
   A_3 = 640
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apartments collected each week:**
   \[
   Total\ Apartments\ Collected\ Weekly = A_1 + A_2 + A_3
   \]
   Substitute the values:
   \[
   Total\ Apartments\ Collected\ Weekly = 200 + 200 + 640
   \]
   Add these together:
   \[
   Total\ Apartments\ Collected\ Weekly = 1040
   \]

4. **Determine the amount John earns per week:**
   \[
   Earnings\ Per\ Week = Total\ Apartments\ Collected\ Weekly \times $0.40
   \]
   Substitute the value:
   \[
   Earnings\ Per\ Week = 1040 \times $0.40
   \]
   Multiply:
   \[
   Earnings\ Per\ Week = $416
   \]

Therefore, John makes \(\boxed{416}\) dollars per week.<|im_end|>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of fruits produced by each age of avocado tree**

- **5-Year-Old Avocado Tree**: Produces 50 fruits.
  
- **6-Year-Old Avocado Tree**: Produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits as the 5-year-old tree.

\[ \text{Fruits from 6-year-old} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \]

- **7-Year-Old Avocado Tree**: Produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits as the 5-year-old tree.

\[ \text{Fruits from 7-year-old} = 7 \times 50 = 350 \]

- **8-Year-Old Avocado Tree**: Produces 200 fewer fruits than the 10-year-old tree.

\[ \text{Fruits from 8-year-old} = 50 - 200 = -150 \] (This result seems incorrect because it cannot be negative. Let's correct our approach.)

**Correction Step:** The 8-year-old tree should produce more fruits based on the given information.

Let's assume the 8-year-old tree produces \(x\) fruits.

Given that the 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits, we can set up the equation for the 10-year-old tree to find \(x\):

\[ x = 20 \times 50 = 1000 \]

So, the 8-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.

Now, using the corrected value for the 8-year-old tree:

\[ \text{Fruits from 8-year-old} = 1000 \]

**Step 2: Summarize the total fruits produced by each age**

- **5-Year-Old**: 50 fruits
- **6-Year-Old**: 150 fruits
- **7-Year-Old**: 350 fruits
- **8-Year-Old**: 1000 fruits
- **10-Year-Old**: 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits produced by all ages over their lifetimes**

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 1000 + 1000 \]

\[ \text{Total fruits} = 2550 \]

Therefore, during its 10 years of life, an avocado tree can produce a total of **2550 fruits**.<|im_end|>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.
At 7 years, it produces 50 * 7 = <<50*7=350>>350 fruits
At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Sophia gives to Jack
Sophia has $100 initially. She gives Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her total amount.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of $100:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

So, Sophia gives Jack $20.

### Step 2: Add the amount given by Sophia to Jack's initial amount
Jack initially has $100. After receiving $20 from Sophia, we add that to his original amount.

Calculate the new total for Jack:
\[
100 + 20 = 120

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
   Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
   Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - According to the problem, ""the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope,"" so we have:
     \[
     R = 4B
     \]
   - It also states that ""the blue rope was seven centimeters shorter than the yellow rope,"" so:
     \[
     B = Y - 7
     \]

3. **Combine the Equations:**
   Substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
   \[
   R = 4(Y - 7)
   \]

4. **Sum of All Rope Lengths:**
   We know the total length of all three ropes together is 37 cm:
   \[
   R + B + Y = 37
   \]

5. **Substitute Back Substituted Values:**
   From \( R = 4(BY-7) \), substitute back into the sum equation:
   \[
   4(BY-7) + B + Y = 37
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Distribute and combine like terms:
   \[
   4BY - 28 + B + Y = 37
   \]
   Combine constants:
   \[
   4BY + B + Y = 65
   \]

7. **Factorize or Solve for Variables:**
   Factor out \( B \):
   \[
   (4Y + 1)(Y + 1) = 65
   \]
   This can be solved by factoring or using numerical methods.

8. **Find Integer Solutions:**
   We need integer solutions for \( Y \). Trying different values:
   - For \( Y = 9 \):
     \[
     (4(9) + 1)(9 + 1) = 37 \times 10 = 370 \neq 65
     \]
   - For \( Y = 5 \):
     \[
     (4(5) + 1)(5 + 1) = 21 \times 6 = 126 \neq 65
     \]
   - For \( Y = 4 \):
     \[
     (4(4) + 1)(4 + 1) = 17 \times 5 = 85 \neq 65
     \]
   - For \( Y = 3 \):
     \[
     (4(3) + 1)(3 + 1) = 13 \times 4 = 52 \neq 65
     \]
   - For \( Y = 2 \):
     \[
     (4(2) + 1)(2 + 1) = 9 \times 3 = 27 \neq 65
     \]
   - For \( Y = 1 \):
     \[
     (4(1) + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \times 2 = 10 \neq 65
     \]

9. **Re-evaluate Possible Values:**
   Rechecking possible values shows none work directly. Correcting our approach:
   - Try \( Y = 5 \) again but correctly solving:
     \[
     4(5) + 1 = 21 \\
     5 + 1 = 6 \\
     21 \times 6 = 126 \neq 65
     \]

### Conclusion:
Given constraints, correct approach should recheck assumptions:
Final solution yields consistent lengths fitting equations properly:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much Rissa was initially given:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial amount of money Rissa received.
   - According to the problem, Rissa received ""thrice"" as much as Ronnie.
     So, if Ronnie received \$5, then Rissa received \( 3 \times 5 = \$15 \).

2. **Calculate the total amount of money given away:**
   - Ronnie gave \$5.
   - Rissa gave \$15 (as calculated above).
   - Total money given away: \( 5 + 15 = \$20 \).

3. **Find out how much money Rissa has after giving away \$20:**
   - Initially, Rissa had \$15.
   - She gives away \$20.
   - Money left with Rissa: \( 15 - 20 = -\$5 \) (which means she owes someone or needs help).

Since Rissa ended up owing money, we need to consider that the remaining amount might be distributed differently.

4. **Assume the distribution happens equally between both siblings:**
   - Since they have the same amount left, let’s denote this common value by \( y \).
   - This implies Rissa also owes \( y \).

5. **Risa's situation:**
   - We know that Risa ends up with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of what she started with.
   - If we assume Risa's initial amount was \( z \), then after giving away \$20, she should end up with \( \frac{4}{5}z \).

6. **Set up the equation based on the information:**
   - The equation representing Risa's situation is:
     \[
     z - 20 = \frac{4}{5}z
     \]

7. **Solve for \( z \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( z \):
     \[
     z - \frac{4}{5}z = 20
     \]
     \[
     \left(1 - \frac{4}{5}\right)z = 20
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{5}z = 20
     \]
     \[
     z = 20 \times 5
     \]
     \[
     z = 100
     \]

So, Risa initially had \$100.

8. **Recheck the calculation:**
   - Risa indeed owed \$5 when distributing her money ($100 - \$20 = \$80), so the correct interpretation is that she ends up owing \$5.

9. **Final Answer:**
   - Since Risa ends up owing \$5, and since Ronnie didn't give anything but got his share, the final answer is simply that Ronnie still has his original \$5.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} \$5.<|im_end|>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much red paint was used in the mural given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, half the mural is yellow, and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the proportion of each color**:
   - Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's denote the amount of each color as \( x \). Therefore, the total amount of paint (which is 12 pints) can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + x + x = 3x = 12 \text{ pints}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pints}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of yellow paint**:
   - We know that half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]

3. **Verify the total amount of paint**:
   - Summing up all the painted parts should give us the total amount of paint used:
     \[
     \text{Red} + \text{White} + \text{Purple} + \text{Yellow} = 4 \text{ pints} + 4 \text{ pints} + 4 \text{ pints} + 6 \text{ pints} = 18 \text{ pints}
     \]
   - However, since the total paint used is only 12 pints, it seems there might be an error or misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the information provided.

Given that the total paint used is indeed 12 pints, and considering the proportions correctly calculated above, it appears there was an inconsistency in the initial setup or interpretation of the problem. 

However, based on the correct calculation of each color being 4 pints and the total being 12 pints, the remaining part must be yellow, which does not match our earlier understanding of the problem.

Therefore, if we adhere strictly to the given data and the logical steps without assuming any errors in the initial conditions:

- The amount of red paint used is 4 pints.
  
So, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom measures 20 ft by 12 ft.
   - Area of one bedroom = \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.

2. **Determine the area of the living room:**
   - The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
   - Living room area = \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

3. **Calculate the total area for all four bedrooms:**
   - Total area for four bedrooms = \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

4. **Add the area of the living room to the total area of the bedrooms:**
   - Combined area (bedrooms + living room) = \(960 + 1200 = 2160\) square feet.

5. **Subtract the combined area from the total house area given:**
   - Given total area of the house = 1000 square feet.
   - Remaining area after accounting for bedrooms and living room = \(1000 - 2160\).

Since we've already calculated that the combined area of the bedrooms and living room exceeds the total house area provided, it indicates there might be an error or inconsistency in the information provided. However, based on the calculations above, if we were to continue without correction, the calculation would lead us into negative values which is not physically possible.

Given the context, it seems there was a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the information provided. Let's correct this and provide a more logical conclusion:

- Corrected approach:
  
    1. Calculate the area of one bedroom again: \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.
    
    2. Determine the area of the living room correctly: 
       - Since the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, its area should be \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.
       
    3. Calculate the total area for all four bedrooms: \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.
    
    4. Add the area of the living room to the total area of the bedrooms: \(960 + 1200 = 2160\) square feet.
    
    5. Subtract the combined area from the total house area given: \(1000 - 2160\) which results in a negative number indicating an impossible situation.

Therefore, the corrected steps lead us to conclude that there is an inconsistency in the data provided, leading to an impossible scenario where the total house area cannot accommodate the described dimensions as per the given constraints.

**Final Answer:** The total area of the house is incorrect due to the provided data. There seems to be a mistake in either the measurements or the relationship between the living room and the bedrooms. Please check the data provided and correct it accordingly before proceeding with the calculation.<|im_end|>","The bedrooms are each 20*12=<<20*12=240>>240 square feet

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Initial Count
On Monday, Alice counts 3 puff clouds.

### Step 2: Increase in Number of Puff Clouds
Each day after Monday, the number of puff clouds doubles compared to the previous day.

- **Monday**: 3 puff clouds
- **Tuesday**: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puff clouds
- **Wednesday**: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puff clouds
- **Thursday**: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puff clouds
- **Friday**: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puff clouds

So, the number of puff clouds on each day from Monday to Friday is:
- Monday: 3
- Tuesday: 6
- Wednesday: 12
- Thursday: 24
- Friday: 48

### Step 3: Total Number of Puff Clouds Across All Five Days
Now, let's add up the total number of puff clouds over the five days:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

We can sum these numbers step-by-step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Therefore, the total number of puff clouds Alice will have counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is **93**.<|im_end|>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.
On Wednesday she sees twice that amount, 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 puffs of clouds.
On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

                    question:
                    ? A regular box of 100 ! dishwasher pods costs $12. There's , currently a , special size , box : for the ? same price that , has ! 20% more pods. ! How many dishwashing cycles , with . the new box can : you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of pods in the current box.
- The current box contains 100 dishwasher pods.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pods in the special box.
- The special box offers 20% more pods than the current box.
- To find the number of pods in the special box, calculate 20% of 100 and add it to 100.

\[ \text{Number of pods} = 100 + (0.20 \times 100) \]

\[ \text{Number of pods} = 100 + 20 \]

\[ \text{Number of pods} = 120 \]

So, the special box contains 120 dishwasher pods.

### Step 3: Determine how many dishwashing cycles can be performed with one pod.
- Each cycle uses one pod.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cycles possible with the special box.
- Since there are 120 pods, the number of cycles is simply the number of pods.

\[ \text{Total cycles} = 120 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, with the special box containing 120 pods, you can perform 120 dishwashing cycles using 1 pod per cycle.

{The final answer is} 120 dishwashing cycles.<|im_end|>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of $20 bills Thomas initially has:**
   - Thomas withdrew $1000.
   - Each bill is worth $20.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bills} = \frac{\$1000}{\$20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. **Determine how many bills Thomas lost during his trip home:**
   - Thomas lost 10 bills.

3. **Calculate the remaining number of bills after losing some:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

4. **Find out how much money Thomas spent on paying the bill:**
   - Half of the remaining bills were used to pay for the bill.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on bill} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = \$20
   \]

5. **Calculate how much money Thomas had left after using half of the remaining bills:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$1000 - \$20 = \$980
   \]

6. **Triple the amount of money Thomas has left:**
   \[
   \text{Tripled money} = 3 \times \$980 = \$2940
   \]

7. **Convert all the remaining bills to $5 bills:**
   - The tripling means there are now 3 times as many bills (since he tripled them).
   - Since he originally had 40 bills, now he has \(3 \times 40 = 120\) bills.
   - Convert these back to $5 bills:
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{120 \text{ bills}}{5 \text{ dollars per bill}} = 24 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate accordingly.

### Step 1: Calculate Goals Scored by Team A in the First Half

Given that team A scores 4 goals in the first half:

\[ \text{Goals by Team A} = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Goals Scored by Team B in the First Half

Team B scores 2 fewer goals than team A:

\[ \text{Goals by Team B} = 4 - 2 = 2 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Goals Scored by Team A in the Second Half

According to the problem, team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of goals scored by team B in the first half:

\[ \text{Goals by Team A in Second Half} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5 \]

However, since the number of goals must be an integer, let’s assume the problem meant to say ""one quarter"" instead of ""half"". This would imply that team A scores one quarter of the goals scored by team B in the first half.

If so, then:

\[ \text{Goals by Team A in Second Half} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5 \]

Since we typically round to whole numbers in such problems unless specified otherwise, let's assume the problem intended ""one quarter"".

### Step 4: Calculate Total Goals Scored by Both Teams

Adding up all the goals scored by both teams:

\[ \text{Total Goals Scored} = 4 + 2 + 0.5 = 6.5 \]

This calculation seems incorrect because the number of goals should be an integer. Let's re-evaluate if the problem was meant to have different interpretations or if there was a misinterpretation.

### Re-evaluating Assumptions:

- If the problem meant ""one quarter"", then:
\[ \text{Goals by Team A in Second Half} = 0.25 \]
But again, rounding to whole numbers suggests the problem might have been intended differently.

### Correct Interpretation:

Assuming the correct interpretation leads us to realize the problem was misinterpreted initially and needs adjustment:

- **Revised Calculation for Goals in Second Half**:
\[ \text{Goals by Team A in Second Half} = 1 \] (as per typical problem constraints)
So,
\[ \text{Goals by Team A in Second Half} = 1 \]

### Final Calculation:

Adding up all the goals:

\[ \text{Total Goals Scored} = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]<|im_end|>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial amount of chalk**: 5 inches.
2. **Recycling criteria**: Recycle if less than 2 inches.
3. **Usage pattern**: Uses 20% of the chalk per day.
4. **Problem details**:
   - Monday: Used 45% of the chalk.
   - Needs more help, so writes more than usual.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of pieces of chalk needed.
- Let \( N \) be the total number of pieces of chalk available initially.
- Each piece can cover some area (we'll assume each covers an equal area).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces used in one day at 20%.
- Number of pieces used = \( 0.2N \).

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining pieces after one day.
- Remaining pieces = \( N - 0.2N = 0.8N \).

### Step 4: Check if these remaining pieces are recyclable.
- Since we don't know the exact size of the chalkboard or the total chalk needed, we'll assume the pieces are all equal in size and fit perfectly without gaps.

### Step 5: Repeat the process for subsequent days until the pieces are too small to be recycled.
- For each day, calculate the remaining pieces as follows:
  - After Day 1: \( 0.8N \)
  - After Day 2: \( 0.8 \times 0.8N = 0.64N \)
  - After Day 3: \( 0.8 \times 0.64N = 0.512N \)

Continue this process until you reach a point where the remaining pieces are less than 2 inches.

### Step 6: Find the number of days required to reach a condition where recycling becomes necessary.
- We start with 5 pieces.
- Continue reducing by half each time until fewer than 2 inches remain.

By trial and error or iterative calculation, you will find that after approximately 9 days, the remaining pieces will not be large enough to meet the recycling criterion.

### Final Answer:
After approximately 9 days, the teacher needs to start recycling because the remaining pieces will no longer be large enough to cover the chalkboard effectively.

Thus, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 9 days.<|im_end|>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

To determine how many students are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
- There are 12 girls in total.
- One-third (1/3) of the girls are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
- There are 12 boys in total.
- One-fourth (1/4) of the boys are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

### Step 3: Sum the number of students on varsity.
- Girls on varsity: 4
- Boys on varsity: 3

\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.
- Total number of students: \(12\) girls + \(12\) boys = \(24\)

\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the milk:**
   - The company sells 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   - Total revenue = Number of gallons × Price per gallon
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 4000 \times 3.5 = \$14,000
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of milk that has passed the expiration date:**
   - According to Mr. Marcellus, 2/5 of the milk was expired.
   - Amount of expired milk = (2/5) × Total milk sold
     \[
     \text{Amount of expired milk} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}

                    Wendy is five times as ; old as Colin will : be seven years from now. ? In . 25 , years, Colin will be a third . as old as Wendy is now. , How , old ? is Colin now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define variables for the current ages of Wendy and Colin.

Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.
Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

Given information:

1. Wendy is currently five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
   This can be written as: 
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
   This can be written as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

Now we have two equations:

Equation 1 (from Wendy's statement):
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

Equation 2 (from the future statement about their ages):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

First, let's substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2 to find \( W \).

Substitute \( W \) in terms of \( C \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

Simplify inside the parentheses first:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5C}{3} + \frac{35}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

Rearrange to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be Colin's age now.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of books that can be bought at once.
Bob has $27000 to spend on books.

- The cost of buying 100 books is $500.
  
To find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy, we divide the total amount by the cost of one set:

\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\$27000}{\$500} \]

### Step 2: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]
So, Bob can buy 54 sets of 100 books.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of books in all three schools combined.
Since there are 3 schools, we multiply the number of sets by the number of books per set:

\[ \text{Total books} = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

### Step 4: Divide the total number of books by the number of schools.
There are 3 schools, so we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} \]

### Step 5: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

### Final Answer:
Bob can buy **1800** books per school.<|im_end|>","He spends 27000/3=$<<27000/3=9000>>9000

<|im_start|>west
Let's break down the sequence of events step by step:

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - Two apples fell from a tree.
   - One lands on Newton's head.

2. **First Action**:
   - Newton picks up both apples (one for himself and one for someone else).

3. **Second Action**:
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket and throws the other apple into the tree.

4. **Third Action**:
   - The thrown apple hits the tree again and causes five more apples to fall off.

5. **Fourth Action**:
   - Newton picks up all remaining apples except one and throws that one at the tree.

6. **Fifth Action**:
   - Another six apples fall out due to this action.

7. **Final Step**:
   - Newton picks up all remaining apples and goes home to make a pie.

Now let's determine how many apples were brought home.

- Initially, there were two apples.
- After picking up the first two apples, there was one left over.
- Putting one in his pocket leaves him with zero apples.
- Throwing away the last one causes five more to fall, leaving him with four apples.
- Picking up the fourth apple leaves him with three apples.
- Throwing away the fifth apple leaves him with two apples.
- Picking up the sixth apple leaves him with one apple.
- Throwing away the seventh apple leaves him with no apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home **seven apples**.

   - Total coal required is 850 kg.

   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total coal}}{\text{Coal per bag}} = \frac{850}{50}
   \]

2. **Perform the division:**

   \[
   \frac{850}{50} = 17
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of bags and the price per unit:**
   - Cost per bag is $18.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of bags}) \times (\text{Cost per bag})
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of slices per pie.
- Cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices.
- Pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices needed for all friends.
Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats 6 slices from the cheese pizza and 4 slices from the pepperoni pizza.
Total slices for one friend = (6 cheese slices + 4 pepperoni slices) = 10 slices per friend.

Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices needed = 10 slices/friend * 6 friends = 60 slices.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pies needed based on the number of slices per pie.
We have already calculated that we need 12 slices for the cheese pizza and 8 slices for the pepperoni pizza.
So, we can determine the number of pies required as follows:

For the cheese pizza: \( \frac{12 slices}{12 slices/pie} = 1 pie \)
For the pepperoni pizza: \( \frac{8 slices}{8 slices/pie} = 1 pie \)

Since both types of pizzas require only 1 slice each, they will be served directly from the same pie without needing additional pies.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total number of pies she needs to buy is **1 pie**.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 1 pie.<|im_end|>","Kate’s friends eat 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 cheese pizza slices.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Sam ran over the week. We'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Sam ran from Monday to Friday.**

- **Monday:** Sam runs 3 miles.
- **Wednesday:** Sam runs 3 miles.
- **Friday:** Sam runs 3 miles.

Total for these three days = \( 3 + 3 + 3 \) miles.

\[
= 9 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday.**

- **Tuesday:** Sam runs 5 miles.
- **Thursday:** Sam runs 5 miles.

Total for Tuesday and Thursday = \( 5 + 5 \) miles.

\[
= 10 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 3: Add the distances from Step 1 and Step 2 together to get the total for the week.**

\[
\text{Total} = (9 \text{ miles}) + (10 \text{ miles})

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Jay to collect enough snowballs for his snowball fight, let's break down the problem into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the net number of snowballs added per hour.
Jay builds 20 snowballs per hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. First, calculate how many melts occur in one hour:

- There are 4 intervals of 15 minutes in one hour.
- Each interval results in 2 melting.

So, the total number of melts in one hour = \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \).

Now, subtract the total number of melted snowballs from the total number built:

\[
20 - 8 = 12
\]

This means Jay adds 12 snowballs every hour after accounting for the melting process.

### Step 2: Calculate the time required to reach 60 snowballs.
We need to find out how many hours it takes for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs at the rate of 12 snowballs per hour.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total desired snowballs}}{\text{Snowballs added per hour}} = \frac{60}{12}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take Jay **5 hours** to have 60 snowballs.<|im_end|>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.

It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age based on the information given about John's age and their relationship.

1. **Identify the relationship between John and Jim's ages:**
   - John is twice as old as Jim.
   
2. **Express John's age in terms of Jim's age:**
   Let \( J \) represent Jim's current age.
   Since John is twice as old as Jim, we can write:
   \[
   J = 2J
   \]

3. **Solve for Jim's age using the given information:**
   We know that John is currently 28 years old.
   Therefore,
   \[
   J = 28
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   To ensure our calculation is correct, let's check if John's age matches twice Jim's age:
   \[
   J = 28 \quad (\text{John's age})
   \]
   \[
   \frac{J}{2} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \quad (\text{Jim's age})

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to track the number of bandages used and ordered over three days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Day 1:
- **Initial order**: 38 bandages.
- **First day usage**: 38 bandages (no new order needed).

So, after the first day:
\[ \text{Remaining bandages} = 38 - 38 = 0 \]

### Day 2:
- **Usage**:
    - Since they used 10 fewer bandages than the previous day,
      \( 38 - 10 = 28 \) bandages were used.

- **Ordering**:
    - Order 2 more bulk packs of 50 bandages each.
    - Total ordered: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.

After the second day:
\[ \text{Remaining bandages} = 0 + 28 - 100 = -62 \]

Since there can't be negative remaining bandages, let's correct our approach:
- The initial count should not have been zero; it was actually 100 bandages.
- Therefore, the correct usage for Day 2 would be 98 bandages (since they used 10 fewer than the previous day).

So, after the second day:
\[ \text{Remaining bandages} = 100 - 98 = 2 \]

### Day 3:
- **Usage**:
    - Order 2 more bulk packs of 50 bandages each.
    - Total ordered: \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) bandages.
    - Used half a pack, so that's \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) bandages.
    
- **Remaining bandages**:
    - Bandages left after ordering: \( 100 - 25 = 75 \).
    - Subtract the bandages used during the day: \( 75 - 28 = 47 \).

So, after the third day:
\[ \text{Remaining bandages} = 75 - 28 - 25 = 22 \]

We know from the problem statement that they ended up with 78 bandages at the end of the third day. This means their starting point must have been adjusted accordingly.

### Calculation:
Let’s denote the total bandages initially as \( x \). We know:
\[ x - 38 - 98 - 28 - 25 = 78 \]
Simplifying:
\[ x - 189 = 78 \]
\[ x = 78 + 189 \]
\[ x = 267 \]

Thus, they started with 267 bandages on the first day.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{267}
\]<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.

Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.

                    May is getting ? her : hair cut ? and colored. It costs $40 for the . color and $30 per inch ! of haircut. If her hair started at 10 : inches and , ended ? at ; 8, how much did her cut , and color . cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of inches in May's hair.
May's hair starts at 10 inches and ends at 8 inches.

\[ \text{Total length of hair} = 10 \text{ inches (start)} + 8 \text{ inches (end)} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the haircut.
The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.

\[ \text{Cost of haircut} = 18 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} \]
\[ \text{Cost of haircut} = 540 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of coloring.
The cost of the hair color is given as $40.

### Step 4: Add both costs together to find the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of haircut} + \text{Cost of color} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$540 + \$40 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$580 \]

### Final Answer:
The total cost of May's hair cut and color is \( \boxed{\$580} \).<|im_end|>","She had 2 inches cut because 10-8=<<10-8=2>>2

Let's break down this problem step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Jen's total working hours**

Jen works 7.5 hours per day for 6 days a week.
Total working hours = \( 7.5 \times 6 \)

\[
= 45 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate her basic pay**

Her hourly rate is $1.5.
Basic pay = \( 45 \times 1.5 \)

\[
= \$67.50
\]

**Step 3: Add the bonus amount**

She receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.
Bonus amount = $10

**Step 4: Calculate her total earnings**

Total earnings = Basic pay + Bonus amount

\[
= \$67.50 + \$10
\]

\[
= \$77.50
\]

Therefore, Jen will receive **$77.50** after including both her regular pay and the bonus for complete attendance.<|im_end|>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week

180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Jason earned based on his earnings from different tasks over a two-week period.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings from Laundry
- **Frequency**: Once per week.
- **Earnings per wash**: $3.00.
- **Number of weeks**: 2 (since the problem specifies a two-week period).

\[
\text{Total earnings from laundry} = \left(\frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Weeks}}\right) \times \text{Earnings per wash}
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times 3.00 = 1.50
\]

So, Jason earns $1.50 from washing clothes in one week.

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Taking Trash Out
- **Frequency**: Twice per week.
- **Earnings per chore**: $1.50.

\[
\text{Total earnings from trash removal} = \left(\frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Weeks}}\right) \times \text{Earnings per chore}
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) \times 1.50 = 3.00
\]

So, Jason earns $3.00 from taking trash out in one week.

### Step 3: Calculate Earnings from Emptying Dishwasher
- **Frequency**: Once per week.
- **Earnings per chore**: $0.50.

\[
\text{Total earnings from dishwasher} = \left(\frac{\text{Frequency}}{\text{Weeks}}\right) \times \text{Earnings per chore}
\]

\[
= \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times 0.50 = 0.25
\]

So, Jason earns $0.25 from emptying the dishwasher in one week.

### Step 4: Sum Up All Earnings
Now, let's add up all the earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from laundry} + \text{Earnings from trash removal} + \text{Earnings from dishwasher}
\]

\[
= 1.50 + 3.00 + 0.25 = 5.00
\]

Therefore, Jason earned a total of $5.00 over the two-week period.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
The final answer is The final answer is 5.00.<|im_end|>","Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00

Jason took the trash out 2 times at $0.75 each so he made 2*.75 = $<<2*.75=1.50>>1.50
Jason cleaned his room 1 time at $1.50 each so he made 1*1.50 = $<<1*1.50=1.50>>1.50

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Understand the given information**

- Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
- A shark has three times as much blood as a single whale.

**Step 2: Determine how much blood one shark has**

Since a shark has three times as much blood as a single whale, we can calculate the amount of blood one shark has using the following formula:

\[ \text{Blood per Shark} = 3 \times (\text{Blood per Whale}) \]

Given that each whale has 40 gallons of blood, we substitute this value into the equation:

\[ \text{Blood per Shark} = 3 \times 40 \]

\[ \text{Blood per Shark} = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

So, each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks**

Now, to find out how many gallons of blood there would be if ten sharks were swimming together, we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by ten:

\[ \text{Total Blood for Ten Sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood per Shark} \]

Substituting the amount of blood one shark has:

\[ \text{Total Blood for Ten Sharks} = 10 \times 120 \]

\[ \text{Total Blood for Ten Sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is **1200 gallons**.<|im_end|>","Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, then a shark has 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 gallons of blood.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant throughout the day. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of people who entered between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM
- **First group**: 50 people entered between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM.

### Step 2: Determine the number of people who entered between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM
- **Second group**: 40 more people entered between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.

Let's calculate the total for these two groups:
\[ \text{Total for both groups} = 50 + 40 = 90 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of people who entered after 9:00 AM
- **Third group**: 60 more people entered after 9:00 AM (since \(2 \times 40 = 80\) and \(3 \times 80 = 240\)).

### Step 4: Determine the total number of people who entered the restaurant from the start until the end of the day
- Total number of people entering = Sum of all three groups:
\[ 50 + 40 + 60 = 150 \]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 150.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The number of people who came in at lunch is twice the number that came in at 10:00: 2 * 40 people = <<2*40=80>>80 people.

1. Determine the number of packs of black pens.
2. Calculate the total number of red pens.
3. Calculate the total number of black pens.
4. Sum the total number of red and black pens.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine the number of packs of black pens
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. She also bought ""twice as much"" black pens as red pens. Therefore, she bought:
\[ 5 \text{ (red pens)} \times 2 = 10 \text{ (black pens)} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of red pens
Each pack contains 5 red pens. Since there are 5 packs of red pens, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ (packs of red pens)} \times 5 \text{ (pens per pack)} = 25 \text{ (red pens)} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of black pens
We already calculated that she bought 10 packs of black pens. Each pack contains 5 black pens, so the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ (packs of black pens)} \times 5 \text{ (pens per pack)} = 50 \text{ (black pens)} \]

### Step 4: Sum the total number of red and black pens
Now, we add the total number of red and black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ (red pens)} + 50 \text{ (black pens)} = 75 \text{ (total pens)} \]

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

### Final Answer

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost per bottle of Scotch
John spends a total of $600 on 10 bottles of Scotch.

Cost per bottle of Scotch = Total cost / Number of bottles
= $600 / 10
= $60

So, each bottle of Scotch costs $60.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of Cognac
John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as Scotch.
Number of bottles of Cognac = 2 × Number of bottles of Scotch
= 2 × 10
= 20

### Step 3: Determine the cost per bottle of Cognac
Cognac costs 50% more than Scotch.

Since each bottle of Scotch costs $60, each bottle of Cognac costs:
$60 + (0.5 × $60) = $60 + $30 = $90

So, each bottle of Cognac costs $90.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of Cognac
Total cost of Cognac = Cost per bottle of Cognac × Number of bottles of Cognac
= $90 × 20
= $1800

### Step 5: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent
Total amount spent = Cost of Scotch + Cost of Cognac
= $600 + $1800
= $2400

Therefore, John spends a total of $2400 on everything.<|im_end|>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days.

### Step 1: Determine the number of trees planted on the first day

Given that Mr. Julius planted:
- Twenty trees (let's assume these are all white oak)

On the second day, he planted:
- \( \frac{1}{2} \) times as many Lodgepole Pines as White Oaks from the first day.
- Additionally, 10 more White Oaks and an amount equal to one quarter of the number of Lodgepole Pines from the first day.

Let's denote:
- \( W_1 \) = Number of White Oaks planted on the first day = 20
- \( L_1 \) = Number of Lodgepole Pines planted on the first day

From the information given:

\[ L_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times W_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

So, on the first day:
- Total number of trees planted = \( W_1 + L_1 = 20 + 10 = 30 \).

### Step 2: Determine the number of trees planted on the second day

According to the problem:
- He planted 10 more White Oaks on the second day.
- He also planted an amount equal to one quarter of the number of Lodgepole Pines from the first day on the second day.

From the information given:

\[ L_2 = \frac{1}{4} \times L_1 = \frac{1}{4} \times 10 = 2.5 \]

Since it's not possible to plant half a tree, let's assume he planted 2 or 3 trees based on practical considerations. Given the context, I'll take 2 for simplicity:

\[ W_2 = W_1 + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ L_2 = 2 \]

So, on the second day:
- Total number of trees planted = \( W_2 + L_2 = 30 + 2 = 32 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days

Adding the totals from both days:

\[ Total = First Day + Second Day = 30 + 32 = 62 \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:

{The final answer is} **62**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees
Mr. Julius planted a total of 50 trees + 30 trees + 40 trees + 20 trees = <<50+30+40+20=140>>140 trees.

To solve this problem, we need to track the progress of the root beer over the four days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial amount**: Fred makes 24 gallons of root beer.

2. **First Day**:
   - Fred puts all 24 gallons into the refrigerator cooler.
   
3. **Second Day**:
   - His wife Barbie discovers the root beer and spills 7 gallons.
   - Remaining: \( 24 \text{ gallons} - 7 \text{ gallons} = 17 \text{ gallons} \).

4. **Third Day**:

                    question:
                    There are 66 fish in the fish tank. One-third ! of the fish ! have red stripes, , and 5/11 of the remaining . fish have blue stripes. . Altogether, how many ! fish have ? red ! stripes and : blue . stripes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of fish with red stripes.
We know there are 66 fish in total. According to the problem, one-third of these fish have red stripes.

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
\]

Calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, there are **22** fish with red stripes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of fish that do not have red stripes.
Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

\[
\text{Remaining fish after removing those with red stripes} = 66 - 22
\]

Calculate:

\[
66 - 22 = 44
\]

So, there are **44** fish that do not have red stripes.

### Step 3: Determine the number of fish with blue stripes.
According to the problem, five-elevenths (or approximately 0.4286) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

First, calculate the fraction of the remaining fish that have blue stripes:

\[
\text{Fraction of remaining fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11}
\]

Now, find out how many of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44
\]

Calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, there are **20** fish with blue stripes.

### Step 4: Add the number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes together.
Finally, add the number of fish with red stripes to the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[
\text{Total number of fish with either red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20
\]

Calculate:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the total number of fish with either red or blue stripes is **42**.

### Conclusion:
The final answer is:

\boxed{42}<|im_end|>","One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of eyeshadow palettes and makeup sets:**
   - Amy has 2 palettes.
   - She also has 3 makeup sets.

2. **Determine the total number of eyeshadow colors available initially:**
   - Each palette contains 4 colors.
     - Total colors in palettes = \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
   - Each makeup set contains 6 colors.
     - Total colors in makeup sets = \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

   - Total colors available initially = \(8 + 18 = 26\).

3. **Account for the stolen palette:**
   - One palette is stolen, so we subtract its colors from the initial total.
     - Remaining colors after theft = \(26 - 4 = 22\).

4. **Consider Amy using up half of the colors from one makeup set:**
   - Amy uses half of the colors from one makeup set.
     - Colors used from one makeup set = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3\).

5. **Calculate the remaining number of eyeshadow colors:**
   - Subtract the used colors from the remaining total.
     - Final number of colors = \(22 - 3 = 19\).

Therefore, Amy has **19** eyeshadow colors left.<|im_end|>","Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.

Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.
Thus, Amy has 22 - 3 = <<22-3=19>>19 eyeshadow colors left.

                    question:
                    Mattison is ? 60 inches tall. His two-story house ? is 7 times as ; high . as ! he is. ! The floor to the ceiling on the ? first floor ! is thrice as , high ! as . he is. ; How high is the roof from the second floor's . floor in inches?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, given that the height difference between the floors follows specific ratios.

1. **Determine Mattison’s height**:
   - Mattison is 60 inches tall.

2. **Calculate the height of the first floor**:
   - The first floor is 7 times taller than Mattison.
   \[
   \text{Height of first floor} = 7 \times 60 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Height of first floor} = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height of the second floor**:
   - The second floor is 3 times taller than the first floor.
   \[
   \text{Height of second floor} = 3 \times \text{Height of first floor}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Height of second floor} = 3 \times 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Height of second floor} = 1260 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the distance from the second floor to the roof**:
   - We know the total height of the house (from ground to roof) is 7 times Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Total height of house} = 7 \times 60 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total height of house} = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]
   
5. **Subtract the height of the second floor from the total height**:
   \[
   \text{Distance from second floor to roof} = \text{Total height of house} - \text{Height of second floor}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance from second floor to roof} = 420 \text{ inches} - 1260 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance from second floor to roof} = -840 \text{ inches}
   \]

This calculation shows an error because it results in a negative value, which doesn't make sense in the context of measuring heights. Let's re-evaluate:

- Correctly calculate the total height of the house considering the correct ratio for the second floor height:
  
    - Total height of house = 7 * 60 inches = 420 inches
    - Height of second floor = 3 * 420 inches = 1260 inches
    
So, let's recalculate correctly:

\[
\text{Distance from second floor to roof} = \text{Total height of house} - \text{Height of second floor}
\]
\[
\text{Distance from second floor to roof} = 420 \text{ inches} - 1260 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
\text{Distance from second floor to roof} = -840 \text{ inches}
\]

Correcting the steps:

1. Calculate the total height of the house: 
\[ 7 \times 60 \text{ inches} = 420 \text{ inches}\]

2. Calculate the height of the second floor:
\[ 3 \times 420 \text{ inches} = 1260 \text{ inches}\]

3. Subtract the height of the second floor from the total height:
\[ 420 \text{ inches} - 1260 \text{ inches} = -840 \text{ inches}\]

Revisiting the steps again, there seems to be an inconsistency due to the incorrect interpretation of the relationship between the floors. Let me correct the approach:

1. Correct understanding of the problem: 
Mattison's height should be used directly without additional factors since the question implies a direct proportional height increase for each subsequent floor level.

2. Recalculating correctly:

    - Mattison's height is 60 inches.
    
    - First floor height is \( 7 \times 60 \) inches.
    
    - Second floor height is \( 3 \times \text{(First floor height)} \).

    - Roof height is \( 7 \times \text{(Mattison's height)} \).

Let's now correctly compute these values:

\[ \text{First floor height} = 7 \times 60 \text{ inches} = 420 \text{ inches} \]

\[ \text{Second floor height} = 3 \times 420 \text{ inches} = 1260 \text{ inches} \]

Since the","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 60 x 3 = <<60*3=180>>180 inches high.
Hence, the roof is 420 - 180 = <<420-180=240>>240 inches high from the second floor's floor.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the total number of shells found.
2. Calculate the number of shells found by each group based on their percentages.
3. Subtract the known values from the total to find out how many shells were left for the Gogetters.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Total Number of Shells Found
The problem states that twenty tourists found 700 shells in a strip.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Shells Found by Each Group
- **Alpha Finders**: 40% of the total shells.
- **Finders**: 60% of the remaining shells after Alpha Finders have been accounted for.

First, let's calculate the number of shells found by the Alpha Finders:
\[ \text{Shells found by Alpha Finders} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

Next, subtract the number of shells found by Alpha Finders from the total number of shells:
\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \]

Now, calculate the number of shells found by the Finders:
\[ \text{Shells found by Finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

Finally, subtract the number of shells found by Finders from the remaining shells:
\[ \text{Remaining shells} = 420 - 252 = 168 \]

These 168 shells will be split between the Alpha Finders and the Gogetters.

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Shells Found by the Gogetters
Since the remaining 168 shells are split equally between the Alpha Finders and the Gogetters:
\[ \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = \frac{168}{2} = 84 \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by the Gogetters is 84.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{84}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the total distance walked by all dogs**

First, let's calculate the total number of miles walked by all four dogs in one day.

- Dog 1 walks 1 mile.
- Dog 2 walks 4 miles.
- Dog 3 walks 3 miles.
- Dog 4 walks (we don't know yet).

Let \( x \) be the number of miles that the fourth dog needs to walk.

**Step 2: Set up an equation for the total distance walked**

According to the information given, the average distance walked by all dogs in one day is 3 miles. Therefore, the sum of the distances walked by all dogs should equal 3 miles.

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 3 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 8 + x = 3 \]
\[ x = 3 - 8 \]
\[ x = -5 \]

This result doesn't make sense because it would imply a negative distance, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

Since the average distance walked by all dogs is 3 miles, and there are only three known distances (1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles), the unknown distance must also contribute to this average.

So, let’s assume the correct interpretation was meant to find out how much more or less than the average the fourth dog needs compared to the others.

Given the averages:
- Average = 3 miles
- Total average distance walked = 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 3 miles

Thus, if the fourth dog needs to walk fewer miles than the average, then:

\[ x < 3 \]

And if the fourth dog needs to walk more miles than the average, then:

\[ x > 3 \]

We'll check both possibilities:

1. If the fourth dog needs to walk fewer miles:
   - Total distance walked = 1 + 4 + 3 + y (where y < 3)
   - Average = (1 + 4 + 3 + y) / 4 = 3
   - Solving for y:
     \[ 10 + y = 12 \]
     \[ y = 2 \]

2. If the fourth dog needs to walk more miles:
   - Total distance walked = 1 + 4 + 3 + z (where z > 3)
   - Average = (1 + 4 + 3 + z) / 4 = 3
   - Solving for z:
     \[ 10 + z = 12 \]
     \[ z = 2 \]

Both scenarios suggest that the fourth dog needs to walk exactly 2 miles.

Therefore, the last dog needs **2 miles** per day.<|im_end|>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of the loan:**
   - The total value of John's home is $250,000.
   - John gets a loan worth 40% of that.
   \[
   \text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   \]

2. **Determine how much John spends on debt payments:**
   - John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
   \[
   \text{Debt Payment Amount} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount in John’s account after making the debt payment:**
   - Subtract the debt payment from the loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of all the tunas.
2. Determine the number of tunas.
3. Calculate the total earnings from selling all the tunas.

Let's start with the total weight calculation:

- The first tuna weighs 56 kg.
- The second tuna weighs 46 kg.
- The third tuna weighs 26 kg.

Total weight = 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg.

Next, let's determine the number of tunas:

Since Deandre only caught three tunas (one on Monday), the number of tunas is 3.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings from selling all the tunas at $0.50 per kilogram:

Earnings = Total weight × Price per kilogram
           = 128 kg × $0.50/kg
           = $64.

Therefore, after selling all the tunas to the market, Deandre will earn $64.

{The final answer is} $64.<|im_end|>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.

                    Trinity . sells magazines at : 11/8 of the price she bought the : magazines. If . she ? bought the magazines at $72, what is ? her profit?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the selling price per magazine
Trinity buys the magazines for $72. According to the problem, she sells them at ""11/8"" of the price she bought them.

- First, calculate \( \frac{11}{8} \) of $72.
  
\[ \text{Selling Price per Magazine} = \left( \frac{11}{8} \right) \times 72 \]

### Step 2: Perform the multiplication
We can simplify the calculation first before multiplying:

\[ \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99 \]

So, Trinity sells each magazine for $99.

### Step 3: Calculate total revenue from selling all magazines
Let's assume Trinity has 'n' number of magazines.

- Total Revenue (TR) = Selling Price per Magazine × Number of Magazines Sold

If we don't know how many magazines she sold, we'll use the selling price directly as a representative unit for simplicity.

- TR = 99 × n

Since no specific number of magazines is given, we proceed without that detail.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying all magazines
Trinity bought these magazines at $72 per magazine.

- Total Cost (TC) = Buying Price per Magazine × Number of Magazines Bought

Again, if we don't have the exact number of magazines bought, we'll use the average buying price per magazine as a representative value.

- TC = 72 × n

### Step 5: Calculate Profit
Profit is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]

Substituting in our expressions:

\[ \text{Profit} = 99n - 72n \]

### Final Answer
After performing all calculations, we get:

\[
\boxed{\text{Profit}} = 27n
\]

This expression indicates that the profit depends on the number of magazines sold (n). Without knowing exactly how many magazines were sold, we cannot provide a numerical figure for the profit. However, the formula above represents the profit based on the quantity of magazines sold.<|im_end|>","Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.
If she bought the magazines at $72, she makes a profit of $99-$72=$27

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much water the dehumidifier removes over different periods using its various settings. Here’s the detailed step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the daily removal rate for each setting.
- **Low Setting:** Removes 1 liter per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water removed at each setting over specified durations.

#### Low Setting:
Brian runs the dehumidifier for 3 days at the low setting.

\[
\text{Water Removed} = \text{Daily Rate} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]

\[
\text{Water Removed} = 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
\]

#### Medium Setting:
Brian runs the dehumidifier for 3 days at the medium setting.

\[
\text{Water Removed} = \text{Daily Rate} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]

\[
\text{Water Removed} = 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
\]

#### High Setting:
Brian runs the dehumidifier for 5 days at the high setting.

\[
\text{Water Removed} = \text{Daily Rate} \times \text{Number of Days}
\]

\[
\text{Water Removed} = 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 3: Sum up all the amounts of water removed.

Now, add the results from each setting together:

\[
\text{Total Water Removed} = (3 \text{ liters}) + (3 \text{ liters}) + (5 \text{ liters})
\]

\[
\text{Total Water Removed} = 11 \text{ liters}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement over the given period is \(11\) liters. {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, for a total of 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day.
The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, for a total of 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 liters of water per day.
3 days on the low setting removes 3*1=<<3*1=3>>3 liters of water.
3 days on the medium setting removes 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 liters of water.
And 5 days on the high setting removes 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 liters of water.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of balloons initially filled.
2. Determine how many balloons were thrown away.
3. Subtract the remaining balloons from the initial count.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Balloons Initially Filled
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.
- There are 10 packs.

\[
\text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack}
\]

\[
\text{Total balloons} = 10 \times 30 = 300
\]

So far, we know there were 300 balloons in total.

### Step 2: Determine How Many Balloons Were Thrown Away
We're told that after the afternoon, only 12 balloons remain.

\[
\text{Balloon throws} = \text{Initial balloons} - \text{Remaining balloons}
\]

\[
\text{Balloon throws} = 300 - 12 = 288
\]

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw away **288** balloons.

### Final Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total volume of both medicines for one dose:**
   - One medicine requires 14 mL.
   - The second medicine requires 3 times as much as the first medicine.

2. **Calculate the volume of the second medicine:**
   \[
   \text{Volume of second medicine} = 3 \times \text{Volume of first medicine}
   \]
   Substituting the given value:
   \[
   \text{Volume of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \text{ mL} = 42 \text{ mL}
   \]

3. **Find the total volume of both medicines combined for one dose:**
   \[
   \text{Total volume for one dose} = \text{Volume of first medicine} + \text{Volume of second medicine}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total volume for one dose} = 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total volume for 8 doses:**
   \[
   \text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times \text{Total volume for one dose}
   \]
   Substituting the calculated value:
   \[
   \text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times 56 \text{ mL} = 448 \text{ mL}

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students that can be accommodated in both schools based on the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine Ali's Class Capacity:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
   
2. **Calculate the capacity of John's Classes:**
   - John has two classes, and each of these classes has a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class.
   - Therefore, the capacity of each of John's classes is \( \frac{120}{8} = 15 \) students.
   
3. **Sum up the capacities of all classes in John's School:**
   - Since John has two classes, the total capacity for his school is \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \) students.

4. **Combine the capacities of both schools:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the repayment process into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest on the loan**
Stephen borrowed $300 and agreed to pay back the principal plus 2% interest. 
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the total amount to be repaid is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many months Stephen has already given her money**
Stephen gives her $25 per month for 11 months.
\[ \text{Total amount given so far} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount that needs to be added after 11 months**
After 11 months, the remaining amount is:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

This remaining amount (31) will be added to the interest at the end of the twelfth month.

**Step 4: Calculate the payment for the twelfth month**
For the twelfth month, the entire remaining amount will be added to the interest, so the payment will be:
\[ 31 \times 1.02 = 31.62 \]

Therefore, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is **$31.62**.<|im_end|>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.
He should return a total of $300 + $6 = $<<300+6=306>>306.
For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

                    question:
                    ; Tim ; enters ? a , competition ; and has to try . and guess the : number of ; red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base . and is 6 : inches by 6 : inches , and 15 inches tall. !  He ? knows that a jelly bean is .15 ; cubic inches. .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how far off Tim's guess was from the actual number of red jelly beans, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.
- The jar is a rectangular prism (a 3D shape).
- Volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  V = l \times w \times h
  \]
  where \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are the length, width, and height of the box respectively.

Given dimensions:
- Length (\( l \)) = 6 inches
- Width (\( w \)) = 6 inches
- Height (\( h \)) = 15 inches

Calculate the volume:
\[
V = 6 \text{ inches} \times 6 \text{ inches} \times 15 \text{ inches}
\]

\[
V = 6 \times 6 \times 15
\]

\[
V = 420 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the effective volume after considering packing efficiency.
Since there is an 80% efficiency rate, only 20% of the jelly beans will fill this space effectively.

\[
\text{Effective Volume} = V_{\text{jar}} \times 0.20
\]

Substitute the value of \( V_{\text{jar}} \):

\[
\text{Effective Volume} = 420 \text{ cubic inches} \times 0.20
\]

\[
\text{Effective Volume} = 84 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the total number of jelly beans based on the given percentage.
Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red. Therefore, if the jar contains 900 red jelly beans, then the total number of jelly beans would be:

\[
\text{Total Number of Jelly Beans} = \frac{\text{Number of Red Jelly Beans}}{0.30}
\]

\[
\text{Total Number of Jelly Beans} = \frac{900}{0.30}
\]

\[
\text{Total Number of Jelly Beans} = 3000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Tim’s guess.
Tim guesses that he could find approximately 300 jelly beans in the jar.

### Step 5: Compare Tim's guess to the actual number.
To find out how far off Tim's guess was, subtract his estimate from the actual number of jelly beans:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Actual Number} - \text{Estimated Number}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 3000 - 300
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 2700
\]

### Conclusion:
Tim's guess was 2700 jelly beans away from the actual number. Thus, his guess was **2700** jelly beans off.<|im_end|>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches

With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Capacity**:
   - The bus has a capacity of 200 people.

2. **Departure from Chengli City**:
   - The bus initially has 20 people on board when it departs Chengli city.

3. **First Stop**:
   - At the first stop, 40 more people enter the bus.
   - Total people after the first stop: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

4. **Second Station**:
   - At the second station, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of those who entered at the first stop also get on the bus.
   - Number of people entering at the second stop: \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\)
   - Total people after the second stop: \(60 + 30 = 90\)

5. **Third Station**:
   - After doubling the number of passengers at the third station (since it's not specified how many were left in the bus), we need to determine what fills up the remaining space.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of people that fill the remaining spaces.
   - According to the problem, this number doubles at the third station, so \(2x\) must fill the remaining spaces.

Since the bus can hold 200 people, if \(x\) filled the remaining spaces, then the equation for the third station would be:
\[ x + 2x = 200 \]
\[ 3x = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \]

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a person, let’s assume they fill exactly 66 or 67 people (the closest whole numbers).

If they fill exactly 66 people:
- Remaining spaces = \(200 - 66 = 134\)

If they fill exactly 67 people:
- Remaining spaces = \(200 - 67 = 133\)

Given that the problem does not specify which exact number was used, but rather just states ""fill the remaining spaces,"" we will use the most straightforward interpretation where \(x = 67\):

                    question:
                    Pauline . visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The cost , of one visit is . $2.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of visits over 5 years
Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.
\[ \text{Total visits in 5 years} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

### Step 2: Determine the initial cost per visit
Initially, the cost of one visit is \( \$2 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in the cost after 5 years
After 5 years, the cost increases by 150%. This means the new cost is 210% (or 3 times) of the original cost.
\[ \text{New cost per visit} = \$2 \times 3 = \$6 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent over the first 5 years
With the new cost, the total amount spent over 5 years is:
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 years} = 15 \times \$6 = \$90 \]

### Step 5: Determine how many additional visits Pauline made beyond the initial 5 years
Pauline continued to make 3 additional visits every year for 3 more years.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of additional visits over the next 3 years
For the next 3 years, she visited:
\[ \text{Additional visits in 3 years} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the total amount spent on these additional visits
Each additional visit costs \( \$6 \), so for 9 additional visits:
\[ \text{Cost of additional visits} = 9 \times \$6 = \$54 \]

### Step 8: Add the costs from both periods
Now we add the amounts from both the initial 5 years and the additional 3 years:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$90 + \$54 = \$144 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$144}
\]<|im_end|>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it takes for all 10 students in each grade to participate in the escape room challenge.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of groups**: 
   - There are 10 students.
   - Each group consists of one student (since only 8 students can be accommodated at a time).

2. **Calculate the total number of groups**:
   - Since there are 10 students and only 8 can fit into one group, the total number of groups formed is \( \frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \). However, since you cannot have a fraction of a group, we interpret this as needing to form 2 groups to accommodate all students (one group will not be fully utilized but still needs to be considered).

3. **Time per group**:
   - Each group has 8 students and they have 45 minutes to complete the challenge.

4. **Total time required**:
   - Time taken by one group: \( \text{time per group} = \frac{45 \text{ minutes}}{8 \text{ students}} \).
     \[
     \text{time per group} = \frac{45}{8} = 5.625 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Since there are two groups (one fully utilized and one partially utilized), the total time needed would be approximately twice the time taken by one group because the second group also gets 45 minutes to attempt the challenge. 

However, if we consider that the second group does not use its full 45 minutes due to space constraints, we might need to adjust our calculation accordingly. But based on the given information and standard assumptions, let's proceed with the above steps.

### Final Calculation:

Given that each group requires 5.625 minutes and there are two groups (one fully utilized and one partially utilized):

\[
\text{Total time} = 5.625 \times 2 = 11.25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and roof frames that Ali produced.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the wooden tables.
- Number of wooden tables = 4
- Cost per wooden table = $20
Total cost for wooden tables = 4 × $20 = $80

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the roof frames.
- Number of roof frames = 2
- Cost per roof frame = $10
Total cost for roof frames = 2 × $10 = $20

Step 3: Add the costs from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount Ali has to pay John.
Total payment = Total cost for wooden tables + Total cost for roof frames
Total payment = $80 + $20 = $100

Therefore, Ali has to pay John a total of $100. The final answer is {The final answer is} $100.<|im_end|>","For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece.

2. **Express the Longer Piece in Terms of \( x \):**
   According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Longer piece} = 4x
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Length:**
   The total length of the board is given as 40 feet. This means the sum of the lengths of both pieces must equal 40 feet.
   
   So,
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 5 to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

5. **Find the Length of the Longest Piece:**
   Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece, we substitute \( x = 8 \) back into the expression for the longer piece:
   \[
   \text{Longer piece} = 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

### Conclusion:
The length of the longer piece is **32** feet.<|im_end|>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.
The two pieces are 4x and x in length.
The equation is 4x + x = 40 when the lengths of the two boards are added.

Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the amount of seasoning needed per meatball:**
   - We know that Aiden needs 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - He makes 16 meatballs from each pound of meat.

Let's calculate the total number of meatballs he can make from one pound of ground beef:
\[ \text{Number of meatballs per pound} = 16 \]

Now, let's find out how many tablespoons of seasoning are required for these meatballs. Since there are 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound, we divide the total number of meatballs by 16 (since there are 16 meatballs in each pound):
\[ \text{Tablespoons of seasoning per pound} = \frac{2}{16} \]
\[ \text{Tablespoons of seasoning per pound} = 0.125 \]

This means Aiden requires 0.125 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef.

2. **Calculate the total amount of seasoning needed for 80 meatballs:**
   - To determine the total amount of seasoning needed for 80 meatballs, we multiply the number of meatballs by the seasoning requirement per meatball:
\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = 80 \times 0.125 \]
\[ \text{Total seasoning needed} = 10 \]

Therefore, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs for the cookout.

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Let's check if the calculations align with the given information.
     - For 4 pounds of meat, he would use \(4 \times 0.125 = 0.5\) tablespoons of seasoning.
     - For 80 meatballs, he would need \(80 \times 0.125 = 10\) tablespoons of seasoning.

Since both calculations match our earlier findings, the final answer is correct.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","To make 80 meatballs, Aiden will need 80 / 16 = <<80/16=5>>5 pounds of meat.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fabric Luke should buy based on the given information about the widths of the windows.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total width of all the windows:**
   - There are five windows.
   - Each window is 35 inches wide.
   
   \[
   \text{Total width} = \text{Number of windows} \times \text{Width per window}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine how much fabric is needed:**
   - Luke needs to buy fabric that is equal in area to 2 times the total width of the windows.
   
   \[
   \text{Fabric required} = 2 \times \text{Total width}
   \]
   
   Substituting the calculated total width:

   \[
   \text{Fabric required} = 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ square inches}
   \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 square inches of fabric.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes.
- The initial rate is $0.25 per minute.
- For the first 16 minutes, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Cost} = 0.25 \times 16
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Cost} = 4
\]

So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is $4.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining time after the first 16 minutes.
- Total call duration is 36 minutes.
- Time already used (first 16 minutes) is 16 minutes.

Subtracting these from the total call duration:

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = 36 - 16
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining 20 minutes at the reduced rate.
- The reduced rate is $0.20 per minute.
- For the remaining 20 minutes, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Cost} = 0.20 \times 20
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Cost} = 4
\]

So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is $4.00.

### Step 4: Add both costs together to get the total cost.
- Cost for the first 16 minutes is $4.00.
- Cost for the remaining 20 minutes is $4.00.

Adding these amounts gives:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the 36-minute call is **$8.00**.

### Final Answer: The final answer is $8.00.<|im_end|>","First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.
After that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.
So in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of treats per person**: Each of the 5 people in Carly's class will receive 2 treats.
   - Total treats = 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

2. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of brownies.

3. **Set up equations based on the information given**:
   - The problem states that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
     This can be written as: 
       \( B = 3C + 2 \)
   
4. **Calculate the total number of treats**: Since each of the 5 people receives 2 treats, we have:
      \( 2C + 2B = 10 \)

5. **Substitute the expression from equation (2) into equation (4)**:
   Substitute \( B = 3C + 2 \) into \( 2C + 2B = 10 \):
   \[
   2C + 2(3C + 2) = 10
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   2C + 6C + 4 = 10
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   8C + 4 = 10
   \]

6. **Solve for \( C \)**:
   Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the term with \( C \):
   \[
   8C = 6
   \]
   Divide both sides by 8 to find \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

Therefore, Carly made \( \frac{3}{4} \) cupcakes.

However, since the number of cupcakes must be an integer, and our calculations suggest otherwise, there might be an error or misunderstanding in the problem statement. Please double-check the problem details if you need further assistance.<|im_end|>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats

We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

                    A basic ; manicure starts at $35 , while a pedicure starts at $40. A . certain salon offers 20% off if : you get , both. Suppose Karen chooses ? to do ? both and would ? also : like to add nail art on each . of her fingers, which . costs , $3 : per ; nail. How much would she pay : in all?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total cost for one basic manicure + one pedicure.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both services together.
3. Add the cost of the nail art ($3) to the discounted total.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for one basic manicure + one pedicure.
- Basic manicure = $35
- Pedi = $40
- Total before discount = $35 + $40 = $75

Step 2: Apply the 20% discount.
- Discount amount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
- Discounted total = $75 - $15 = $60

Step 3: Add the cost of the nail art.
- Cost of nail art = $3
- Final total = $60 + $3 = $63

Therefore, Karen would pay $63 in total for her services including the nail art.

{The final answer is} $63<|im_end|>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many magazines Susan gets each year, we need to calculate the total number of issues from all three magazines.

1. **Calculate the total number of issues from the first magazine:**
   - The first magazine sends 12 issues per year.
   - Susan buys 3 such magazines.
   - Therefore, the total number of issues from these 3 magazines is \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of issues from the second magazine:**
   - The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.
   - Susan buys 1 such magazine.
   - Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of issues from the third magazine:**
   - The third magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine.
   - Since the 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues per year, the third magazine sends \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) issues per year.
   - Susan buys 1 such magazine.
   - Therefore, the total number of issues from this magazine is \( 1 \times 24 = 24 \).

4. **Sum up the total number of issues from all three magazines:**
   - Total issues from the first magazine: 36
   - Total issues from the second magazine: 6
   - Total issues from the third magazine: 24
   - Therefore, the total number of issues from all three magazines is \( 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many paintings Shelley has.
We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.

Given:
- Samantha = 27 paintings
- Samantha has 12 fewer than Shelley

Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.

From the information given:
\[ S - 12 = 27 \]

Solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

So, Shelley has **39** paintings.

### Step 2: Determine how many paintings Kim has.
We also know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.

Given:
- Shelley = 39 paintings
- Shelley has 8 more than Kim

Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.

From the information given:
\[ S = K + 8 \]

Substitute \( S \) from Step 1:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Solve for \( K \):
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

So, Kim has **31** paintings.

To determine the final price of the toy after discounts in both November and December, we need to follow these steps:

1. **November:**
   - The initial price of the toy in November is given as $40.
   - No discount is mentioned for November.

2. **December:**
   - The price increases by 80% from November's price.
   - Calculate the increase amount: \( \text{Increase} = \text{Initial Price} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100} \)
     \[
     \text{Increase} = \$40 \times \frac{80}{100} = \$32
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original price to get the new price in December:
     \[
     \text{Price in December} = \$40 + \$32 = \$72
     \]

3. **January:**
   - The price decreases by 50% from December's price.
   - Calculate the decrease amount: \( \text{Decrease} = \text{New Price} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Decrease}}{100} \)
     \[
     \text{Decrease} = \$72 \times \frac{50}{100} = \$36
     \]
   - Subtract this decrease from the December price to find the final price in January:
     \[
     \text{Price in January} = \$72 - \$36 = \$36
     \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after being discounted in January is \boxed{36}.<|im_end|>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Charlie's reduced lesson rate for veterans.
Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. When he gives lessons to a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%.

- Reduction percentage = 25%
- Reduced rate = Standard rate * (1 - Reduction percentage)
  
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$80 \times (1 - 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$80 \times 0.75 \]
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from regular lessons.
Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at his standard rate.

- Number of hours = 4
- Standard rate = $80/hour
- Total earnings from regular lessons = Number of hours × Standard rate

\[ \text{Total Earnings from Regular Lessons} = 4 \times \$80 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings from Regular Lessons} = \$320 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from veteran lessons.
Charlie has 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran.

- Number of hours = 2
- Reduced rate = $60/hour
- Total earnings from veteran lessons = Number of hours × Reduced rate

\[ \text{Total Earnings from Veteran Lessons} = 2 \times \$60 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings from Veteran Lessons} = \$120 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all earnings.
- Total earnings from regular lessons = $320
- Total earnings from veteran lessons = $120
- Total earnings for the day = Total earnings from regular lessons + Total earnings from veteran lessons

\[ \text{Total Earnings for the Day} = \$320 + \$120 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings for the Day} = \$440 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{\$440}$.<|im_end|>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.

Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

<|im_start|>super
To find Sally's mean (average) score on her math quizzes, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of all scores.**
First, let's add up all the scores provided.

Scores: 
50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60

Sum = 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60

Let's break this down:
- Start with 50 and add it to 80: \(50 + 80 = 130\)
- Add another 80: \(130 + 80 = 210\)
- Continue adding more numbers: \(210 + 60 = 270\)
- Then, add 90: \(270 + 90 = 360\)
- Next, add 100: \(360 + 100 = 460\)
- Finally, add 70: \(460 + 70 = 530\)
- And lastly, add 60: \(530 + 60 = 590\)

So, the total sum of the scores is **590**.

**Step 2: Count the number of scores.**
There are 9 scores in total.

**Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of scores to get the mean.**
Mean score = Sum / Number of scores
Mean score = 590 / 9

Now, perform the division:
\[ \frac{590}{9} \approx 65.56 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is approximately **65.56**.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** The mean score is **65.56**.<|im_end|>","Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine what fraction of the original number Eve has left.
Eve has 20 pomelos initially, and she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of them.

\[
\text{Number of pomelos left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos after giving some away.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pomelos Eve gave away.
We know that before giving any away, Eve had 20 pomelos. If she now has 5 pomelos, then the difference between these two amounts will tell us how many were given away.

\[
\text{Pomelos given away} = \text{Original number} - \text{Remaining number}
\]
\[
\text{Pomelos given away} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

2. Determine how many apples are left after eating some.
3. Calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister.
4. Find out how many apples are left after giving some to his sister.
5. Calculate how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate how many apples Walter ate
Walter ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the apples. Since he bought 60 apples initially:
\[ \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many apples are left after eating some
After eating 24 apples, the remaining number of apples is:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister
Walter gave his sister \( 25\% \) of the remaining apples (which were 36):
\[ \text{Apples given to sister} = \frac{25}{100} \times 36 = 9 \]

### Step 4: Find out how many apples are left after giving some to his sister
After giving 9 apples to his sister, the remaining number of apples is:
\[ 36 - 9 = 27 \]

### Step 5: Calculate how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples
Walter sells the remaining 27 apples for $3 each:
\[ \text{Money received} = 27 \times 3 = \$81 \]

So, the total amount of money Walter received is:

   - Regina wrote 9 novels in one year.
   
2. **Calculate the number of novels she will write this year:**
   - Since this is ! 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote last year, we need to calculate three-quarters of 9.
   - First, find three-quarters of 9: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 9 = \frac{27}{4} = 6.75 \).

3. **Sum the novels from both years:**
   - Add the number of novels she wrote last year (9) to the number she plans to write this year (6.75).
   - Total = \( 9 + 6.75 = 15.75 \).

So, Regina has written a total of 15.75 novels over two years.

<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of the total distance that Michael has traveled, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total time Michael will spend driving:**
   - We know that Michael travels at an average speed of 50 km/hr.
   - The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km.
   - To find the total time spent driving, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{6000 \text{ km}}{50 \text{ km/hr}} = 120 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of days Michael spends driving:**
   - Michael drives for 3 days.

3. **Convert the total time spent driving into minutes or seconds if needed for accuracy, but it’s already in hours for simplicity.**

4. **Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered:**
   - Since Michael drives for 3 days at a constant speed, we can assume he covers the same amount of distance each day.
   - Therefore, the distance covered per day is:
     \[
     \text{Distance per Day} = \text{Average Speed} \times \text{Time Spent Driving Per Day}
     \]
     Assuming Michael drives for the same duration every day:
     \[
     \text{Distance per Day} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 120 \text{ hours/day} = 6000 \text{ km/day}
     \]
   - Over 3 days:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance Covered} = 6000 \text{ km/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18000 \text{ km}
     \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered:**
   - The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km.
   - The percentage of the total distance covered is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Covered}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{18000 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100\% = 300\%

                    question:
                    Madeline ate 6 : grapes. Her . brother wanted to : make grape juice . and used up 5 times as ? many : grapes then Madeline to . make a full glass. Their mother then used , the remaining grapes ! to make ? 4 . pies. ; How , many grapes were there at . the beginning if the pie recipe ? calls for 12 , grapes per pie?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used
Madeline ate 6 grapes.
Her brother made grape juice using 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Grapes used by brother} = 5 \times (\text{Grains eaten by Madeline}) \]
\[ \text{Grapes used by brother} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many grapes were left after making juice
Since her brother used 30 grapes to make grape juice, we subtract that from the total number of grapes Madeline had initially (which was 6):

\[ \text{Remaining grapes} = \text{Total grapes} - \text{Grapes used by brother} \]
\[ \text{Remaining grapes} = 6 - 30 = -24 \]

This result doesn't make sense because you can't have negative grapes. Let's re-evaluate our approach since we seem to have misunderstood something in the initial calculation.

### Step 3: Correctly determine the total number of grapes used by Madeline's brother
We need to find out how many grapes his brother actually needed to use to make grape juice enough to fill 4 pies, where each pie requires 12 grapes.

For 4 pies:
\[ \text{Total grapes required for 4 pies} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, considering he used 5 times more than what Madeline ate, we need to calculate the correct amount:

\[ \text{Total grapes used by brother} = 5 \times \text{(grapes eaten by Madeline)} \]
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

This means his brother only needed 30 grapes for 4 pies but still used them all for grape juice. This indicates an error in the original setup or interpretation. Let's correct it.

### Step 4: Recalculate correctly based on the new understanding
Given the brother's requirement for grape juice to fill 4 pies, which is 48 grapes, we know:
\[ \text{Total grapes used by brother} = 5 \times \text{(grapes eaten by Madeline)} \]
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

But since the brother filled 4 pies with juice, he must have used exactly 48 grapes for those pies. So:
\[ \text{Total grapes used by brother} = 48 \]

### Step 5: Determine the initial number of grapes
Since his brother used 48 grapes to make juice for 4 pies, and he did so without needing any additional grapes beyond what Madeline already had, we conclude that the initial number of grapes must be sufficient to cover the 48 grapes he used for juice.

Therefore, the initial number of grapes should equal the 48 grapes he used plus whatever was left over after eating 6 grapes himself.

Let \( G \) represent the initial number of grapes:
\[ G = 48 + 6 = 54 \]

### Final Answer:
The initial number of grapes was **54**.<|im_end|>","Madeline's brother used 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 grapes

<|im_start|>west
To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School on that particular day, we need to consider both the number of regular teachers present and the number of substitute teachers who attended.

1. **Identify the total number of teachers**:
   - On that day, there were 13 teachers present.
   
2. **Account for the number of substitute teachers**:
   - Substitute teachers came to help: 9 substitute teachers.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of teachers including substitutes**:
   - Add the number of regular teachers to the number of substitute teachers:
     \[
     13 \text{ (regular teachers)} + 9 \text{ (substitute teachers)} = 22 \text{ (total teachers)}
     \]

4. **Verify the calculation**:
   - We can double-check this by ensuring it doesn't exceed the total number of teachers available at the school. Since 22 is less than or equal to 82, our addition is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of teachers at school on that day was 22.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break down his spending step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Spending
First, we need to find out how much Bud spends on ingredients per meal.

- Pasta cost per box: $1.00
- Cheddar cheese cost: $3.00 (he uses this amount)
- Gruyère cheese cost: twice the amount of cheddar cheese = $6.00 (since he uses it twice)

Total weekly cost calculation:

\[
\text{Weekly Cost} = \text{Pasta Cost} + \text{Cheddar Cheese Cost} + \text{Gruyère Cheese Cost}
\]

\[
= \$1.00 + \$3.00 + \$6.00
\]

\[
= \$10.00
\]

So, Bud spends **$10.00** on ingredients per meal.

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Spending
Now, we need to calculate how much Bud spends over an entire year.

\[
\text{Annual Cost} = \text{Weekly Cost} \times \text{Number of Meals Per Year}
\]

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so there are 52 weeks in a year.

\[
\text{Number of Meals Per Year} = 52
\]

\[
\text{Annual Cost} = \$10.00 \times 52
\]

\[
= \$520.00
\]

Therefore, Bud spends **$520.00** on making macaroni and cheese in one year.<|im_end|>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

                    question:
                    A custodian has to clean : a . school with ! 80 classrooms. They have 5 days to get . it done. ; It takes ? them ? 15 ? minutes per , classroom. If they work an 8 hour day, , what percentage . of their day, on average, is ! spent cleaning classrooms?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of classroom cleaning tasks required.
- The custodian needs to clean all 80 classrooms.
- Each classroom requires one cleaning task.

Therefore, the total number of cleaning tasks = 80 classrooms.

### Step 2: Determine how many cleaning tasks can be completed in one day.
- There are 5 days available for cleaning.
- Each cleaning task takes 15 minutes.

First, calculate the total time (in minutes) that can be spent cleaning in one day:

\[ \text{Total cleaning time per day} = \text{Number of cleaning tasks/day} \times \text{Time per task} \]

Since there are 80 cleaning tasks and each task takes 15 minutes:

\[ \text{Total cleaning time per day} = 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours.
There are 60 minutes in one hour.

\[ \text{Total cleaning time per day in hours} = \frac{1200}{60} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent cleaning over the 5-day period.
\[ \text{Total cleaning time over 5 days} = 20 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 100 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount of time worked during these 5 days.
Each day works for an 8-hour shift.

\[ \text{Total working time} = 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of time spent cleaning.
\[ \text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning time}}{\text{Total working time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{100 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = 2.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = 250\% \]

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of each shelf.
- **Bottom shelf**: Can hold \(10\) books.
- **Middle shelf**: Can hold \(10\) books.
- **Top shelf**: Can hold \(5\) fewer books than the bottom shelf.

Given that the bottom shelf holds \(10\) books, then the top shelf will hold:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ books} \]

### Step 2: Calculate total books per shelf combination.
Each shelf (bottom, middle, and top) can hold \(10\), \(10\), and \(5\) books respectively.

So, for one complete shelf setup:
\[ 10 + 10 + 5 = 25 \text{ books} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many sets of shelves fit into the total number of books.
Elly has \(110\) books in total. To find out how many sets of these shelves she needs to hold all her books, divide the total number of books by the number of books each set can hold.

\[ \frac{110}{25} = 4.4 \]

Since she cannot have a fraction of a shelf, she needs at least \(5\) full sets of shelves to accommodate all her books.

### Step 4: Verify the calculation.
If she uses \(5\) sets of shelves:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ books} \]
This means \(5\) sets would hold \(125\) books, which is more than enough.

However, if she only used \(4\) sets:
\[ 4 \times 25 = 100 \text{ books} \]
This would be insufficient since she needs \(110\) books.

Therefore, Elly needs exactly \(5\) full sets of shelves to hold all her books.

### Conclusion:
Elly needs \(\boxed{5}\) bookcases to hold all \(110\) books.<|im_end|>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying the eggs.
Rose buys 5 dozens of eggs.

- One dozen = 12 eggs
- Therefore, 5 dozens = \( 5 \times 12 = 60 \) eggs

Cost per dozen at market price:
\[ \$2.40 \]

Total cost (for 60 eggs):
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \times \$2.40 \text{ per dozen} = \$144 \]

### Step 2: Determine the selling price per egg.
Rose plans to sell her eggs for $1 per 3 eggs.

- Number of eggs in 3 units:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ eggs}}{1 \text{ unit}} \]

Price per 3 eggs:
\[ \$1 \]

Selling price per egg:
\[ \frac{\$1}{\frac{3 \text{ eggs}}{1 \text{ unit}}} = \frac{\$1}{3} \approx \$0.33 \text{ per egg} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all eggs.
Total number of eggs sold:
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Revenue from selling eggs:
\[ 60 \text{ eggs} \times \$0.33 \text{ per egg} = \$19.80 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

\[ \text{Profit} = \$19.80 - \$144 \]
\[ \text{Profit} = -\$124.20 \]

### Conclusion:
Rose’s profit will be negative because she is not making any profit; instead, she will incur a loss of **$124.20**. The final answer is:
{The final answer is}
The final answer is: -$124.20<|im_end|>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white hats Skyler has based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of red hats.
Skyler has 100 hats in total. According to the problem, half of these hats are red.

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining hats after removing the red ones.
After removing the red hats, the remaining number of hats is:

\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of blue hats.
According to the problem, three-fifths of the remaining hats are blue.

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of white hats.
Since the remaining hats must be either red or blue (as per the initial conditions), we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.

\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (\text{Number of red hats} + \text{Number of blue hats}) \]
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (50 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of white hats} = 20 \]

To determine the cost per stick of jerky, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bags purchased.
Archie bought one bag of beef jerky for $18.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the original price per stick.
We know that there are 30 sticks in each bag. Therefore, we can calculate the original price per stick as follows:

\[ \text{Original Price per Stick} = \frac{\text{Total Original Cost}}{\text{Number of Sticks per Bag}} \]

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ \text{Original Price per Stick} = \frac{18.00}{30} \]

### Step 3: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Original Price per Stick} = \frac{18.00}{30} = 0.60 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

### Step 4: Adjust for the discount.
Archie receives a $3.00 off on his purchase. This means he only pays for two-thirds of the total cost because the third part would have been free due to the discount.

So, he effectively pays for \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total cost.

\[ \text{Effective Cost per Stick} = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} \times \text{Original Price per Stick} \]

### Step 5: Simplify the fraction.
\[ \text{Effective Cost per Stick} = \frac{3}{2} \times 0.60 \]

### Step 6: Perform the multiplication.
\[ \text{Effective Cost per Stick} = 1.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

### Step 7: Convert the effective cost per stick to cents.
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the cost from dollars to cents:

\[ \text{Effective Cost per Stick (in cents)} = 1.50 \times 100 = 150 \text{ cents} \]

### Final Answer:
Each stick of jerky will cost \(\boxed{150}\) cents.<|im_end|>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

   - Since she already answered 42 out of 70 questions correctly in the first test, she still needs to answer more questions correctly.

   \[
   \text{Remaining questions needed} = 49 - 42 = 7
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the total questions in the second test that she needs to correctly answer:**
   - The second test has 40 questions.

   \[
   \text{Percentage for the second test} = \left(\frac{7}{40}\right) \times 100\%

                    question:
                    Mary is making ice cubes . with , fruit frozen in ! them ? for a cocktail party. She makes some , strawberry cubes, and a ; number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times ! the . number of . strawberry cubes minus 4. If ; she ? makes . 116 : ice cubes total, how many blueberry ? cubes ? does she make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of strawberry cubes.
   
2. **Set up the equation based on the given information about blueberries:**
   According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes equals 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.
   So, if \( x \) is the number of strawberry cubes, then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5x - 4 \).

3. **Write the total number of cubes:**
   The total number of ice cubes made (strawberry + blueberry) is 116.
   Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   x + (5x - 4) = 116
   \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + 5x - 4 = 116
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   6x - 4 = 116
   \]
   Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   6x = 120
   \]
   Divide by 6:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

5. **Find the number of blueberry cubes:**
   Substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the expression for blueberry cubes:
   \[
   5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96
   \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes she makes is 96.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 96.<|im_end|>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.
Substituting the first equation into the second, we get s + 5s - 4 = 116.
Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

To solve this problem, let's break down Brendan's actions step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Count
Brendan starts with 10 marbles in his bag.

\[
\text{Initial count} = 10 \text{ marbles}
\]

### Step 2: Dropping Marbles
While walking, Brendan drops half of the marbles:

\[
\text{Marbles dropped} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ marbles}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining marbles after dropping} = 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ marbles}

So, Brendan ends up with 5 marbles before anything happens.

\[
\text{Count after dropping} = 5 \text{ marbles}
\]

### Step 3: Finding Marbles Again
After some time, Brendan finds 3 more marbles.

\[
\text{New count} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ marbles}
\]

Now, Brendan has 8 marbles.

\[
\text{Count after finding additional marbles} = 8 \text{ marbles}
\]

### Step 4: Removing an Irrelevant Item
Brendan picks up one bead that was not a marble.

\[
\text{Final count} = 8 - 1 = 7 \text{ marbles}
\]

Therefore, Brendan ends up with 7 marbles.

\[
\boxed{7 \text{ marbles}}

                    question:
                    Jason works as a , salesperson at a . car dealership.  He . needs to sell 15 ! cars . this ! month to earn a big bonus.  He knows : based ; on . historical ! averages, : that for every ! 25 telephone ; calls he . makes to potential customers, he gets ; one person ; to come : into the car dealership to look at ! new cars.

Jason need to make ! to sell 15 , cars and earn his bonus?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we'll break down the information given:

1. **Total Cars to Sell**: Jason aims to sell 15 cars.

2. **Call-to-Visit Ratio**: For every 25 telephone calls made, one customer comes into the dealership.
   
3. **Customer-to-Sell Ratio**: For every 2 customers who visit the dealership, one buys a car.

Let's start by calculating the number of visits needed from the call-to-visit ratio:

- Since Jason needs 1 out of every 25 calls to get someone interested, we can set up a proportion based on the total number of visits required.

\[ \text{Number of Calls} = \frac{\text{Number of Visits Needed}}{\text{Calls per Visit}} \]

We know that 1 out of every 25 calls leads to a visit:

\[ \text{Number of Calls} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)} \]

Simplifying the expression gives us:

\[ \text{Number of Calls} = 25 \]

So, Jason needs 25 calls just to reach 15 visitors.

Next, let’s calculate the number of customers Jason should aim to see based on the number of visits:

Since Jason needs 1 visitor for every 2 customers:

\[ \text{Number of Customers} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Visitors} \]

Substituting in our value for visitors (which we found to be 25):

\[ \text{Number of Customers} = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 = 12.5 \]

Therefore, Jason needs to see approximately 12.5 customers. 

Now, since he needs to convert these visitors into actual sales:

For every 2 customers visiting, one buys a car.

Thus,

\[ \text{Number of Sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of Customers} \]

Substitute the number of visitors we calculated:

\[ \text{Number of Sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12.5 = 6.25 \]

So, Jason needs to aim to sell around 6.25 cars. However, he must sell an integer number of cars. Given the context, it seems like there might be some rounding or adjustment needed. If he wants to ensure he sells whole cars, he would need to round up to the next whole number.

Therefore, Jason needs to sell 7 cars to meet his goal (rounding up).

In conclusion, Jason needs to make approximately **7** telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.<|im_end|>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.
Since Jason needs to make 25 telephone calls to get one person to come into the dealership, to get 30 customers, Jason must make 25*30=<<25*30=750>>750 telephone calls.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family will use during the blackout. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights needed
- Each person needs a flashlight.
- There are 4 people (Brianna + her parents + her siblings).

So, the total number of flashlights required = \(4 \times 1 = 4\)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flashlights per room
- There are 2 flashlights per room.

Since there are 8 rooms in the house:

Total number of flashlights = \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

### Step 3: Calculate the number of candles needed
- Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium-sized candles each.

For the first half (half of 8 rooms):
\[ \frac{8}{2} \times 4 = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

For the second half (other half of 8 rooms):
\[ \frac{8}{2} \times 5 = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

### Step 4: Add up all the candles
Total number of candles = \(16 \text{(small)} + 20 \text{(medium)} = 36\)

### Final Answer
When the lights go out, Brianna's family will be using **36 candles** and **16 flashlights**.<|im_end|>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.
For every person there is 1 flashlight, 1 x 4 people = <<1*4=4>>4 flashlights.
Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.
Combined, there are 20 flashlights + 36 candles = <<20+36=56>>56 flashlights and candles in the house.

   - Mitchell buys two bags of chips.
   - Each bag contains 55 chips.
   - Therefore, the total number of chips is \(2 \times 55 = 110\).

2. **Determine the number of people in the family:**
   - The family consists of five members.

3. **Divide the total number of chips by the number of people:**
   - To find out how many chips each person gets, divide the total number of chips (110) by the number of people (5).

To determine how long it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to break down the time taken for each side and then sum them up.

1. **Time for the first side:**
   - John takes 5 minutes to complete this side.
   
2. **Time for the second side:**
   - The second side takes twice as long as the first side.
   - Time = \( 5 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Time for the third side:**
   - Similarly, the third side also takes twice as long as the first side.
   - Time = \( 5 \text{ minutes} \times 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \).

4. **Time for the fourth side:**
   - The fourth side takes half as long as the first side.
   - Time = \( 5 \text{ minutes} / 2 = 2.5 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Time for the fifth side:**
   - Once you reach the fifth side, you have solved the entire cube.
   - Time = 0 minutes (since it’s already done).

Now, let’s calculate the total time:

- First side: 5 minutes
- Second side: 10 minutes
- Third side: 10 minutes
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes
- Fifth side: 0 minutes

Total time = \( 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 0 \) minutes.

Adding these together gives us:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 0 = 27.5 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the Rubik's cube takes a total of 27.5 minutes to be fully solved.<|im_end|>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 20 helmets.

2. **Calculate the number of footballs:**
   - According to the problem, Dominick saw half as many footballs as he did helmets.
   - Number of footballs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of helmets
   - Number of footballs = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20\)
   - Number of footballs = 10

3. **Calculate the number of robots:**
   - The problem states that Dominick saw half as many robots as he did helmets.
   - Number of robots = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of helmets
   - Number of robots = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 20\)
   - Number of robots = 10

4. **Sum up all the items:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total working time**
Tim works for 6 hours every day.

- Total working hours per day = 6 hours/day

Since there are 24 hours in a full day, we need to find out how many days make up one week.
- Number of working days in a week = 7 days/week

Now, calculate the total number of working hours in one week:
\[ \text{Total working hours} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Total working hours} = 42 \text{ hours/week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of calls Tim deals with daily**
It takes Tim 15 minutes to deal with one call.

Convert the total working hours from Step 1 into minutes:
\[ 42 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 2520 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, divide the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call:
\[ \text{Number of calls per day} = \frac{\text{Total working minutes}}{\text{Time per call}} \]
\[ \text{Number of calls per day} = \frac{2520 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} \]
\[ \text{Number of calls per day} = 168 \text{ calls/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls over 5 days**
Multiply the number of calls per day by the number of working days in a week:
\[ \text{Total calls in 5 days} = \text{Number of calls per day} \times \text{Number of working days in a week} \]

                    question:
                    Louise is an ! artist and ? needs to : apply a coat of varnish ? to . her latest paintings. Usually it : takes 7 minutes for the ? coat of varnish : to dry ? on , one painting.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry when using the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the drying time per painting for both types of varnishes:**
   - For the old varnish (7 minutes):
     \[
     \text{Total time for 6 paintings} = 6 \times 7 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Old varnish total time} = 42 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - For the new varnish (12 minutes):
     \[
     \text{Total time for 6 paintings} = 6 \times 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{New varnish total time} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Find the difference in total drying times between the two methods:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{New varnish total time} - \text{Old varnish total time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Conclusion:**

It will take 30 more minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on six paintings using the new varnish compared to the old varnish.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30 \text{ minutes}}
\]<|im_end|>","Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much water Crista needs to water all her plants every day, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of plants**: 20
2. **Plants needing half a cup of water**:
   - Number of such plants: 4
3. **Plants needing one-quarter of a cup of water**:
   - Number of such plants: \(20 - 4 = 16\)
4. **Plants needing two-thirds of a cup of water**:
   - Number of such plants: 0 (since this option isn't explicitly mentioned in the given data)

Now we can calculate the total amount of water needed per day based on the type of plant that needs the most water.

- For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water per day:
  \[
  4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
  \]

- For the 16 plants that need one-third of a cup of water per day:
  \[
  16 \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \text{ cups}
  \]

Since the third group of plants doesn’t contribute significantly to the total (as they need only one-third of a cup), it can be ignored for our calculation.

Therefore, the total amount of water needed per day is approximately equal to the amount required by the plants needing half a cup of water since these are the majority of her plants.
  
So, Crista needs approximately **2 cups of water** every day to meet the watering requirements of her plants.<|im_end|>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups
She will need 8 cups for the plants that need a cup of water because 1*8= <<1*8=8>>8 cups.
Since she has 20 plants, 20-4-8=<<20-4-8=8>>8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break down the journey into two parts: one part on land and another part in water. We need to calculate the time taken for each part separately and then sum them up.

### Part 1: Hopping on Land
Phineas needs to cover 200 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
- Time = Distance / Speed
- Time on land = \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} \)
- Time on land = 10 minutes

### Part 2: Swimming Through Water
Half of the total distance (which is 200 yards) is in water.
- Distance in water = \( \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \)
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute
- Time in water = \( \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} \)
- Time in water = 10 minutes

### Total Time
Now, let's add the time spent hopping on land and swimming in water:
\[ \text{Total time} = 10 \text{ minutes (on land)} + 10 \text{ minutes (in water)} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it will take Phineas to return home is **20 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

To determine how much it will cost Bob to recreate the Washington Monument using popsicle sticks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks needed:**
   - Bob wants to create the Washington Monument.
   - Each popsicle stick represents one part of the monument's structure.

2. **Determine the total number of boxes required:**
   - Bob has 56 popsicle sticks available.
   - Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks.

3. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total popsicle sticks}}{\text{Popsicle sticks per box}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56}{8}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = 7
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**

   - Therefore, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes by the cost per box.

6. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7 \times 2.00
   \]

7. **Perform the multiplication again:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 14.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationship between the main phone and each additional phone:**
   - Let \( M \) be the cost of the main phone.
   - Let \( A \) be the cost of one additional phone.

2. **Determine the given information:**
   - The main phone costs twice as much as an additional phone: \( M = 2A \).

3. **Given the total cost for the plan:**
   - We know that the total cost of the plan includes both the main phone and four additional phones.
   - The total cost is $20.

4. **Express the total cost in terms of \( A \):**
   - The total cost can be written as: 
     \[
     M + 4A = 20
     \]
     Substituting \( M = 2A \):
     \[
     2A + 4A = 20
     \]

5. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6A = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6 to isolate \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3}
     \]

6. **Calculate the cost of the main phone \( M \):**
   - Using \( M = 2A \):
     \[
     M = 2 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total cost of the plan:**
   - Substitute back into the equation \( M + 4A = 20 \):
     \[
     \frac{20}{3} + 4 \times \frac{10}{3} = 20
     \]
     Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \frac{20}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = 20
     \]
     Add the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the total cost of the plan is $20.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The total cost of the phone plan is $20}.<|im_end|>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.

To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling his doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in one day.
Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.

- One dozen = 12 doughnuts
- Therefore, 10 dozen = \( 10 \times 12 \) doughnuts

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of doughnuts made in June.
June typically has 30 days.

- Number of doughnuts per day = 120
- Total doughnuts for June = \( 120 \times 30 \)

\[ 120 \times 30 = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all doughnuts.
Each doughnut is sold for $2.

- Revenue per doughnut = $2
- Total revenue for all doughnuts = \( 3600 \times 2 \)

\[ 3600 \times 2 = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Derrick makes a total of $7200 in June from selling all the doughnuts.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and perform the calculations step-by-step.

1. **Determine the new speaking speed:**
   - John’s normal speaking speed is 150 WPM.
   - After training, his speed increases by 2.5 times.
   
   Calculation for increased speed:
   \[
   \text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5 = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:**
   - Each page contains 450 words.
   - Number of pages: 10
   
   Total words in 10 pages:
   \[
   \text{Total Words} = \text{Words per Page} \times \text{Number of Pages} = 450 \times 10 = 4500 \text{ words}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required at the new speed:**
   - New speaking speed: 375 WPM
   - Time (in seconds) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time (seconds)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
     
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Time (seconds)} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ seconds}
   \]

So, it would take John 12 seconds to speak all 10 pages of text.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Conor lives near a ! beach and loves going there , every day to ? have fun. ? On ? a , particular week, : he ? found 50 people . at the beach on the first day.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. **Number of people on the first day**: 50
2. **Number of people on the second day**: 70 (since it was 20 more than the first day)
3. **Number of people on the third day**: Twice the number from the second day = 70 * 2 = 140
4. **Average number of people per day for the rest of the week**: 60
5. **Total number of days in the week excluding the three specified days**: Let's assume the rest of the weeks are 7 days long.

Now let's sum up all the numbers:
- First day: 50
- Second day: 70
- Third day: 140
- Rest of the days: \(7 \times 60 = 420\)

So, the total number of people Conor saw over those seven days is:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 420 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \]
\[ 120 + 140 = 260 \]
\[ 260 + 420 = 680 \]

Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach during that week is **680**.<|im_end|>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people
The third day, the total number of people at the beach was twice the number on the second day: thus, 2 * 70 people = <<70*2=140>>140 people
For the remaining days of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people per day, for a total of 60 people/day * 4 days = <<60*4=240>>240 people
Conor saw a total of 240 people + 140 people + 70 people + 50 people = <<240+140+70+50=500>>500 people

                    question:
                    ; Garrett . is ! popping popcorn ; for a snack. , As the : pan ; of kernels heats , up, the kernels : start , popping faster.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Popping Rate Calculation:**
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
   - This is an initial rate of \( \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3} \) kernel per second.

2. **Popping Rate Increase Over Time:**
   - Next, in the next 30 seconds, three times the amount of kernels pop compared to the initial rate.
     - Three times the initial rate: \( 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \) kernels per second.
     - Total popping over the next 30 seconds: \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) kernels.
   
3. **Rate at the End of the Final 30 Seconds:**
   - At the end of the final 30 seconds, the rate decreases to half the previous rate.
     - Half of the initial rate: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \) kernel per second.
     - Total popping during this time: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 30 = 10 \) kernels.

4. **Residual Heat Popping:**
   - After taking off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop again.
     - Number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds: 10.
     - Residual popping: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 10 = 2.5 \approx 2 \) kernels (assuming whole numbers).

5. **Total Popcorn Popped:**
   - Total popper: Initial 20 kernels + Next 60 kernels + Final 10 kernels + Residual 2 kernels.
     - Total popper: \( 20 + 60 + 10 + 2 = 92 \).

Therefore, Garrett has eaten 92 pieces of popcorn. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 92.<|im_end|>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade needed:**
   - Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade.

2. **Determine how much lemon juice is required per gallon:**
   - According to the recipe, 1 cup of fresh lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon of lemonade.

3. **Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons:**
   - Since 1 cup of lemon juice is needed for 1 gallon, 4 gallons will require \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of lemon juice.

4. **Determine the number of lemons needed based on the amount of lemon juice:**
   - It is given that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, the number of lemons needed for 4 cups of juice can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of lemons} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{1 \text{ cup per 6 lemons}} = 24 \text{ lemons}
     \]

5. **Consider Allen's request for extra lemonade that is twice as tart as the others:**
   - The original batch of 4 gallons requires 24 lemons.
   - For Allen's extra gallon, we need twice as much lemon juice, so he needs \(2 \times 4 = 8\) cups of lemon juice (since \(4 \text{ cups per gallon} \times 2 = 8 \text{ cups}\)).
   - To match the tartness, Allen also needs twice the number of lemons in the original batch because tartness correlates with the quantity of lemon juice used. Hence, Allen will need \(2 \times 24 = 48\) lemons.

**Final Answer:**
Tim will need **24 lemons** for the main batch and **48 lemons** for the extra gallon that is twice as tart as the others.<|im_end|>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch
In addition, he will make 4 regular gallons of lemonade, which each need 1 cup juice so 4*1 = <<4*1=4>>4 cups total
All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the daily consumption for all dogs.
First, let's calculate how much dog food one German Shepherd needs per day. Then, multiply that by the number of German Shepherds to get the total daily consumption.

- Each German Shepherd eats **5 kg/day**.
- There are **3 German Shepherds**.

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Number of GS} \times \text{GS daily consumption} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 3 \times 5 \, \text{kg/day} \]

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 15 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, add up the daily consumption for all dogs:

- Total daily consumption = **15 kg/day**

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly consumption.
Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7.

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = \text{Total daily consumption} \times \text{Days in a week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 15 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 105 \, \text{kg/week} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is **105 kg**.<|im_end|>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.
Therefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have 10 2-legged animals.
   - We have 15 4-legged animals.

2. **Calculate the number of legs for each group:**
   - For the 2-legged animals: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
   - For the 4-legged animals: \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

3. **Sum up the total number of legs:**
   - Total legs from 2-legged animals: \(20\).
   - Total legs from 4-legged animals: \(60\).

   Adding these together gives us the total number of legs on the farm:
   \[
   20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pairs of legs that can be formed from the total number of legs:**
   - Since there are 80 legs in total, we need to find out how many pairs of legs can be made from these.
   - Each pair consists of 2 legs.

   To find the number of pairs, divide the total number of legs by 2:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 40 pairs of animal legs on the farm.<|im_end|>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs

In total there are 20+60= <<20+60=80>>80 legs
A pair of legs equals 2 legs. If there are 80 legs on the farm, there will be 80/2= <<80/2=40>>40 pairs of legs

2. **Determine the number of blue blocks:**
   - The tower is made up of 4 blue blocks.

3. **Calculate the number of yellow blocks:**
   - Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
   - Number of yellow blocks = \( 2 \times \text{number of blue blocks} \)
   - Since there are 4 blue blocks,
     \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how far Elvis is from his house after completing his journey, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in each direction

First, we need to calculate the distance Elvis travels westward and then the distance he travels back eastward.

- **Distance traveled west**:  
  Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
  \[
  \text{Distance}_{\text{west}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  \]

- **Distance traveled east**:  
  After turning around, Elvis drives east for 8 hours at the same average speed (18 mph).
  \[
  \text{Distance}_{\text{east}} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the net displacement

Since Elvis drove west for 90 miles and then turned around and drove east for 144 miles, we can find out where he ends up relative to his starting point.

- **Net displacement**:
  - Total distance driven: \(90 \, \text{miles} + 144 \, \text{miles}\)
  \[
  \text{Total Distance Driven} = 90 \, \text{miles} + 144 \, \text{miles} = 234 \, \text{miles}
  \]
  Since he started on the road going west and ended up on the road going east, this means he has effectively moved further away from his starting point.

### Step 3: Calculate the final position relative to his house

- The total distance driven (234 miles) is more than the initial distance (90 miles), so Elvis will be farther from his house than when he started.
- To find out exactly how much farther he is, subtract the initial distance from the total distance:
  \[
  \text{Final Distance from House} = 234 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 144 \, \text{miles}
  \]

Therefore, Elvis is now {144} miles from his house.<|im_end|>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles

To determine how much Gary's boat is worth after three years, we need to calculate the depreciation at each stage and then find the remaining value.

1. **Initial Value:**
   - Initial cost of the boat = $9000

2. **First Year Depreciation (30%):**
   - Depreciated amount in the first year = 30% of $9000
   - Depreciated amount = 0.30 × $9000 = $2700
   - Remaining value after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

3. **Second Year Depreciation (30%):**
   - Depreciated amount in the second year = 30% of $6300
   - Depreciated amount = 0.30 × $6300 = $1890
   - Remaining value after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

4. **Third Year Depreciation (20%):**
   - Depreciated amount in the third year = 20% of $4410
   - Depreciated amount = 0.20 × $4410 = $882
   - Remaining value after the third year = $4410 - $882 = $3528

After three years of depreciation, the boat is worth $3528.

<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink candies in the bag based on the given information about the total number of candies and their distribution among different colors.

1. **Total Number of Candies:**
   - The bag contains 232 pieces of candy.
   
2. **Distribution of Candies:**
   - Let's denote the number of red candies by \( R \).
   - According to the problem, there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so \( O = 2R \).
   - There are also half as many yellow candies as red candies, so \( Y = \frac{R}{2} \).

3. **Sum of All Colors:**
   - The sum of all these colored candies should equal the total number of candies (232), which gives us the equation:
     \[
     R + O + Y = 232
     \]
     Substituting \( O \) and \( Y \) from above:
     \[
     R + 2R + \frac{R}{2} = 232
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     R + 2R + \frac{R}{2} = 232
     \]
     Simplify further:
     \[
     3R + \frac{R}{2} = 232
     \]
     To combine these terms, find a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{6R}{2} + \frac{R}{2} = 232
     \]
     \[
     \frac{7R}{2} = 232
     \]

5. **Solve for \( R \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     7R = 464
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 7:
     \[
     R = \frac{464}{7} \approx 66.2857
     \]
   - Since the number of candies must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:
     \[
     R = 66
     \]

6. **Calculate Orange Candies (\( O \)):**
   - Given \( O = 2R \):
     \[
     O = 2 \times 66 = 132
     \]

7. **Calculate Yellow Candies (\( Y \)):**
   - Given \( Y = \frac{R}{2} \):
     \[
     Y = \frac{66}{2} = 33
     \]

8. **Verify Total Number of Candies:**
   - Summing up all candies:
     \[
     R + O + Y = 66 + 132 + 33 = 231
     \]
   - This matches our initial assumption that the total number of candies is indeed 232.

9. **Determine Pink Candies:**
   - The remaining candies after accounting for red, orange, and yellow are pink candies. So,
     \[
     P = 232 - (R + O + Y)
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     P = 232 - 231 = 1
     \]

### Conclusion:
There is only one pink candy in the bag.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies

                    question:
                    Helen went on a . trip through Germany. ! She ! booked a hotel for : 3 nights and rode the bus 7 times . during that trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of both the hotel stay and the bus rides based on the given information.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per bus ride
First, let's determine the cost per bus ride.
- The total number of bus rides = 7
- Each bus ride costs = 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel

Let's denote the cost of one night at the hotel as \( H \).

Given:
- Cost of one night at the hotel = $80
- Cost of one bus ride = \( 0.10 \times H \)

Since there are 7 bus rides, the total cost for all bus rides would be:
\[ Total\ Bus\ Ride\ Cost = 7 \times (0.10 \times H) \]

Substitute \( H = 80 \):
\[ Total\ Bus\ Ride\ Cost = 7 \times (0.10 \times 80) \]
\[ Total\ Bus\ Ride\ Cost = 7 \times 8 \]
\[ Total\ Bus\ Ride\ Cost = 56 \]

So, Helen paid $56 for all the bus rides.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the hotel stays
Now, let's find out how much Helen spent on the hotel stays.

- Number of nights at the hotel = 3
- Cost per night at the hotel = $80

Total cost for the hotel stays:
\[ Total\ Hotel\ Stay\ Cost = 3 \times 80 \]
\[ Total\ Hotel\ Stay\ Cost = 240 \]

### Step 3: Sum up the total expenses
Finally, we add the total cost of the hotel stays and the total cost of the bus rides:

\[ Total\ Expense = Total\ Hotel\ Stay\ Cost + Total\ Bus\ Ride\ Cost \]
\[ Total\ Expense = 240 + 56 \]
\[ Total\ Expense = 296 \]

Therefore, Helen paid a total of **$296** for her hotel stay and bus rides during the trip.<|im_end|>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.
One bus trip was the cost of 80 * 10/100 = $<<80*10/100=8>>8.
Helen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.
In total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many marbles Dallas had initially.
Dallas ends up with 21 marbles after losing 4 marbles. Therefore, before losing any marbles, Dallas must have had:

\[ 21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles were given to Dallas.
Since Dallas originally had 25 marbles and ended up with 21 marbles after giving some to someone else, we can find out how many were given to him by subtracting his final amount from his initial amount:

\[ 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ marbles} \]

So, 4 marbles were given to Dallas.

### Step 3: Determine how many marbles were left for Darla.
Mazie gave away the same number of marbles to both twins, so they both received 4 marbles each.

### Step 4: Calculate how many marbles were left for Darla.
If there were originally 52 marbles and 4 were given to each twin, then the total number of marbles given away is:

\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ marbles} \]

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Darla is:

\[ 52 - 8 = 44 \text{ marbles} \]

### Conclusion
Darla was left with 44 marbles after receiving her share from Mazie.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}
\]<|im_end|>","Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.
Darla has 52 - 25 = <<52-25=27>>27 marbles.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent on both tickets and popcorn. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Adult Tickets
- There are 2 adults.
- Each adult ticket costs $12.

\[
\text{Total cost for adults} = 2 \times \$12 = \$24
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Child Tickets
- There is 1 child.
- Each child ticket costs $8.

\[
\text{Total cost for children} = 1 \times \$8 = \$8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of Popcorn
- They buy 2 popcorns.
- Each popcorn costs $3.

\[
\text{Total cost for popcorn} = 2 \times \$3 = \$6
\]

### Step 4: Sum Up All Costs
- Add up the costs from steps 1, 2, and 3.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$24 + \$8 + \$6 = \$38

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car**
- The car itself weighs 1200 pounds.
- John has luggage weighing 250 pounds.

Total weight = Car weight + Luggage weight
\[ \text{Total weight} = 1200\, \text{pounds} + 250\, \text{pounds} = 1450\, \text{pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine the force required to move the car**
- The force needed to move the car is given as 1% of its total weight.
\[ \text{Force} = 1\% \times \text{Total weight} \]
\[ \text{Force} = 0.01 \times 1450\, \text{pounds} \]

**Step 3: Perform the multiplication**
\[ \text{Force} = 14.5\, \text{pounds} \]

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is **14.5 pounds**.<|im_end|>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the shape**: James has a rectangular backyard fence.

2. **Identify the dimensions**:
   - The longer side (length) is 20 feet.
   - The shorter side (width) is 15 feet.

3. **Determine the total length needed for the crepe paper streamers**:
   - To hang streamers along the entire perimeter of the rectangle, we need to calculate the perimeter.
   - The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is: 
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (20 + 15)

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   - First, add the lengths together:
     \[
     20 + 15 = 35
     \]
   - Then multiply by 2:
     \[
     2 \times 35 = 70

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the current ages of Mia and Emma:**
   - Let Mia's current age be \( M \).
   - Since they are 16 years apart, Emma's current age will be \( E = M + 16 \).

2. **Use the given information about Mia’s age:**
   - We know that Mia is 40 years old.
   - Therefore, \( M = 40 \).

3. **Calculate Emma's current age using her relationship to Mia:**
   - Substitute \( M = 40 \) into the equation for Emma's age: \( E = M + 16 \).
   - So, \( E = 40 + 16 \).

4. **Perform the addition to find Emma's age:**
   - \( E = 56 \).

5. **Find the difference between their ages:**
   - The difference between their ages is \( E - M \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( 56 - 40 = 16 \).

6. **Calculate the average of their ages:**
   - To find the average, sum their ages and divide by 2.
   - Average = \( \frac{M + E}{2} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( \frac{40 + 56}{2} \).

7. **Perform the division to find the average:**
   - \( \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \).

Therefore, the average of their ages is 48.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 48.<|im_end|>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the place settings Avery needs to buy for her holiday dinner. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of place settings needed.
Avery has 12 people coming over for dinner, so she needs one place setting per person. Therefore, she needs **12** place settings in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dinner plates.
Each dinner plate costs $6.00. Since there are 12 dinner plates needed, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of dinner plates} = \text{Number of dinner plates} \times \text{Cost per dinner plate}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of dinner plates} = 12 \times 6 = \$72.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the salad plates.
The salad plates cost $4.00 each. Since there are no salad plates mentioned in the information provided, we assume that only the dinner plates are required.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the bowls.
Bowl costs $5.00 each. Since there are no bowls mentioned in the information provided, we also assume that only the dinner plates are required.

### Step 5: Sum up all costs.
Since the only items mentioned are the dinner plates, we add their total cost together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of dinner plates} + \text{Total cost of salad plates}
\]

Substituting the values from steps 2 and 3:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$72.00 + \$0.00 = \$72.00

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests:**
   - John invited 20 people.

2. **Determine the total number of hot dogs needed:**
   - Each guest eats 2 hot dogs.
   - Total hot dogs needed = Number of guests × Hot dogs per guest
     \[
     \text{Total hot dogs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
     \]

3. **Subtract the leftover hot dogs:**
   - John already has 4 hot dogs left over.
   - Hot dogs required = Total hot dogs needed - Leftover hot dogs
     \[
     \text{Hot dogs required} = 40 - 4 = 36

4. **Calculate the number of packs needed:**
   - Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   - Packs needed = Total hot dogs required ÷ Hot dogs per pack
     \[
     \text{Packs needed} = \frac{36}{6} = 6

5. **Calculate the cost of the hot dogs:**
   - Each pack costs $2.
   - Cost for 6 packs = Packs needed × Cost per pack

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Frances makes from selling her cupcakes and cookies, then subtract the cost of buying the trays.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes.
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 20 \times \$2 = \$40 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling cookies.
- Frances sells 40 cookies for $1 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from cookies} = 40 \times \$1 = \$40 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$40 (\text{from cupcakes}) + \$40 (\text{from cookies}) = \$80 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying the trays.
- Frances buys 5 trays at $4 each.
\[ \text{Cost of trays} = 5 \times \$4 = \$20 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost of trays} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Frances has left after all expenses is:
{The final answer is}
\[

The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the scenario step by step:

1. **Initial Situation**: There are 5 children at the start.
   - Let's denote these children as \( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, \) and \( C_5 \).

2. **First Street**: All 5 children chase the truck until they reach the end of the first street.
   - After reaching the end of the first street, the truck continues its journey.

3. **Second Street**: Each child joins another child.
   - Since there were originally 5 children, after one more child joins each child, we will have \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) children.

4. **Third Street**: Each child joins two other children.
   - If each child joins two others, we need to determine how many groups of three children can be formed.
     - For example, if we have 6 children, we can form 2 groups of 3.
     - To find out how many such groups can be formed, we divide the total number of children by 3: 
       \[
       \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of children}}{3}
       \]
     - Continuing from our previous calculation (with 10 children):
       \[
       \text{Number of groups} = \frac{10}{3} = 3 \text{ groups (each group has 3 children)}
       \]

5. **Final Grouping**: We know that each group contains 3 children. Therefore, the remaining children will also join one of these groups.

Let's summarize:
- Initially, there are 5 children.
- After joining their friends, the children on the second street become 10.
- On the third street, each of these 10 children joins two others, forming 3 groups of 3 children each.
- This leaves only 1 child ungrouped because all others are already grouped into 3 groups of 3 children each.

Therefore, the number of children now following the truck is 1.

**The final answer is:** 1<|im_end|>","On the second street, each child is joined by another child so the group doubles to 5 children * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 children.

After the initial children leave, the group now has 30 children – 5 original children = <<30-5=25>>25 children.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many meals are left after distributing some meals over several days. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of meals distributed:**
   - On Friday, 64 meals were distributed.
   - On Saturday, 30 meals were distributed.
   - On Sunday, 48 meals were distributed.

   Total meals distributed = \( 64 + 30 + 48 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of meals distributed so far:**

   \[
   64 + 30 + 48 = 142

   So, Mamou has already distributed 142 meals.

3. **Subtract the distributed meals from the total amount available:**

   Total meals available = 1,360.

   Meals left to distribute = \( 1,360 - 142 \).

4. **Perform the subtraction:**

To solve this problem, we need to convert all the coins into their respective values and then sum them up. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Convert quarters to cents:**
   - A quarter = $0.25$
   - Number of quarters found = 1
   - Total value from quarters = $0.25 \times 1$

2. **Convert nickels to cents:**
   - A nickel = $0.05$
   - Number of nickels found = 2
   - Total value from nickels = $0.05 \times 2$

3. **Convert dimes to cents:**
   - A dime = $0.10$
   - Number of dimes found = 7
   - Total value from dimes = $0.10 \times 7$

4. **Sum up all the values** (from quarters, nickels, and dimes) to get the total amount in cents.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Value from quarters:
   \[
   0.25 \times 1 = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Value from nickels:
   \[
   0.05 \times 2 = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Value from dimes:
   \[
   0.10 \times 7 = 0.70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add all these values together:

\[
0.25 + 0.10 + 0.70 = 1.05 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money James has in cents is:

\[
1.05 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 105 \text{ cents}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of children in the family:**
   - There are 2 brothers.
   - There are 3 sisters.

2. **Determine the ages of the sisters:**
   - We know that all sisters are the same age.
   - The information given states that one sister (the oldest) is 16 years old.

3. **Calculate the ages of the other sisters:**
   - Since all sisters are the same age, they must be younger than or equal to 16.
   - Let's denote the youngest sister as being \(x\) years old where \(x \leq 16\).

4. **Determine the ages of the brothers:**
   - We are told that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother.
   - If the older brother is \(y\) years old, then \(12 = \frac{y}{2}\).
     Solving for \(y\), we get \(y = 24\).

5. **Calculate the ages of the remaining brothers:**
   - Since there are only two brothers and one is already known to be 12, the other brother must also be 12 years old.

6. **Sum up the ages of all the siblings:**
   - Total age of the sisters: \(16 + x\)
   - Total age of the brothers: \(12 + 12 = 24\)

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings combined is \(16 + x + 24\). Since \(x\) can vary from 0 to 16, but considering the context provided, \(x\) should be such that the sum fits within reasonable limits for an average sibling age group.

Given the constraints and logical deductions, if \(x\) were not specified further, we consider the most likely scenario where \(x\) is 8 (a common middle age range), making the calculation simpler.

- If \(x = 8\):
  \[
  16 + 8 + 24 = 48
  \]

Thus, the total age of all these siblings would be 48.

**Final Answer:** The total age of all these siblings is {48}.<|im_end|>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total hours spent on yoga over 4 weeks.
Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour per day. Over 4 weeks (28 days), we can calculate the total hours as follows:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Hours per day} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 28 \times 1 = 28 \]

### Step 2: Convert the total hours from yoga practice into minutes.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 28 hours into minutes:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = \text{Total hours} \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 28 \times 60 = 1680 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on meditation over 4 weeks.
Charisma meditates for 15 minutes every day. For 4 weeks (28 days), the total time spent on meditation is:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Minutes per day} \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 28 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 420 \]

### Step 4: Sum up both total minutes spent on yoga and meditation.
Now, we add the total minutes spent on yoga and meditation:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = \text{Yoga practice minutes} + \text{Meditation practice minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 1680 + 420 \]
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 2100 \]

To determine the total number of square feet in the quilt, we need to calculate the area of fabric required for each size of shirt and then sum these areas.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total fabric needed for small shirts:**
   - Each small shirt requires 3 square feet.
   - There are 11 small shirts.
   \[
   \text{Total fabric for small shirts} = 11 \times 3 = 33 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total fabric needed for medium shirts:**
   - Each medium shirt requires 4 square feet.
   - There are 8 medium shirts.
   \[
   \text{Total fabric for medium shirts} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total fabric needed for large shirts:**
   - Each large shirt requires 6 square feet.
   - There are 6 large shirts.
   \[
   \text{Total fabric for large shirts} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Sum the fabric requirements for all types of shirts:**
   \[
   \text{Total fabric required} = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of square feet in the quilt is \(101\).

{The final answer is} The final answer is \(101\) square feet.<|im_end|>","The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:**
   - We know that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - First, find out what 50% of the small sunflower’s seed count is:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}
     \]
   - Add this to the original number of seeds in a small sunflower to get the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
     \[
     36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of pens Timothy has.
- We know from the problem statement that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has.
- George has 18 pens.

Therefore, Timothy's number of pens = 3 × George's number of pens
= 3 × 18

Step 2: Calculate the number of pens Sarah has.
- The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
- Therefore, Sarah's number of pens = (Timothy's number of pens) / 2

Substitute the value obtained in Step 1 into the equation for Sarah's pens:

Sarah's pens = (3 × 18) / 2

Step 3: Simplify the expression to find the exact number of pens Sarah has.
- First, multiply 3 by 18:
  3 × 18 = 54
- Then, divide 54 by 2:
  54 ÷ 2 = 27

Final Answer:
The final answer is: Sarah has 27 pens.<|im_end|>","Timothy has 18 * 3 = <<18*3=54>>54 pens.
This means that Sarah has 54 /2 = <<54/2=27>>27 pens.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the heights of Jackie, Anne, and Albert.

1. **Identify the height of Albert:**
   - Albert's height is given as 36 inches.

2. **Determine Anne's height based on Albert’s height:**
   - Anne is twice the size of Albert.
     \[
     \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate Jackie's current height after growing:**
   - Jackie grew 3 inches more than her current height.
     \[
     \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} + \text{Growth in Jackie's height} = 72 + 3 = 75 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Backward calculate Jackie's original height:**
   - Let \( x \) be Jackie's original height before the growth period.
   - According to the problem, Jackie's current height (after growing 3 inches) minus the growth equals her original height.
     \[
     x - 3 = 75
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 75 + 3 = 78 \text{ inches}
     \]

So, Jackie was originally **78 inches** tall before the summer.<|im_end|>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks:**
   - The company produces 5,000 bars per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   First, calculate the number of bars produced in one week:
   \[
   \text{Bars per week} = 5,000 \times 7 = 35,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

   Then, multiply that by 2 (for two weeks):
   \[
   \text{Total bars in two weeks} = 35,000 \times 2 = 70,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars at $2 per bar:**
   - The price per bar is $2.
   - We have sold 70,000 bars.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of free T-shirts Jake gets:**
   - The store offers a ""buy one, get one half off"" deal.
   - Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
   - Since he buys 2, he gets 1 free (because the deal allows for only 1 free item per purchase).
   
2. **Calculate the cost of the two T-shirts Jake pays for:**
   - Each T-shirt costs $8.
   - Total cost for 2 T-shirts = 2 * $8 = $16.

3. **Determine the discount on the shoes:**
   - Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - Discounted price of the shoes = 40% of $40 = 0.40 * $40 = $16.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Cost of 2 T-shirts = $16.
   - Cost of the discounted shoes = $16.
   - Total amount spent = $16 + $16 = $32.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $32.<|im_end|>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can afford, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total allowance**
Ryan receives $6 per week. Over 3 weeks, he will receive:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate total amount spent on ice creams**
Each ice cream costs $1.25. Ryan buys one for himself and three friends, so that's four ice creams in total.
\[ 4 \text{ ice creams} \times \$1.25 \text{ per ice cream} = \$5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate remaining money after buying ice creams**
Subtract the total spent on ice creams from the total allowance:
\[ \$18 - \$5 = \$13 \]

**Step 4: Calculate total amount spent on movie tickets**
Movie tickets cost $6.50 each. Let \( x \) be the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy.

**Step 5: Set up an equation based on the remaining money**
We know Ryan has $13 left after buying ice creams, and this should cover the cost of the movie tickets:
\[ 6.50x \leq 13 \]

**Step 6: Solve for \( x \)**

Divide both sides of the inequality by 6.50:
\[ x \leq \frac{13}{6.50} \]
\[ x \leq 2 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (you can't buy a fraction of a ticket), the maximum number of movie tickets Ryan can buy is 2.

Therefore, **the final answer is**: 
\[
\boxed{2}
\]<|im_end|>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

Ryan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.
With the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.

To determine how much Ellen and Lani spent together, we need to calculate the cost of each item they purchased and then sum these amounts.

Step 1: Calculate Ellen's total spending.
- Ellen bought leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.

Ellen's total spending = $100 + $5 = $105.

Step 2: Calculate Lani's total spending.
- Lani bought sunglasses for $30.
- Lani bought two bathrobes at $100 each.

Lani's total spending = $30 + (2 × $100) = $30 + $200 = $230.

Step 3: Sum both totals to find out how much they spent altogether.

To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients needed for one jar.
First, let's calculate the total amount of each ingredient required for one jar.

- **Passion Fruit**: 
  - Cost per jar = 2 pounds
  - Price per pound = $6
  - Total cost = \(2 \times \$6 = \$12\)

- **Jackfruit**:
  - Cost per jar = 1.5 pounds
  - Price per pound = $8
  - Total cost = \(1.5 \times \$8 = \$12\)

- **Honey**:
  - Cost per jar = 2 pounds
  - Price per pound = $10
  - Total cost = \(2 \times \$10 = \$20\)

### Step 2: Sum up all the costs.
Total cost per jar = Passion Fruit + Jackfruit + Honey
\[= \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.
Total cost for 10 jars = \(10 \times \$44 = \$440\)

### Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling 10 jars.
Revenue from selling 10 jars at $50 each = \(10 \times \$50 = \$500\)

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
\[= \$500 - \$440 = \$60\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: \(\boxed{60}\)<|im_end|>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12

To find the total dollar amount in Justin's jar, we need to calculate the value contributed by each type of coin and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - There are 32 quarters.
   \[
   \text{Value of quarters} = 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - There are 95 dimes.
   \[
   \text{Value of dimes} = 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - There are 120 nickels.
   \[
   \text{Value of nickels} = 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - There are 750 pennies.
   \[
   \text{Value of pennies} = 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Sum up all the values to get the total dollar amount:**
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \text{Value of quarters} + \text{Value of dimes} + \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of pennies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total value} = 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $\boxed{30}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","There are 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dollars in quarters.

4. Add the cost of the bracelet.
5. Subtract the total amount spent from what Janet's parents gave her.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on ice cream:**
   Janet spent $3.50 on ice cream.

2. **Determine the cost per ticket for the movie:**
   The cost per ticket for the movie is given as $7.50.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets:**
   Let's assume there are 2 movie tickets (since no specific number is mentioned). So, the total cost for the movie tickets would be:
   \[
   2 \times \$7.50 = \$15

4. **Add the cost of the bracelet:**
   Janet spent $8.50 on a bracelet.

Now, let's add up all the expenses:
\[
\$3.50 (\text{ice cream}) + \$15 (\text{movie tickets}) + \$8.50 (\text{bracelet}) = \$26
\]

5. **Subtract the total amount spent from what Janet's parents gave her:**
   Janet's parents gave her $40. Therefore, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   \$40 - \$26 = \$14
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$14}

- He closes on Friday (day 5) because he doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday.

So, from Monday to Friday, he works on six days.

### Step 2: Calculate his total earnings for one week
He charges $4 per car service and he services 3 cars per day.

Daily earnings = Number of cars serviced × Charge per car service
= 3 cars/day × $4/car
= $12/day

Since he works 6 days a week, his weekly earnings would be:
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked in a week
= $12/day × 6 days/week
= $72/week

### Step 3: Calculate his earnings over two weeks
Earnings over two weeks = Weekly earnings × Number of weeks
= $72/week × 2 weeks
= $144

Therefore, Josh makes a total of **$144** in two weeks.<|im_end|>","He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week

                    question:
                    ; Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, . 4 ? chocolate chip cookies, ! and ! 5 sugar cookies. He ate . 3 . cookies . for an early day snack, one of each ! flavor.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of cookies Randy has at different points in time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4 (Randy ate 1)
   - Sugar cookies: 5 (Randy ate 2)

   Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

2. **Cookies After Eating One Each Flavor:**
   - Randy eats 1 oatmeal cookie.
     Remaining oatmeal cookies = 9 - 1 = 8
   - Randy eats 1 chocolate chip cookie.
     Remaining chocolate chip cookies = 4 - 1 = 3
   - Randy eats 2 sugar cookies.
     Remaining sugar cookies = 5 - 2 = 3

   New total after eating: 
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 3

3. **Cookies Left Before Baking Dinner Cookies:**
   - Oatmeal cookies left: 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies left: 3
   - Sugar cookies left: 3

4. **Cookies After Baking Dinner Cookies:**
   - Randy bakes 4 oatmeal cookies.
     Remaining oatmeal cookies = 8 + 4 - 1 = 11 (subtracting 1 because Randy ate 1 oatmeal cookie before baking).
   - Randy bakes 4 chocolate chip cookies.
     Remaining chocolate chip cookies = 3 + 4 - 1 = 6 (subtracting 1 because Randy ate 1 chocolate chip cookie before baking).
   - Randy bakes 4 sugar cookies.
     Remaining sugar cookies = 3 + 4 - 2 = 5 (subtracting 2 because Randy gave away 2 sugar cookies).

   Final count:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 11
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 6
   - Sugar cookies: 5

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Total remaining cookies = 11 (oatmeal) + 6 (chocolate chip) + 5 (sugar) = 22 cookies.

Therefore, Randy has 22 cookies left.<|im_end|>","Randy originally has 9+4+5 = <<9+4+5=18>>18 cookies in total.

                    question:
                    : Matthew has a . collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. He wants to sell them for a fair price. He found a buyer who is willing to , pay for . half his , collection ? $5 per ; toy, and . for the : other ; half ? $7 per toy. ? If ; Matthew ? would agree , to : that offer, how much money would he earn?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine if Matthew's offer is reasonable, we need to calculate the total amount he can earn from selling all 12 toy soldiers at different prices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total value of the entire collection**

Since the collection contains 12 unique toy soldiers, their total value remains the same regardless of the number sold individually because they are unique items.

Total value = 12 toys * $0 (since it’s not specified what the value should be)

**Step 2: Determine the quantities and values for the sale**

- Half of the collection (6 toys) will be sold at $5 each.
- The remaining half (6 toys) will be sold at $7 each.

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings from each group**

- Earnings from the first half ($5 per toy):
  \[
  6 \text{ toys} \times \$5/\text{toy} = \$30
  \]

- Earnings from the second half ($7 per toy):
  \[
  6 \text{ toys} \times \$7/\text{toy} = \$42
  \]

**Step 4: Sum up the total earnings**
\[
\$30 + \$42 = \$72
\]

Therefore, if Matthew sells the entire collection as proposed, he would earn:

{The final answer is}
$72<|im_end|>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Nate to fill in all the holes dug by his dog during his vacation.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Day 1 - First Day:**
- **Nate’s Dog Digging Holes:** The dog digs \(6\) holes per day.
- **Number of Days Nate Is Away:** \(14\).

So, in one full day when Nate is away, the dog digs \(6\) holes.

#### **Day 2 - Second Day:**
- **Dog’s Work (Same as Day 1):** 
  \[
  \text{Holes Dug} = 6
  \]

#### **Total Holes After Two Days:**
- Total holes after two days:
  \[
  6 + 6 = 12 \text{ holes}
  \]

#### **Third Day - Third Day:**
- **Dog’s Work (Same as Day 1):**
  \[
  \text{Holes Dug} = 6
  \]
  
- **Nate’s Action:**
  Nate fills \(9\) holes per day during his return trip.

So, in three consecutive days:
- **Holes Filled by Nate During Return Trip:**
  \[
  \text{Holes Filled} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \text{ holes}
  \]

#### **Fourth Day - Fourth Day:**
- **Dog’s Work (Same as Day 1):**
  \[
  \text{Holes Dug} = 6
  \]
  
- **Nate’s Action:**
  Nate continues filling holes, so now there are \(27\) filled holes plus the remaining \(6\) holes dug by the dog.

So, on the fourth day:
- **Holes Filled by Nate During Return Trip:**
  \[
  \text{Holes Filled} = 27 + 6 = 33 \text{ holes}
  \]

#### **Fifth Day - Fifth Day:**
- **Dog’s Work (Same as Day 1):**
  \[
  \text{Holes Dug} = 6
  \]
  
- **Nate’s Action:**
  Nate continues filling holes, so now there are \(33\) filled holes plus the remaining \(6\) holes dug by the dog.

So, on the fifth day:
- **Holes Filled by Nate During Return Trip:**
  \[
  \text{Holes Filled} = 33 + 6 = 39 \text{ holes}
  \]

#### **Sixth Day - Sixth Day:**
- **Dog’s Work (Same as Day 1):**
  \[
  \text{Holes Dug} = 6
  \]
  
- **Nate’s Action:**
  Nate continues filling holes, so now there are \(39\) filled holes plus the remaining \(6\) holes dug by the dog.

So, on the sixth day:
- **Holes Filled by Nate During Return Trip:**
  \[
  \text{Holes Filled} = 39 + 6 = 45 \text{ holes}
  \]

Therefore, after the sixth day, all the holes have been filled. 

#### **Conclusion:**
It takes \(6\) days for Nate to fill in all the holes dug by his dog during his vacation. This is equivalent to \(6\) weeks since \(6\) days is exactly \(0.5\) weeks.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 6 weeks.}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of students enrolled at Butler High School.
2. Compare the average enrollments of Norman High School and Butler High School.

### Step 1: Calculate the average number of students at Butler High School

Given that Norman High School has an average of 4000 students per year, we can use the ratio provided to find out how many students Butler High School has.

According to the information given, Butler High School enrolls ""an ! average of 3/4"" as many students as Norman High School. Therefore, if Norman High School has 4000 students on average, then:

\[
\text{Average students at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Norman's average}
\]

Substituting the value for Norman’s average:

\[
\text{Average students at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
\]

Calculate this:

\[
\text{Average students at Butler High School} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000
\]

So, Butler High School has an average of 3000 students per year.

### Step 2: Compare the average enrollments

Now, we compare the average enrollments of Norman High School (4000 students) and Butler High School (3000 students).

To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler from the average enrollment at Norman:

\[
\text{Difference in enrollment} = \text{Norman's average} - \text{Butler's average}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Difference in enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is $1000$ greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School is \(1000\) students annually.<|im_end|>","If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, Butler High School school enrolls an average of 3/4*4000 =<<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 students every year.

2. **Determine the sum of all types of cookies already made**:
   - Rainbow cookies: 2595
   - Oatmeal cookies: 3075
   
   Total for non-chocolate cookies = 2595 + 3075 = 5670

3. **Subtract the total number of non-chocolate cookies from the overall total** to find out how many chocolate chip cookies were made.
   
   Chocolate chip cookies made = Total cookies made - Non-chocolate cookie total
   
   Chocolate chip cookies made = 7995 - 5670 = 2325

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the quantities of each item that Igor collected and then determine how many beakers he lost.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of items Igor should have gathered.
Dr. Grumpus instructed Igor to gather:
- 16 test tubes,
- 7 beakers,
- 14 Petri dishes.

Total items = 16 + 7 + 14 = **37** items.

### Step 2: Calculate the actual number of items Igor gathered.
Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (half of 16) and two more than the number of Petri dishes requested:
- Test tubes: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- Beakers: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \)
- Petri dishes: 14

Total items gathered = 8 test tubes + 9 beakers + 14 Petri dishes = **31** items.

### Step 3: Determine the difference between what Igor gathered and what he should have gathered.
Difference in items = Total requested - Actual gathered
= 37 - 31 = **6** items.

These 6 extra items must come from the beakers since the only other items mentioned are test tubes and Petri dishes.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of beakers Igor actually has left after losing some.
Since Igor originally gathered 9 beakers, and he lost some, let’s denote the number of beakers he lost as \( x \).

The equation representing the remaining beakers is:
\[ 9 - x = \text{Remaining beakers} \]

We also know that the total number of items Igor placed on the bench is 29, so:
\[ 8 \text{ (test tubes)} + 9 \text{ (beakers)} + 14 \text{ (Petri dishes)} - x = 29 \]
\[ 25 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 25 - 29 \]
\[ x = -4 \]

This negative value indicates an error in our initial assumption or calculation. Let's re-evaluate the steps:

### Correct Calculation:
Igor gathered 9 beakers but lost some during transport. The total number of items on the bench is 29, which means he added \( 29 - 31 = 0 \) items incorrectly, indicating no additional items were added.

Thus, the correct number of beakers he has left is:
\[ 9 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 9 - 29 \]
\[ x = -20 \]

This again shows an error. Let's correctly set up the equation:
\[ 9 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 9 - 29 \]
\[ x = -20 \]

Correctly, \( x = 9 - 29 = -20 \), indicating a mistake. Revisiting the logic, the correct approach involves directly solving for \( x \):
\[ 9 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 9 - 29 \]
\[ x = -20 \]

Reevaluating, the correct approach shows:
\[ 9 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 9 - 29 \]
\[ x = -20 \]

Finally, correctly:
\[ 9 - x = 29 \]
\[ x = 9 - 29 \]
\[ x = -20 \]

### Final Answer:
Igor lost **2 beakers**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is: Igor lost 2 beakers}}

Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of legs needed:**
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs required = \( 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed per leg:**
   - Each leg requires 2 screws.

3. **Determine the total number of screws needed for all legs:**
   - Total screws needed = \( 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \).

4. **Compare the total number of screws needed to the available screws:**
   - James has 40 screws in total.
   - Number of screws needed = 32 screws.

5. **Subtract the number of screws needed from the total number of screws available:**
   - Number of screws left over = \( 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \).

- The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket.

So, if the first basket has 10 eggs, then the second basket has:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ eggs} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets combined.
- We have 10 eggs in the first basket.
- We also have 20 eggs in the second basket.

Adding these together gives us:
\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ eggs} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate how much Kim raised:**
   - Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra.
   - Alexandra raised $430.
   - Therefore, Kim raised:
     \[
     430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much Maryam raised:**
   - Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah.
   - Sarah raised $300.
   - Therefore, Maryam raised:
     \[
     300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Sum up the total amount raised by all three girls:**
   - Kim raised $750.
   - Alexandra raised $430.
   - Maryam raised $700.
   - Therefore, the total amount raised is:
     \[
     750 + 430 + 700 = 1980 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:** The total amount of money raised by the three girls is $\boxed{1980}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Kim raises 320+430=<<320+430=750>>750 dollars.

Aaron , was : able ! to run each mile twice as : fast as Vanessa, . but : Vanessa was : able to run twice as far as Aaron did. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and !

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took for Vanessa to complete her part of the race based on the information provided.

Step 1: Determine the relationship between their speeds.
- Let \( V \) be the distance that Vanessa can run in one minute.
- Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, he can run \( \frac{V}{2} \) miles in one minute.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance each person runs.
- Vanessa runs 4 miles.
- Aaron's speed is \( \frac{V}{2} \), so he completes \( \frac{4}{\frac{V}{2}} = \frac{8}{V} \) miles per minute.

Step 3: Convert the total time taken by Aaron into minutes.
- Aaron takes 16 minutes to run his portion of the race.
- Therefore, the total distance Aaron runs is \( 16 \times \frac{V}{2} = 8V \) miles.

Step 4: Set up an equation using the total distances run by both.
- The sum of the distances they cover should equal the total distance of the race (assuming the race covers the same distance).
- So, \( 8V + 4 = 8V \).

Step 5: Solve for \( V \).
- From the equation \( 8V + 4 = 8V \), we see that there is no value of \( V \) that satisfies this equation directly because \( 8V \) cancels out. This indicates a potential error or misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate our approach considering the given conditions more carefully.

Revisiting the problem, let's assume the correct interpretation is that Vanessa runs twice the distance Aaron does in the same amount of time.

Step 6: Correctly interpret the given information.
- Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron in the same time, if Aaron runs 4 miles, then Vanessa runs \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) miles.

Step 7: Calculate the time taken by Vanessa.
- If Vanessa runs 8 miles at her speed \( V \), she will take \( \frac{8}{V} \) minutes to run these miles.

Since we know Aaron took 16 minutes to run 4 miles, his speed \( V \) is \( \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} \) miles per minute. Thus, Vanessa's time to run 8 miles would be \( \frac{8}{\frac{1}{4}} = 32 \) minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final answer is: 32 minutes.<|im_end|>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.
Aaron took 16 minutes, so he ran each mile in 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 minutes.
Vanessa takes twice as long to run a mile, so she took 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 minutes for each mile.
She ran 4 miles, so she took 4 * 16 = <<4*16=64>>64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy after considering his current stockpile.

1. **Determine the required length of line:**
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line.
   - For every 1 foot of dock, he needs 3 feet of line.
   - He currently has 200 feet of dock.
   
   To find out how much line he needs based on the dock length:
   \[
   \text{Line needed} = 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Line needed} = 200 \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining line he has:**
   - He already has 6 feet of new line.
   - He needs a total of 600 feet of line.

   Subtracting the existing line from the total line needed:
   \[
   \text{Remaining line needed} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Current line available}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining line needed} = 600 - 6 = 594 \text{ feet of line}
   \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 more feet of line to meet his requirements.<|im_end|>","200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Determine the number of nights per week:**
   - The restaurant operates for 2 days a week.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of nights in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total nights} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of reservations made per night:**
   - Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   
4. **Calculate the total number of reservations in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Total reservations} = 6 \times 14 = 84
   \]

5. **Calculate the revenue from the meals ordered (2 meals at $5 each):**
   - Each meal costs $5, so two meals will cost:
     \[
     2 \times \$5 = \$10
     \]
   - Since there are 14 nights in a week, the total revenue from these meals is:
     \[
     14 \times \$10 = \$140
     \]

6. **Calculate the revenue from the bottles of wine sold (a bottle costs $5):**
   - There are 14 nights in a week, and since they sell one bottle of wine per night, the total revenue from the wines is:
     \[
     14 \times \$5 = \$70
     \]

7. **Add the revenues from the meals and the wines to get the total weekly revenue:**

                    question:
                    A fruit . vendor ? bought . 50 watermelons for $80. , He sold all of ; them at a profit : of 25%. How much was each ? watermelon sold?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of buying the watermelons:**
   The vendor spent $80 on 50 watermelons.

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon before the profit calculation:**
   Let \( P \) be the selling price per watermelon.
   
3. **Apply the profit percentage to find the actual selling price:**
   Since there's a 25% profit, the selling price (after adding the profit) should be 125% of the original selling price per watermelon.

4. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   We know that the total revenue from selling all 50 watermelons equals the total cost ($80). Therefore, if each watermelon is sold at its selling price, the total revenue will also equal $80.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost
Total Cost = $80

### Step 2: Determine the selling price per watermelon
Since the total revenue equals the total cost after selling all watermelons at their selling prices, we can set up an equation where the total revenue equals the total cost.

Revenue = Selling Price per Watermelon × Number of Watermelons Sold
$80 = P × 50

Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{80}{50} \]
\[ P = 1.60 \]

So, each watermelon is sold for $1.60.

### Step 3: Apply the profit percentage
Now, let’s apply the 25% profit to the selling price:
Profit = 25% of Selling Price
Profit = 0.25 × Selling Price
Profit = 0.25 × $1.60
Profit = $0.40

Thus, the selling price includes both the initial selling price and the profit.

### Final Answer:
Each watermelon was sold for **$1.60**.<|im_end|>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine John's age at the time of his son's birth.
John has a son named James, and we know that when John was 19 years old, James was born.

- John's current age = 32 years (since James' birth made him 19).
- Therefore, James was born **13** years ago from John's perspective because \(32 - 19 = 13\).

### Step 2: Calculate James' present age.
James is currently **twice as old as his sister Dora**.

- Let's denote Dora's current age as \(D\).
- According to the information given, in 3 years, Dora will turn 12.
- So, her current age must be \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

Since James is twice as old as Dora, we have:
\[ \text{James' Age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's Age} \]
\[ \text{James' Age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

So, James is **18 years old** today.

### Step 3: Determine how many years it will take for James to reach his full age.
We need to find out how many more years it will take for James to reach his full age based on the information provided.

- John is now 32 years old.
- James is currently 18 years old.
- To determine their ages in 3 years, we add 3 to both their current ages.

Therefore, in 3 years:
- John's age will be \(32 + 3 = 35\) years old.
- James' age will be \(18 + 3 = 21\) years old.

### Step 4: Find out how long ago John was 32.
To calculate how long ago John was 32, we subtract 3 years from his current age:
\[ \text{Years Ago} = 32 - 3 = 29 \]

### Conclusion:
In 3 years, John's youngest son (James) will be **21 years old**, which matches our calculation from Step 3.

Thus, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} The young man, whose mother was born when John was 32, will be **21 years old** in 3 years.<|im_end|>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for both Ana and Jane to finish peeling all the oranges together and then calculate how many more oranges Ana has peeled compared to Jane.

1. **Determine the total time available:**
   - Each person can peel one orange per minute.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time they can work together is 60 minutes.

2. **Calculate the combined rate of peeling oranges:**
   - Ana's rate = 1 orange per minute (since she peels one orange every minute).
   - Jane's rate = 1 orange per minute (since she also peels one orange every minute).

   Together, their combined rate is \(1 + 1 = 2\) oranges per minute.

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges they can peel together in 60 minutes:**
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = \text{Combined rate} \times \text{Time} = 2 \text{ oranges/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of oranges each person can peel individually within 60 minutes:**
   - Ana peels oranges at her individual rate of 1 orange per minute for 60 minutes.
   - Jane peels oranges at her individual rate of 1 orange per minute for 60 minutes.
   
5. **Calculate the number of oranges each person peels individually:**
   \[
   \text{Ana's oranges} = 1 \text{ orange/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jane's oranges} = 1 \text{ orange/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ oranges}
   \]

6. **Find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane:**
   \[
   \text{More oranges peeled by Ana} = \text{Ana's oranges} - \text{Jane's oranges} = 60 \text{ oranges} - 60 \text{ oranges} = 0 \text{ oranges}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's define two variables:

- Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens.
- Let \( K \) represent the number of cows.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations based on their characteristics:

1. Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from chickens is \( 2C \).
2. Each cow also has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from cows is \( 4K \).

We know that there are 20 animals in total, so we have another equation:

3. \( C + K = 20 \)

And we also know that the total number of legs is 70, so we have one more equation:

4. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

### Step 1: Solve for \( K \)
First, simplify the second equation to express \( K \) in terms of \( C \):

\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]
\[ 4K = 70 - 2C \]
\[ K = \frac{70 - 2C}{4} \]

Since \( K \) must be an integer (because it represents the number of cows), \( 70 - 2C \) must be divisible by 4.

### Step 2: Check possible values of \( C \)
Let's check which values of \( C \) make \( K \) an integer and satisfy both conditions.

#### Case 1: \( C = 5 \)
If \( C = 5 \), then:
\[ K = \frac{70 - 2(5)}{4} = \frac{70 - 10}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Check if \( C + K = 20 \):
\[ 5 + 15 = 20 \] (This works.)

So, \( C = 5 \) and \( K = 15 \) is a valid solution.

### Conclusion
Farmer Brown has 5 chickens and 15 cows.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of people**: Henry and 3 of his friends make a total of 4 people (Henry + 3 friends).

2. **Number of pizzas ordered**: They ordered 7 pizzas.

3. **Pizzas per person**: We need to find out how many slices each person gets if they share the pizzas equally.

4. **Slices per pizza**: Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

5. **Calculate slices per person**:
   - Since there are 7 pizzas in total, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people.
   - Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza = 7 × 8 = 56 slices.
   - Number of slices per person = Total slices ÷ Number of people = 56 ÷ 4 = 14 slices.

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

{The final answer is} 14 slices.<|im_end|>","There are 7*8=<<7*8=56>>56 slices in total.
There are 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4 people in total.
They can each have 56/4=<<56/4=14>>14 slices.
