To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day**

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

**Step 2: Determine how many eggs are eaten for breakfast**

Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.

So, after eating for breakfast, the remaining eggs are:

\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

These 13 eggs are used to bake muffins for friends.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs left over**

After baking muffins, the number of eggs left over is:

\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market.

**Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling these eggs**

Each egg is sold for $2.

So, the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs is:

\[ 9 \times 2 = \$18 \]

Therefore, Janet makes $18 in dollars every day at the farmers' market.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: $\$18$.<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bolts of fiber are required for the robe based on the given information.

Step 1: Determine the amount of blue fiber needed.
- The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Step 2: Determine the amount of white fiber needed.
- The white fiber is half as much as the blue fiber.
- Since 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, then half that amount would be \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bolts of fiber needed.
- Add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber together.
- Total bolts = Blue fibers + White fibers = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required for the robe is **3**.<|im_end|>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber

                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value . of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the house including the repair expenses**

- Josh bought the house for $80,000.
- He put in $50,000 in repairs.

Total cost = Cost of house + Repair expenses
            = $80,000 + $50,000
            = $130,000

So far, we've calculated that the total amount spent on the house is $130,000.

**Step 2: Determine the increase in value due to the renovations**

Josh's repairs caused an increase of 150% in the value of the house.

Since 150% means multiplying by 1.5,

Increase in value = Total cost × Increase percentage
                  = $130,000 × 1.5
                  = $195,000

This calculation shows that the house’s value has gone up by $195,000 because of the renovations.

**Step 3: Calculate the net profit**

Net profit = New value of the house - Original purchase price
            = ($195,000 - $80,000) - $80,000
            = $115,000 - $80,000
            = $35,000

Therefore, Josh made a profit of **$35,000** from his investment after accounting for the initial costs and the renovation expenses.<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance James runs in one session (one ""session"" being one sprint) and then multiply that by the number of sessions per week.

Step 1: Determine the distance James runs in one sprint.
James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

Step 2: Determine how many times James runs in a week.
James runs 3 sprints per week.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance James runs in one week.
Since he runs 3 sprints per week and each sprint is 60 meters long, we can calculate the total distance as follows:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of sprints per week} \times \text{Distance per sprint} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 3 \times 60 \]

Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Therefore, James runs a total of 180 meters every week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total amount of feed needed for all chickens in one feeding session.**

Given that there are 20 chickens and each gets 3 cups of feed per session, we can calculate the total amount of feed needed as follows:
\[ \text{Total feed per session} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ cups} \]

So far, we know that the feed given out during each session is exactly enough for 20 chickens.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of feed sessions in a day.**

Since the feed is divided over three different times (morning, afternoon, evening), we have:
\[ \text{Number of sessions} = 3 \]

**Step 3: Determine the total amount of feed required for all chickens in a day.**

We multiply the total feed needed per session by the number of sessions:
\[ \text{Total feed needed per day} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ cups} \]

So far, we've calculated that Wendi needs 180 cups of feed per day for all her chickens.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining feed after giving the morning and afternoon feed.**

- **Morning feed:** Given to 15 chickens.
  \[ \text{Feed given in the morning} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ cups} \]
  
- **Afternoon feed:** Given to the rest of the flock.
  \[ \text{Remaining chickens} = 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ chickens} \]
  \[ \text{Feed given in the afternoon} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining feed needed after giving morning and afternoon feed.**

Subtract the amounts already given from the total daily requirement:
\[ \text{Remaining feed needed} = 180 - 45 - 15 = 120 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs 120 more cups of feed to complete her last meal of the day.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 120}}
\]<|im_end|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 16 glasses based on their prices.

Step 1: Determine the price of one glass.
- The base price for any single glass is $5.

Step 2: Calculate the price for every second glass.
- Every second glass has a reduced price at 60% of its original price.
- Therefore, the reduced price per glass = \( 5 \times 0.6 = \$3 \).

Step 3: Calculate the total number of glasses that will have the reduced price.
- Since there are 16 glasses in total and they come in pairs (every second), half of them will be reduced.
- Number of reduced-price glasses = \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the reduced-price glasses.
- Cost for 8 reduced-price glasses = \( 8 \times 3 = \$24 \).

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the full-price glasses.
- Cost for 8 full-price glasses = \( 8 \times 5 = \$40 \).

Step 6: Add both amounts together to get the total cost.
- Total cost = Cost for full-price glasses + Cost for reduced-price glasses
- Total cost = \( 40 + 24 = \$64 \).

Final Answer: Kylar needs to pay $64 for all the glasses.<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - We know that Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Seattle has 20 sheep.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Charleston = \(4 \times 20\).

\[ \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 80 \]

2. **Determine the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - The number of sheep in Charleston was found to be 80.
   - Therefore, the number of sheep in Toulouse = \(2 \times 80\).

\[ \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 160 \]

3. **Sum the total number of sheep:**
   - Summing the sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle gives us:

\[ \text{Total Sheep} = 160 (\text{Toulouse}) + 80 (\text{Charleston}) + 20 (\text{Seattle}) \]

\[ \text{Total Sheep} = 260 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break down the entire process into steps and calculate the time taken for Carla to complete the download.

1. **Calculate the remaining distance after 40% of the download:**
   - The total size of the file is \( 200 \) GB.
   - After 40%, the remaining size to be downloaded is \( 80\% \) of \( 200 \) GB.
   - Calculation: \( 200 \times 0.8 = 160 \) GB.

2. **Calculate the initial speed before the restart:**
   - Carla's normal download speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \) GB per minute.
   - Time to download the first part (after the restart): Since the speed remains constant during this period, we use her normal speed to find out how long it takes to download the remaining \( 160 \) GB at her normal rate.
   
3. **Calculate the time taken for the restart:**
   - The restart takes \( 20 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time including the restart:**
   - Add up all the times calculated in the previous steps.

Let’s do these calculations:

1. **Remaining distance after 40%:**
\[ 160 \text{ GB} \]

2. **Time to download the first part:**
Since her normal speed is \( \frac{1}{2} \) GB/minute, the time to download the remaining \( 160 \) GB at that speed would be:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{160 \text{ GB}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ GB/minute}} = 320 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Total time including the restart:**
- Initial download time: Let’s assume it took \( T \) minutes to reach the point where Windows forced a restart.
- Restart time: \( 20 \) minutes.
- Total time = \( T + 320 \) minutes.

We know that after reaching the restart point, she needs to start again from the beginning, so we add another \( 320 \) minutes for the second download attempt.

Therefore, the total time to download the file is:
\[ T + 320 + 20 \]

Given that the total time must equal the sum of all parts, let's denote the initial download time as \( T \):
\[ T + 320 + 20 = 320 + 20 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ T + 340 = 320 \]
Thus,
\[ T = 320 - 340 \]
But since we have already factored in the restart time and the second round, we need to subtract the restart time:
\[ T = 20 \]

So, the total time to download the file is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 320 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Hence, it will take Carla **360 minutes** to download the file.<|im_end|>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB

To determine how far John is from his home after driving for 4 hours, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled.

1. **Calculate the distance driven initially:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance driven during the 2 hours of standing still traffic:**
   - John stands still for 2 hours at a speed of 0 mph.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = 0 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 0 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance driven in the remaining time (after turning around):**
   - The remaining time is \(4\) hours minus \(3\) hours (initial trip) plus \(2\) hours (standing still) equals \(3\) hours.
   - John drives at a speed of \(80\) mph for \(3\) hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_3 = 80 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance driven:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 + \text{Distance}_3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 240 \text{ miles} = 420 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, John is 420 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.<|im_end|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

**Step 1: Calculate Eliza's regular pay**

- Regular hours = 40 hours
- Regular rate = $10/hour
- Regular pay = Regular hours × Regular rate

\[ \text{Regular pay} = 40 \times 10 = \$400 \]

**Step 2: Calculate Eliza's overtime pay**

- Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours
- Overtime rate = 1.2 times the regular rate
- Overtime pay = Overtime hours × (Overtime rate)

\[ \text{Overtime hours} = 45 - 40 = 5 \]
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 1.2 \times 10 = \$12/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Overtime pay} = 5 \times 12 = \$60 \]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings**

- Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 400 + 60 = \$460 \]

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are **$460**.<|im_end|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month:**
   - The program had 60 downloads.
   
2. **Second Month:**
   - The number of downloads is three times that of the first month.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.
   
3. **Third Month:**
   - The number of downloads is 70% (since it reduces by 30%) of the downloads from the second month.
   - Calculation: \( 0.7 \times 180 = 126 \) downloads.

Now, let's add up the downloads from all three months:

- First month: 60 downloads
- Second month: 180 downloads
- Third month: 126 downloads

To find the total cost of Toula's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the donuts:**
   - Number of dozens of donuts = 3
   - Cost per dozen of donuts = $68
   - Total cost of donuts = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = \$204
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:**
   - Number of dozens of mini cupcakes = 2
   - Cost per dozen of mini cupcakes = $80
   - Total cost of mini cupcakes = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
   \[
   \text{Total cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = \$160

                    question:
                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will : cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 : lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. , It costs $3 a year to water and feed ! the tree. How many years ; will ; it take before he ? starts earning money on the lemon ! tree?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take before Carlos starts making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net gain per year and then divide the initial investment cost by this annual profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Annual Revenue:**
   - The tree grows 7 lemons per year.
   - He sells each lemon for $1.5.
   - Total revenue = \(7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5\).

2. **Calculate Annual Expenses:**
   - Watering and feeding costs $3 per year.

3. **Determine Net Gain Per Year:**
   - Net gain per year = Total revenue - Annual expenses.
   - Net gain per year = \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5.

4. **Set Up the Equation to Find the Number of Years Before Profitable:**
   Let \( n \) be the number of years before Carlos starts making a profit.
   
   The total amount earned over \( n \) years must cover the initial cost of planting the tree.
   
   Therefore, the equation is:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = n \times \text{Net gain per year}
   \]
   
   We set up the equation as follows:
   \[
   n \times (\$7.5 \times n) = \$90
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   7.5n^2 = 90
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 7.5:
   \[
   n^2 = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
   \]
   
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   n = \sqrt{12} \approx 3.46
   \]
   
   Since the number of years cannot be fractional in practical terms, round up to the next whole number (since even a small fraction of a year would result in loss):
   \[
   n = 4
   \]

### Conclusion:
It will take approximately 4 years for Carlos to start making a profit from his lemon tree.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\).<|im_end|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5

It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about how many vacuum cleaners were sold at each location. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Melanie starts with a total number of vacuum cleaners:**
   - We know that after selling some vacuum cleaners, Melanie has 5 left.
   
2. **Calculate the amount sold at the orange house:**
   - Since Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house, we can determine how much she had before selling to the orange house.
   - If \( x \) represents the number of vacuum cleaners she started with, then \( \frac{x}{2} \) is what she had before selling to the orange house.
   - After selling half of what she had at the orange house, she has 5 left.

3. **Set up an equation for the orange house sale:**
   - The amount sold at the orange house is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - Therefore, the remaining vacuum cleaners after selling to the orange house is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We have \( \frac{x}{2} = 5 \).
   - To find \( x \), multiply both sides by 2: 
     \[
     x = 5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

So, Melanie started with 10 vacuum cleaners.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 10<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

   - There are 20 students in total.
   - 20% of these students are enrolled in contemporary dance.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dance enrollment:**
   - Subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining students enroll in jazz dance.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4

   \[
   \text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = 16 - 4 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - Divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%

To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both investments based on their respective growth rates.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the future value of Jewelry:**
   - Initial amount = $5,000
   - Growth rate = 2.5% (or 0.025 as a decimal)
   - Time period = 1 month
   - Future value of Jewelry = Initial amount * (1 + Growth rate)^Time period
     \[
     \text{Future Value}_{\text{Jewelry}} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025)^1 = 5000 \times 1.025 = 5125
     \]

2. **Calculate the future value of Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Initial amount = $8,000
   - Growth rate = 1.2% (or 0.012 as a decimal)
   - Time period = 1 month
   - Future value of Electronics = Initial amount * (1 + Growth rate)^Time period
     \[
     \text{Future Value}_{\text{Electronics}} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012)^1 = 8000 \times 1.012 = 8128
     \]

3. **Compare the two future values:**
   - Future value of Jewelry = $5,125
   - Future value of Electronics = $8,128
   - The higher future value corresponds to more profit.
   - Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronics gadgets because they will have a greater future value ($8,128) compared to the jewelry ($5,125).

### Final Answer:
The final answer is that the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets to maximize his profit. The potential profit from choosing electronics is $8,128.<|im_end|>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far each train traveled over the two days.

### Day 1: Traveling Westward
- Both trains start from the same location (San Rafael) and travel westward.
- Each train travels a certain distance on the first day.
- Let's denote the distance traveled on the first day as \( d \).

### Day 2: Traveling Northward
- On the second day, both trains continue their journey but now travel northward.
- Each train covers an additional distance on the second day.
- Let's denote the distance traveled on the second day as \( d' \).

Given that each train travels a total of 130 miles over these two days, we can set up the equation:

\[ d + d' = 130 \]

We also know that each train travels 80 miles on the first day. Therefore, on the second day, each train will cover half of its initial distance since it has already traveled 80 miles.

So, let's calculate the distances for each train.

#### Distance Traveled on the First Day:
\[ d = 80 \text{ miles} \]

#### Distance Traveled on the Second Day:
Since each train travels 80 miles on the first day, it will travel half of that distance on the second day.

\[ d' = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ miles} \]

Now, let's find the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

#### Total Distance Covered by Train A:
Train A travels 80 miles on the first day and then 40 miles on the second day.

\[ \text{Total Distance A} = 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ miles} \]

#### Total Distance Covered by Train B:
Train B travels 80 miles on the first day and then another 80 miles on the second day.

\[ \text{Total Distance B} = 80 + 80 = 160 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distances covered by each train in the two days are:
- **Train A:** 120 miles
- **Train B:** 160 miles

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Train A: 120 miles, Train B: 160 miles}}

To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both her teaching job and her coaching job separately, then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate Earnings from Teaching Job:
   - Jill earns $20 per hour.
   - She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Teaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Per Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Teaching} = \$20 \times 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Teaching} = \$700
   \]

#### 2. Calculate Earnings from Coaching Job:
   - Jill earns $30 per hour.
   - She works 15 hours per week as a coach.
   
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Coaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Per Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Coaching} = \$30 \times 15
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Coaching} = \$450
   \]

#### 3. Sum Up All Earnings for Annual Salary:
   - Total earnings from teaching: $700
   - Total earnings from coaching: $450
   
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Earnings from Teaching} + \text{Earnings from Coaching}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Salary} = \$700 + \$450

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many dozen eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of eggs per omelet:**
   - Claire makes a 3:egg omelet.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten in one week:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs per omelet by the number of days in a week.
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten in 4 weeks:**
   - We then multiply the total number of eggs eaten per week by the number of weeks (which is 4).
     \[
     \text{Total eggs in 4 weeks} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen. Therefore, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens that equals.
     \[
     \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{84}{12} = 7 \text{ dozen}
     \]

Therefore, Claire eats a total of \(7\) dozen eggs in 4 weeks. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week

                    question:
                    Marissa : is ? hiking : a ? 12-mile trail. She took 1 ; hour to walk . the , first 4 miles, , then another hour to , walk the next two ? miles. .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total time available for hiking.
Marissa has taken 1 hour so far. The entire hike is 12 miles long.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time needed for the hike.
Since her goal is to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the total distance, we can calculate the total time required using the formula:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}} \]

Substituting in the given values:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, she needs a total of 3 hours for the hike.

### Step 3: Calculate the time already spent on the hike.
She has already spent 1 hour walking.

### Step 4: Determine how much more time remains for her to complete the hike.
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Already Spent} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining distance.
After covering the first 4 miles, she still needs to cover \( 12 \text{ miles} - 4 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \).

### Step 6: Calculate the remaining average speed required to achieve her desired average speed of 4 miles per hour over the remaining distance.
Using the same average speed formula as before:
\[ \text{Required Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Remaining Time}} \]
\[ \text{Required Average Speed} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 4 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at an average speed of **4 miles per hour** to maintain her target of 4 miles per hour overall.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water remains after adding both drinks and accounting for the spilled orange drink.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the initial mix:**
   - Orange drink has \( \frac{2}{3} \) water.
     - Total volume = 10 liters
     - Water content = \( 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \) liters

2. **Calculate the total volume of the mixed drink:**
   - Pineapple drink has \( \frac{3}{5} \) water.
     - Volume of pineapple drink = 15 liters
     - Water content = \( 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \) liters

3. **Add the volumes together (before spilling):**
   - Total volume before spilling = \( 10 + 15 = 25 \) liters
   - Total water content before spilling = \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 \)

4. **Calculate the total water content before spilling:**
   - Convert 9 liters to fractions to add them easily.
     - \( 9 = \frac{9 \times 3}{3} = \frac{27}{3} \)
   - Total water content = \( \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \) liters

5. **Account for the spilled orange drink:**
   - Spilled volume = 1 liter
   - Remaining orange drink volume = \( 10 - 1 = 9 \) liters
   - Water content from orange drink = \( 9 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6 \) liters

6. **Calculate the new total water content after spilling:**
   - New total water content = \( \frac{47}{3} - 6 \)

7. **Convert the new total water content back to decimal form for easier calculation:**
   - \( \frac{47}{3} - 6 = \frac{47}{3} - \frac{18}{3} = \frac{29}{3} \approx 9.67 \) liters

So, the final amount of water in the remaining mixture is approximately **9.67 liters**.<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the current ages**:
   - Samantha is currently 31.
   - Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate Raymond's current age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's current age} = \text{Samantha's current age} - 6 = 31 - 6 = 25
     \]

2. **Understand the relationship between Raymond and his son**:
   - Raymond has a son who was born when Raymond was 23.

3. **Calculate the number of years since Raymond became a father**:
   - The difference in their ages (since Raymond became a father) is:
     \[
     \text{Years since Raymond became a father} = \text{Raymond's current age} - \text{Raymond's age when he became a father}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Years since Raymond became a father} = 25 - 23 = 2
     \]

4. **Determine how long ago Raymond's son was born**:
   - Since the son was born when Raymond was 23, and it has been 2 years since then, we add these 2 years to the son's current age to find out how long ago he was born.
     \[
     \text{Years ago Raymond's son was born} = \text{Son's current age} - \text{Years since Raymond became a father}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Years ago Raymond's son was born} = 31 - 2 = 29
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: 29 years ago.<|im_end|>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many DVDs Billy sold based on the given information about his customers' purchases. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 3 Customers:**
   - Each of these customers buys 1 DVD.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 (since there are 3 customers) × 1 DVD per customer = 3 DVDs.

2. **Next 2 Customers:**
   - These customers also buy 1 DVD each.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 2 (since there are 2 customers) × 1 DVD per customer = 2 DVDs.

3. **Last 3 Customers:**
   - None of these customers buy any DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 0 (since there are 3 customers) × 1 DVD per customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, let's sum up all the DVDs sold:

- From the first 3 customers: 3 DVDs
- From the next 2 customers: 2 DVDs
- From the last 3 customers: 0 DVDs

To determine the original price of the book, let's follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- The discounted price ($19.50) represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

**Step 2: Set up an equation to find the original price**
Let \( P \) be the original price of the book.

Since 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50, we can write:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( P \)**
To isolate \( P \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

**Step 4: Perform the division**
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was **$26**.<|im_end|>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the items already known.
- **Chicken Meal**: Costs $12
- **Milk Packs**: Each pack costs $3 and there are 5 packs, so \(5 \times 3 = \$15\)
- **Apples**: Each apple costs $1.50 and there are 4 apples, so \(4 \times 1.50 = \$6\)

### Step 2: Sum up the costs of these items.
\[12 (chicken meal) + 15 (milk) + 6 (apples) = \$33\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the known items from the total amount paid.
Marie paid a total of $50, so:
\[50 - 33 = \$17\]

### Step 4: Determine the cost per box of pizza.
Each box of pizza costs $8.50.

### Step 5: Divide the remaining amount by the cost per box of pizza to find out how many boxes were purchased.
Since each box costs $8.50, the number of boxes can be calculated as follows:
\[\frac{17}{8.5} = 2\]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
The final answer is: 2 boxes of pizza.<|im_end|>","Five packs of milk cost $3 x 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 30 nights in a month (assuming an average month has about 30 days).

\[
\text{Total servings} = \text{Number of servings per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total servings} = 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings.

\[
\text{Number of cartons needed} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of cartons needed} = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.**

Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \times 4.00 = \$16.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Henry made two stops on his 60-mile bike trip. The first stop occurred after 20 miles, and the second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

### Step 2: Determine the Positions of Stops
- First stop: After 20 miles.
- Second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Since the total distance is 60 miles, we can determine where the second stop is located:

\[ \text{Second stop position} = 60 - (20 + 15) = 60 - 35 = 25 \]

So, the second stop is at 25 miles from the start of the trip.

### Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between the Stops
We need to find out how far it is from the first stop (after 20 miles) to the second stop (at 25 miles).

Distance between the stops = \( 25 - 20 = 5 \) miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled **5 miles** between his first and second stops.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 5 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the high heels**:
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The second pair costs twice as much as the first pair.

2. **Calculate the cost of the second pair of high heels**:
   \[
   2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the combined cost of both pairs of high heels**:
   - Together, they cost: 
     \[
     33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Compare the combined cost of high heels with the boots**:
   - The boots and the high heels together should cost five dollars more than just the boots themselves.

5. **Set up an equation to find the cost of the boots**:
   Let \( x \) be the cost of the boots.
   According to the problem, the total cost (boots + high heels) is $5 more than the boots alone.
   So,
   \[
   x + 99 = x + 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x + 99 - 5 = x
   \]
   Simplifying gives us:
   \[
   x = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the boots cost \( \boxed{84} \) dollars.<|im_end|>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen.

Given that their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\).

**Step 2:** Set up an equation for their combined ages.

We know their total age is 162. Therefore,
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

**Step 3:** Solve for \(x\).

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[18x = 162\]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

So, Darrell's age (\(7x\)) is:
\[7 \times 9 = 63\]
And Allen's age (\(11x\)) is:
\[11 \times 9 = 99\]

**Step 4:** Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Allen's age currently is 99 years. Adding 10 years gives us:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is **109**.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

   - This friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
   
2. **Second friend's guess:**
   - The second friend said that their guess was 20 more than half of what the first friend guessed.
   - First friend's guess = 80
   - Half of 80 = 40
   - Second friend's guess = 40 + 20 = 60
   
3. **Third friend's guess:**
   - The third friend said their guess was 25% more than what the first friend guessed.
   - First friend's guess = 80
   - 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
   - Third friend's guess = 80 + 20 = 100
   
Now let's calculate the average of these guesses:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours John spends caring for his dogs in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the daily time spent on walking.
- John has 10 dogs.
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to walk.
- Therefore, the total daily time spent on walking is \( 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \) hours.

Step 2: Calculate the weekly time spent on walking.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total weekly time spent on walking is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) hours.

Step 3: Calculate the daily time spent on caring for their business.
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to care for their business.
- Since there are 10 dogs, the total daily time spent on caring for their business is \( 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \) hours.

Step 4: Calculate the weekly time spent on caring for their business.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- So, the total weekly time spent on caring for their business is \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \) hours.

Step 5: Add the total weekly time spent on walking and caring for their business.
- The total weekly time spent on all activities is \( 35 + 35 = 70 \) hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gold coins Gretchen has. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

Given that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can express the number of gold coins as:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

### Step 2: Set Up an Equation
We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Therefore, the sum of the number of silver coins and the number of gold coins must equal 110:
\[ S + G = 110 \]

Substitute the expression for \( G \) from Step 1 into this equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( S \)
Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

### Step 5: Find the Number of Gold Coins
Now that we know the number of silver coins (\( S = 40 \)), substitute back into the equation for gold coins (\( G = S + 30 \)):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.

   - We know that Raymond has 40 jewels.
   - Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.

First, calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, add 5 to this result to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels.

2. **Calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

Now, subtract 2 from Aaron's total:

To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will eat \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) yogurts.

2. **Determine the cost per set of 4 yogurts:**
   - The current price of 4 yogurts is $5.00.

3. **Calculate the number of sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy:**
   - To find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs, divide the total number of yogurts (60) by the number of yogurts in one set (4).
   - Number of sets = \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \).

4. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of sets:**

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Lego sets John initially had and then calculate how many he has after selling some.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets.
John sold each set for $15 and he has 13 sets.

\[ \text{Total money from selling Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 \]

\[
= 195
\]

So, John made $195 from selling his Lego sets.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money John spent on video games.
John bought 8 video games at $20 each.

\[ \text{Money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 \]

\[
= 160
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much money John has left after buying the video games.
John started with $195 and spent $160 on video games.

\[ \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 \]

\[
= 35
\]

So, John has $35 left after purchasing the video games.

### Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John still has.
We know that John originally had 13 Lego sets and now he has $35 left. Let \( x \) be the number of Lego sets he still has.

Since he spent $15 per set during the sale, if he has $35 left, he must have sold fewer than 7 sets because each set costs $15 (as he can't sell fractional sets).

Let’s check if he could have sold exactly 7 sets or more.

If he sold 7 sets,
\[ 7 \times 15 = 105 \]
He would have $90 left ($195 - $105).

If he sold 8 sets,
\[ 8 \times 15 = 120 \]
This exceeds his remaining money ($35), so he couldn’t have sold 8 sets.

Therefore, he must have sold less than 7 sets but enough to leave him with $35.

Given that each set was sold for $15 and he ended up having $35 left,
we can conclude that he must have sold one more set than what would leave him with $35, which means he must have sold 7 sets.

Thus, the number of Lego sets John still has is 0.

To determine how fast John runs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total running time:**
   - John runs for 3 days.
   - The first day he runs for 3 hours.

2. **Determine the running times for the remaining days:**
   - Each of the next two days (days 2 and 3) he runs for half the time of the first day.
   - Since he ran for 3 hours on the first day, his running time for the second day will be \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
   - Similarly, his running time for the third day will also be \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

3. **Sum up all the running times:**
   - Total running time = First day + Second day + Third day
   - Total running time = 3 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours
   - Total running time = 6 hours

4. **Calculate average speed:**
   - Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.
   - Distance = 60 miles
   - Time = 6 hours
   - Average speed = \(\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}}\)

                    question:
                    Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a ? rate of speed that is half as fast ? as . she can run. If she can skip at 3 miles per ! hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the rates for walking and skipping:**
   - Let \( w \) be the rate at which Dana walks.
   - According to the problem, Dana runs at a speed four times her walking speed, so her running speed is \( 4w \).
   - Her skipping speed is half of her running speed, so her skipping speed is \( \frac{4w}{2} = 2w \).

2. **Convert skipping speed from miles per hour to miles per minute:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert skipping speed to miles per minute.
     \[
     \text{Skipping speed (miles/minute)} = \frac{2w}{60} = \frac{w}{30}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance Dana travels in one hour:**
   - The total distance she travels in one hour is the sum of the distances covered during running and walking.
   - Running: \( 4w \times t \), where \( t \) is the time spent running.
   - Walking: \( w \times t \)
   - Total distance in one hour: 
     \[
     D_{\text{total}} = 4w \cdot t + w \cdot t = 5wt
     \]
   
4. **Relate the total distance to her skipping speed:**
   - Given that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, we can find \( t \):
     \[
     \frac{w}{30} = 3 \implies w = 90
     \]
   - Substitute \( w = 90 \) back into the equation for total distance:
     \[
     D_{\text{total}} = 5 \times 90t
     \]
   
5. **Calculate the total time spent on running and walking over six hours:**
   - One-third of the time is spent running, so \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours.
   - Two-thirds of the time is spent walking, so \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours.
   
6. **Find the total time spent on running and walking:**
   \[
   T_{\text{running}} = 2 \text{ hours}, \quad T_{\text{walking}} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - Total time: \( T_{\text{total}} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ hours} \)

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled in six hours:**
   - Since the total distance in one hour is \( 5wt \), and she has been running for 2 hours and walking for 4 hours, the total distance is:
     \[
     D_{\text{total}} = 5 \times 90 \times 2 = 900 \text{ miles}
     \]
     \[
     D_{\text{total}} = 5 \times 90 \times 4 = 1800 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Brandon's iPhone based on the ages of his friends' iPhones. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the age of Ben's iPhone.
- We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
- According to the information given, ""Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.""
  
   Therefore,
\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} \]
   
   Substituting the age of Suzy's iPhone:
\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

### Step 2: Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone.
- It is also stated that ""Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.""

   Therefore,
\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} \]
   
   Substituting the age of Ben's iPhone:
\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There is a great dragon named Perg.
   - Perg can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away.
   - Polly has a gold javelin which she can throw.
   - Polly holds a sapphire gemstone in her hand.
   - When Polly does not hold the gemstone, she can throw the javelin up to 400 feet.
   - Holding the gemstone allows her to throw the javelin further.

2. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the additional distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Without the gemstone (Polly throws the javelin 400 feet):
     \[
     400 = 4x
     \]
   - With the gemstone (Polly throws the javelin \( 400 + x \) feet):

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   From the equation without the gemstone:
   \[
   400 = 4x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{4} = 100
   \]

5. **Determine the Distance Polly Can Throw with the Gemstone:**
   \[
   400 + x = 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ feet}
   \]

6. **Compare with Dragon's Reach:**
   The dragon’s flames can reach up to 1000 feet. Since Polly can throw the javelin up to 500 feet with the gemstone, she cannot throw it beyond the dragon's reach.

7. **Conclusion:**
   Polly cannot stand outside the dragon's flames' reach while still hitting the dragon with the javelin.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is.}}

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of pies:**
   - Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces per pie:**
   - Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces from all pies combined is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

3. **Account for the remaining pieces at the end of the event:**
   - After the guests took some pieces, there were 14 pieces left.
   - This means that the total number of pieces taken plus the remaining pieces equals the initial total number of pieces.
   
   So, if \(T\) is the total number of pieces taken by the guests, then:
   \[
   T + 14 = 40

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the bag's total calories you can consume based on your current calorie intake and then compare it against your daily calorie target.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Given Information:
- A 300g bag of chips contains 250 calories per serving.
- There are 5 servings in the 300g bag.
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

#### Calculate the Total Calories in the Bag:
First, let’s calculate the total number of calories in the entire 300g bag.
\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories per serving} \times \text{Number of servings}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 250 \, \text{calories/serving} \times 5 \, \text{serving} = 1250 \, \text{calories}
\]

#### Determine How Many Calories You Can Consume:
Since you have already consumed 1800 calories, subtract that from the total calories in the bag to find out how many more calories you can consume.
\[
\text{Remaining calories} = \text{Total calories} - \text{Calories already consumed}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining calories} = 1250 \, \text{calories} - 1800 \, \text{calories} = -550 \, \text{calories}
\]

This result indicates that you cannot consume any additional calories because you have already exceeded your remaining calorie limit. 

#### Conclusion:
Given that you have already consumed 1800 calories, which exceeds your remaining 1500 calories (since \(2000 - 500\) represents the maximum allowable consumption before reaching your target), there are no additional calories left for consumption.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{0}}
\]<|im_end|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat

To determine Charlie's net profit from selling beeswax candles, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles Charlie can produce.
Charlie has one pound of beeswax and can make 10 tapered candles per pound.

\[
\text{Total candles} = \text{Number of pounds} \times \text{Candles per pound}
\]
\[
\text{Total candles} = 1 \times 10 = 10 \text{ candles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the candles.
Each candle is sold for $2.00.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 2 = \$20.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total costs.
Charlie uses one pound of beeswax and one wick for each candle, which costs him $10.00 in supplies.

Since he produces 10 candles:

\[
\text{Total Supplies Cost} = 10 \times \$10.00 = \$100.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total costs.

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$20.00 - \$100.00 = -\$80.00
\]

Therefore, Charlie's net profit after making and selling 20 candles is negative, indicating that he will incur an additional loss of $80.00 due to the high production costs despite selling at a favorable price.<|im_end|>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax

To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of articles written each day:**
   - **Monday:** She wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
     Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right)
     \]
     Simplifying this expression:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + (2 \times 1) = 5 + 2 = 7
     \]

   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
     Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Articles} = 5 (\text{Monday}) + 7 (\text{Tuesday}) + 14 (\text{Wednesday})
   \]
   Summing up these values:
   \[
   \text{Total Articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent writing articles based on the average time per article:**
   - The average time to write one article is 4 hours.
   \[
   \text{Total Time Spent Writing} = 26 \times 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   \text{Total Time Spent Writing} = 104 \text{ hours}
   \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of post-its**: Candice initially has 80 post-its.

2. **Post-its used**: She uses one post-it per cup of coffee.
   - At work, she places 220 post-its on the cups of coffee.
   - After placing these post-its, she has 23 post-its remaining.

Let's calculate how many post-its she used:
\[ \text{Used} = 220 + 23 = 243 \]

Now we know she used 243 post-its from her initial 80 post-its:
\[ 80 - \text{used} = 80 - 243 \]
Since this results in a negative value (which isn't possible), there must be an error or misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

Given: 
- Initial number of post-its = 80
- Used post-its = 220 (on cups) + 23 (remaining)

Re-calculate correctly:
\[ \text{Total post-its after purchase} = \text{initial} + \text{post-its bought} \]

We need to find the total post-its after buying the new pack. We also know that after using them, she still has 23 left over.

Let \( x \) represent the number of post-its in the new pack she bought.

So, the equation becomes:
\[ 80 + x - 243 = 23 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 243 = 23 \]
\[ x - 163 = 23 \]
\[ x = 186 \]

Therefore, the number of post-its in the package that she purchased was **186**.<|im_end|>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blue ties.
   - Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he also buys \( 2B \) red ties.

2. **Calculate the total cost for blue ties:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - If John spends $200 on blue ties, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     40B = 200
     \]
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for red ties:**
   - Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie.
   - Therefore, each red tie costs:
     \[
     40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - John buys \( 2B \) red ties, so the total cost for red ties is:
     \[
     60 \times 2B = 60 \times 2 \times 5 = 60 \times 10 = 600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - Add the cost of blue ties to the cost of red ties:
     \[
     200 \text{ (blue ties)} + 600 \text{ (red ties)} = 800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).<|im_end|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**:
   - The length of the wire is given as 4 feet.
   - We need to convert this to inches because the length of the pieces we're cutting from the wire is given in inches (6 inches).

   Conversion: 
   \[
   1 foot = 12 inches
   \]
   So,
   \[
   4 feet = 4 × 12 inches = 48 inches
   \]

2. **Determine how many pieces can be cut**:
   - We have a total length of 48 inches of wire.
   - Each piece will be 6 inches long.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces**:
   To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide 48 by 6:
   \[
   \frac{48}{6} = 8
   \]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire that were 6 inches long.

Final Answer: {The final answer is} 8.<|im_end|>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

                    question:
                    Richard lives in ; an apartment building with 15 floors. Each floor contains 8 units, and 3/4 of the building is occupied. What's the total number of unoccupied units In the building?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.

First, find the total number of units per floor:
\[ \text{Units per floor} = 8 \]

Next, calculate the total number of units for all floors:
\[ \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 120 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of units occupied.
- According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.
  
To find out how many units are occupied, multiply the total number of units by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
\[ \text{Occupied units} = \text{Total units} \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 90 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.
- To find the number of unoccupied units, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Substitute the values obtained in Step 2 into this equation:
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units} \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 30 \]

### Conclusion:
The total number of unoccupied units in the building is **30**.<|im_end|>","The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Lloyd makes from selling his eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate daily earnings:**
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - He sells eggs at $2 per dozen.

First, convert the number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings per day:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 21 \times 2 = \$42 \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, multiply the daily earnings by 7:
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 42 \times 7 = \$294 \]

### Final Answer:

                    question:
                    Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at ; a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Tom to sail back from point 1 to point 2. We'll break down the journey into two parts: the trip from point 1 to point 2 and the return trip.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the trip from point 1 to point 2.
Tom's speed on the way back (from point 2 to point 1) is given as 6 mph.

- Distance from point 1 to point 2: Let's denote this distance as \(d\).
- Time = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{d}{6} \).

We don't know the exact distance \(d\) yet, so let's call this time \(t_1\):

\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{6} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total time for the round trip.
Since the total time for the round trip is the same as the sum of the times for the one-way trips:

\[ T_{total} = t_1 + t_2 \]
where \( t_2 \) is the time taken for the return trip.

From Step 1, we have \( t_1 = \frac{d}{6} \). Now, we need to find \( t_2 \), which is the time for the return trip. 

### Step 3: Use the formula for distance and speed.
The average speed for the entire journey is half the sum of the speeds for both legs because the distances are equal but in opposite directions. This means that the average speed is simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds.

Average speed \( v_{avg} \) = \(\frac{10 + 6}{2}\) = 8 mph.

Now, using the formula for distance (\( d = v \times t \)) where \( d \) is the distance, \( v \) is the average speed, and \( t \) is time:

\[ d = 8 \times t \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{d}{8} \]

Substituting \( t_1 \) from Step 1:

\[ t_1 = \frac{d}{6} \]

So,

\[ t = \frac{\frac{d}{6}}{8} = \frac{d}{48} \]

### Step 4: Find the actual distance \( d \).
We need to express \( d \) in terms of time. Since the average speed is 8 mph and the time for the return trip is \( t_2 \), we use the relationship between distance, speed, and time:

\[ d = 8 \times t_2 \]

But we also know:

\[ t_2 = \frac{d}{6} \]

Substitute \( t_2 \) in the equation for \( d \):

\[ d = 8 \times \left(\frac{d}{6}\right) \]

Simplify:

\[ d = \frac{8d}{6} \]

Divide both sides by \( d \):

\[ 1 = \frac{8}{6} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ d = 6 \text{ miles} \]

It will take Tom 4 hours to complete his round trip. The final answer is:

The final answer is: 4 hours.<|im_end|>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                    question:
                    Uriah's book bag , is getting . too . heavy for him. . He needs to remove : 15 pounds : from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his , toys weigh 1/2 pound each. : If he removes 30 , comic ? books, how many toys does he need to remove?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total weight of all items in Uriah's book bag.
Let \( W \) represent the current weight of Uriah's book bag.

### Step 2: Calculate the weight removed from the book bag.
Uriah wants to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.

### Step 3: Subtract the weight removed from the total weight.
After removing 15 pounds, the remaining weight in the book bag is:
\[ W - 15 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of comic books Uriah has left after removing some.
Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound. Let \( C \) represent the initial number of comic books.
If Uriah removes 30 comic books, then the number of comic books left is:
\[ C - 30 \]

### Step 5: Express the remaining weight as a function of the number of comic books left.
Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, the remaining weight can be represented as:
\[ \text{Remaining Weight} = \left( C - 30 \right) \times \frac{1}{4} \]

### Step 6: Set up an equation based on the remaining weight.
We know that the remaining weight must equal \( W - 15 \). Therefore:
\[ \left( C - 30 \right) \times \frac{1}{4} = W - 15 \]

### Step 7: Solve for \( C \).
Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:
\[ C - 30 = 4 \left( W - 15 \right) \]
\[ C - 30 = 4W - 60 \]
Add 30 to both sides:
\[ C = 4W - 30 + 30 \]
\[ C = 4W \]

### Step 8: Substitute \( C \) back into the expression for the remaining weight.
Now substitute \( C = 4W \) into the remaining weight equation:
\[ \left( 4W - 30 \right) \times \frac{1}{4} = W - 15 \]

### Step 9: Simplify the equation.
Distribute the \( \frac{1}{4} \):
\[ W - \frac{30}{4} = W - 15 \]
\[ W - 7.5 = W - 15 \]

### Step 10: Solve for \( W \).
Subtract \( W \) from both sides:
\[ -7.5 = -15 \]

This results in no solution since we have reached a contradiction. This indicates that Uriah cannot achieve the desired weight reduction with only comic books or toys. 

### Conclusion:
Uriah cannot remove exactly 15 pounds from his book bag using just comic books and toys without exceeding the total weight. The problem setup seems to be flawed or requires additional constraints not provided here. Therefore, there is no valid number of toy removals that would result in exactly 15 pounds being removed from the book bag under given conditions.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} No feasible solution exists for the described scenario.<|im_end|>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by the mechanic on both days and then determine which day had more revenue.

### Step 1: Calculate Revenue on Thursday
- **Truck Tires**: The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire.
  - Number of truck tires repaired = 6
  - Revenue from truck tires = \( 6 \times 60 \)

- **Car Tires**: The mechanic charges $40 per car tire.
  - Number of car tires repaired = 4
  - Revenue from car tires = \( 4 \times 40 \)

Now, let's perform the calculations:

- Revenue from truck tires = \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \)
- Revenue from car tires = \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \)

Total revenue on Thursday = \( 360 + 160 = 520 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Revenue on Friday
- **Truck Tires**: No truck tires are repaired since only car tires are repaired.
  - Revenue from truck tires = \( 0 \) (since no truck tires are repaired)

- **Car Tires**: The mechanic charges $40 per car tire.
  - Number of car tires repaired = 12
  - Revenue from car tires = \( 12 \times 40 \)

Now, let's perform the calculation:

- Revenue from car tires = \( 12 \times 40 = 480 \)

Total revenue on Friday = \( 0 + 480 = 480 \)

### Step 3: Determine Which Day Had Higher Revenue
Comparing the revenues:
- Thursday's revenue = $520
- Friday's revenue = $480

Since $520 > $480$, the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday.

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of adopted kittens for each cat.
- **Patchy**: The problem states that Patchy has had ""thrice the number"" of adopted kittens as those she was adopted from. Since she was adopted from a local animal shelter where there were 7 kittens, Patchy must have had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) adopted kittens.
- **Trixie**: Trixie has had 12 adopted kittens.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of adopted kittens in the household.
- Total adopted kittens = Patchy's adopted kittens + Trixie's adopted kittens
- Total adopted kittens = \(21 + 12\)
- Total adopted kittens = \(33\)

### Step 3: Add these to the number of kittens already in the household.
- The family already had 7 adopted kittens (from the shelter) plus the 7 they adopted.
- Total current kittens = Adopted kittens from shelter + Adopted kittens from adoption + Current household kittens
- Total current kittens = \(7 + 7 + 33\)
- Total current kittens = \(57\)

                    Peter plans ; to go to the movies this week. He always gets : a ticket for $7 and popcorn for $7. : If he has . 42 dollars for the week, how many times can he go to the movies?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per visit to the movies:**
   - Ticket price = $7
   - Popcorn price = $7
   - Total cost per visit = $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14

2. **Determine how much money Peter has in total:**
   - Money available = $0.42

3. **Divide the total amount of money by the cost per visit to find out how many visits he can make:**
   \[
   \text{Number of visits} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per visit}} = \frac{0.42}{14}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{0.42}{14} = 0.03
   \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   Since the number of visits must be an integer (he cannot go to the movies partway through), and the result is less than one, Peter cannot afford to go to the movies even once.

**Conclusion:** 
Peter cannot go to the movies at all because he only has enough money for approximately three-quarters of a visit. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total weight capacity of the bridge.
- The bridge can carry up to **5000 pounds**.

### Step 2: Calculate the weight of the driver and the empty truck.
- The total weight of the driver and the empty truck is **3755 pounds**.

### Step 3: Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's total capacity to find out how much additional weight is allowed.
- Total weight capacity - Weight of the driver and empty truck = Additional weight allowance
\[ \text{Additional weight allowance} = 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 4: Determine the weight of one box.
- Each box weighs **15 pounds**.

### Step 5: Calculate how many boxes can fit within the remaining weight allowance (after accounting for the weight of the driver and the empty truck).
- Number of boxes that can fit = Additional weight allowance / Weight per box
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is **83**.

### Final Answer:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the base cost after adding tips:**
   - Final bill before additional fees = $40.00
   - Tip added by Stephen = $4.00
   - Total amount including tips = $40.00 + $4.00 = $44.00

2. **Apply the 25% delivery fee:**
   - Delivery fee rate = 25%
   - Delivery fee amount = 25% of $44.00 = 0.25 * $44.00 = $11.00

3. **Add the delivery fee to the total amount:**
   - New total amount after delivery fee = $44.00 + $11.00 = $55.00

4. **Subtract the tip from the new total:**
   - Final amount after subtracting the tip = $55.00 - $4.00 = $51.00

To determine how many oranges are good in the basket, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of unripe oranges.**
- We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- The total number of oranges is 25.

\[
\text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of sour oranges.**
- There are 2 sour oranges.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of bad oranges (unripe + sour).**
- Bad oranges = Unripe oranges + Sour oranges
- Bad oranges = 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 7

**Step 4: Subtract the number of bad oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.**

\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total number of oranges} - \text{Number of bad oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 7 = 18

                    question:
                    Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.  She pays $500 for the material to make , it and then another : $800 for the jeweler to construct : it. ;  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much : did she pay?

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janet paid for the brooch after considering all the costs involved.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of materials**
Janet initially pays $500 for the material.

**Step 2: Add the cost of the jeweler's construction**
She also pays an additional $800 for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

**Step 3: Calculate the insurance cost**
After paying for the materials and the construction, Janet has to pay 10% of the total cost (which includes both the materials and the construction) as insurance.

Let's denote the total cost before insurance as \( T \).

\[
T = 500 + 800 = 1300
\]

So, the total cost before insurance is:

\[
T = 1300
\]

Now, let's calculate the insurance cost which is 10% of \( T \):

\[
\text{Insurance Cost} = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid including the insurance**

Finally, we add the insurance cost to the original total cost:

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Marcy has accumulated over her 40-year career:**
   - She receives an annual pension of $50,000 for 40 years.
   - Total earnings = Annual pension × Number of years = $50,000 × 40 = $2,000,000.

2. **Determine how much she would receive from the pension plan if she continues working until age 60 (after becoming entitled to 5% of the pension value):**
   - After becoming entitled at age 20, she will continue working until age 60, which is 40 years.
   - At age 20, she receives $50,000 per year.
   - From age 20 to age 60, she will receive this amount annually for 40 years.
   - Total earnings during this period = Annual pension × Number of years = $50,000 × 40 = $2,000,000.

3. **Calculate the remaining balance in her account after 40 years:**
   - Since both scenarios involve earning $2,000,000 over 40 years, there is no additional principal left in the account after she stops working at age 40.
   - Therefore, the total amount she can withdraw after becoming entitled is the same as the total earnings during her career.

4. **Determine the amount she will receive annually after becoming entitled to 5% of the pension value:**
   - Let \( P \) be the total amount she can withdraw starting at age 20.
   - After becoming entitled, she starts receiving 5% of \( P \) per year.
   - The annual amount received after entitlement = \( 0.05 \times P \).

Since the total amount she can withdraw remains $2,000,000 regardless of when she becomes entitled, we conclude that the amount she receives annually after becoming entitled will be the same as the annual amount she was receiving before becoming entitled.

Therefore, the annual pension after she becomes entitled will be:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of months in a year
There are 12 months in a year.

### Step 2: Determine how many months fall into each half of the year
- Half of the year is 6 months (since \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) months).

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the first half of the year
Aleena's subscription costs $140 per month. For the first 6 months:
\[ \text{Cost for first half of the year} = 140 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost for first half of the year} = 840 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost for the second half of the year
For the remaining 6 months (the second half), the company charges 10% less than the original rate. The reduced rate is:
\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 140 - (140 \times 0.10) \]
\[ \text{Reduced rate} = 140 - 14 = 126 \]

Now, calculate the cost for the second half of the year:
\[ \text{Cost for second half of the year} = 126 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Cost for second half of the year} = 756 \]

### Step 5: Sum up the costs from both halves of the year
Add the cost of the first half to the cost of the second half:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 840 + 756 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1696 \]

### Final Answer
By the end of the year, Aleena has paid a total of $1696 for the streaming service.<|im_end|>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance Sophia has already driven.
Sophia has traveled 100 miles since her last refill.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance before refilling.
Since the tank holds 12 gallons and Sophia needs 4 gallons to fill it up, we need to determine if she has enough fuel left after driving 100 miles.

### Step 3: Calculate the fuel consumption per mile.
First, we need to find out how much fuel is consumed per mile. We do this by dividing the total amount of fuel used (4 gallons) by the number of miles driven (100 miles).

\[ \text{Fuel consumption per mile} = \frac{\text{Total fuel used}}{\text{Distance driven}} = \frac{4 \text{ gallons}}{100 \text{ miles}} = 0.04 \text{ gallons per mile} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total fuel consumption for 100 miles.
Now, using the fuel consumption rate calculated above, we can find out how much fuel is consumed over 100 miles:

\[ \text{Fuel consumed for 100 miles} = 100 \text{ miles} \times 0.04 \text{ gallons per mile} = 4 \text{ gallons} \]

### Step 5: Verify the fuel consumption matches the information given.
We were told that Sophia needed to add 4 gallons of gas to reach full capacity. Since she was able to travel 100 miles without needing another fill-up, this confirms our calculations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations, Sophia can drive a maximum of **100 miles** on a single tank of gas. This is because she had already driven 100 miles when she reached the point where adding more gas would be necessary, meaning she could continue at her usual speed until the next refill.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how much time Jim spends on reading:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
   - He then decides to read for half as long as he watched TV.
   - Reading time = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \) hours = 1 hour.

2. **Calculate total reading time per session:**
   - Jim reads for 1 hour each time he goes to bed after watching TV.

3. **Calculate total reading time over 3 sessions per week:**
   - Total reading time per week = \( 3 \times 1 \) hour/session = 3 hours/week.

4. **Calculate total reading time over 4 weeks:**
   - Total reading time over 4 weeks = \( 4 \times 3 \) hours/week = 12 hours.

5. **Sum up the time spent on both activities (TV + Reading):**
   - Time spent on TV = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week.
   - Time spent on reading = 12 hours/month.
   - Total time spent on both activities in 4 weeks = \( 14 \) hours/week + \( 12 \) hours/month.

6. **Convert total weekly reading time into monthly reading time:**
   - Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can use this ratio to convert weekly reading time to monthly reading time.
   - Monthly reading time = \( \frac{12 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ weeks}} \times 4 \text{ weeks/year} = 12 \text{ hours/year} \).

Therefore, the final answer is that Jim spends a total of 12 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","He reads for 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 hour a night

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of teams per school:**
   - Each school sends two teams (one for girls' basketball and one for boys' basketball).
   - Each team consists of 5 players.
   - Therefore, each school sends \(2 \times 5 = 10\) players.

2. **Calculate the total number of players across all schools:**
   - There are 4 schools.
   - Each school sends 10 players.
   - Total players = \(4 \times 10 = 40\).

3. **Account for coaches:**
   - Each school sends a coach for each team.
   - There are 4 schools, so there are \(4\) coaches in total.

4. **Sum up all participants:**
   - Players from the teams: \(40\)
   - Coaches: \(4\)

Therefore, the total number of people who have all of the schools sent is \(40 + 4 = 44\).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(44\).<|im_end|>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

                    A treasure hunter found , a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than the ? rubies.   How : many of , the gems were there in the ? chest?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of rubies:**
   - The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - We know there are 175 diamonds.
   - Therefore, the number of rubies = Diamonds - 35
     \[
     \text{Rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of emeralds:**
   - According to the problem, there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies.
   - Since we've determined there are 140 rubies, we can calculate the number of emeralds using the ratio given.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of emeralds.
   - Given \( E = 2 \times \text{Rubies} \)
     \[
     \text{Emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
     \]

3. **Summarize the total number of gems:**
   - Now we have calculated the number of each type of gem.
   - Total number of gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
     \[
     \text{Total Gems} = 175 (Diamonds) + 140 (Rubies) + 280 (Emeralds) = 695
     \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 695.

**Final Answer:** 
\boxed{695}<|im_end|>","There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys in the school:**
   - We know that there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of girls.
   - According to the information given, \( G = 60 \).
   - Since there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys \( B \) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     B = 2 \times G = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   - The total number of students \( T \) is the sum of the number of boys and the number of girls.
     \[
     T = B + G = 120 + 60 = 180
     \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers based on the student-to-teacher ratio:**
   - We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher.
   - Let \( T_t \) represent the number of teachers.
   - Using the ratio, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{T}{T_t} = 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( T_t \):
     \[
     T_t = \frac{T}{5}
     \]
   - Substituting \( T = 180 \):
     \[
     T_t = \frac{180}{5} = 36
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the number of teachers in Dr. Wertz's school is \( 36 \).

To determine how much money Bailey started with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance.
2. Add this amount to the total amount of money she had at the end of 8 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received from her weekly allowance.
Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total amount of money she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Step 2: Add the amount of money from her allowance to the total amount of money she had at the end of 8 weeks.
At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. So, we add the $40 from her allowance to $100:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Judy makes from her dance classes over one week. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of classes Judy teaches each day.
- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):** Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- **Saturday:** Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturdays.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of classes Judy teaches in a week.
- **Weekdays:** \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week}\)
  \[
  = 25 \text{ classes}
  \]
- **Saturdays:** \(8 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ day/week}\)
  \[

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Judy earns.
She charges $15.00 per student, so for 495 students:
\[
495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7,425.00

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money raised from selling both brownies and cheesecakes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the revenue from brownies:**
   - Each brownie costs $3.
   - Tommy sold 43 brownies.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = \text{Price per brownie} \times \text{Number of brownies}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 3 \times 43
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 129

2. **Calculate the revenue from cheesecakes:**
   - Each cheesecake costs $4.
   - Tommy sold 23 cheesecakes.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = \text{Price per cheesecake} \times \text{Number of cheesecakes}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 4 \times 23
\]

\[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cellphones.**

Shiela bought 5 cellphones at $150 each.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount including the interest.**

A 2% interest rate will apply to the total cost.

\[ \text{Interest on total cost} = \$750 \times 0.02 = \$15 \]

So, the total amount Shiela needs to pay before any installments includes the interest.

\[ \text{Total amount before installments} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment over 3 months.**

Now, divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she pays each month.

\[ \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay **\$255 per month for 3 months**.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total square footage of all four levels in the sandcastle and then find the average square footage per level.

Step 1: Determine the square footage for each level.
- The top level (level 4) has an area of 16 square feet.

Since each subsequent level has half the area of the one beneath it, we can calculate the areas of the other three levels:

Level 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) square feet
Level 2: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) square feet
Level 1: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) square feet

Step 2: Calculate the total square footage of all four levels.
Total square footage = Level 1 + Level 2 + Level 3 + Level 4
\[ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 20 \]

Step 3: Find the average square footage per level.
Average square footage per level = Total square footage / Number of levels
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of each level is 5 square feet.<|im_end|>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

                    question:
                    Cecilia ; just ? bought a new , puppy. According to . her veterinarian, she . has to feed the puppy . 1 ! cup of dog food , every day ; for the ; first 180 days.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days Cecilia needs to feed the puppy.
- The first part of the diet lasts for 180 days.
- The second part of the diet lasts until the puppy is done growing (let's assume it's not finished yet).

Since we don't have information about when the puppy is ""done"" growing, we'll consider the entire year as the period.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of dog food needed during the first 180 days.
- Each day, the puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food.
- For 180 days, the total amount of dog food required is \( 180 \times 1 = 180 \) cups.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of dog food needed after the first 180 days.
- After 180 days, the puppy requires 2 cups of dog food per day.
- There are 365 days in a year (we're assuming a standard year without leap years).
- Therefore, the remaining days in a year after 180 days is \( 365 - 180 = 185 \) days.

- During these 185 days, the puppy consumes \( 185 \times 2 = 370 \) cups of dog food.

### Step 4: Sum up the total amount of dog food needed.
- Total dog food required = Dog food for the first 180 days + Dog food for the remaining days
\[ 180 + 370 = 550 \] cups.

### Step 5: Determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will need.
- One bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- To find out how many bags are needed for 550 cups, divide the total amount of dog food by the number of cups per bag:
\[ \frac{550}{110} = 5 \]

Therefore, Cecilia will need **5** bags of dog food in the first year.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 5}}
\]<|im_end|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    If Raymond does half ? as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond ; and David ; do if Sarah does : 400 pounds of laundry.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond (R), Sarah (S), and David (D). We are given that:

1. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah: \( R = \frac{1}{2} S \)
2. Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David: \( S = 4 D \)

We also know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, so:

3. \( S = 400 \) pounds

First, let's find out how much laundry David does:

From equation 3, since \( S = 400 \):
\[ D = \frac{S}{4} \]
Substituting \( S = 400 \) into the equation:
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, using the relationship between Sarah and David from equations 1 and 2, we can determine how much laundry Raymond does:

From equation 1:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} S \]
Substituting \( S = 400 \):
\[ R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \]

So, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find the difference between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond and David:

Difference = \( R - D \)
Substituting \( R = 200 \) and \( D = 100 \):
\[ Difference = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond does compared to David is **100 pounds**.<|im_end|>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost per flower between two different purchasing options for Vincent.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost per Flower for Each Option

**Option A (Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50):**
- Number of flowers per package = 3
- Total number of flowers Vincent wants to buy = 18
- Number of packages needed = \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \)
- Cost per package = $2.50
- Total cost for 18 flowers = $2.50 × 6 = $15.00

**Option B (Packages of 2 flowers for $1.00):**
- Number of flowers per package = 2
- Total number of flowers Vincent wants to buy = 18
- Number of packages needed = \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \)
- Cost per package = $1.00
- Total cost for 18 flowers = $1.00 × 9 = $9.00

### Step 2: Compare the Costs

- **Cost per flower for Option A:** 
  - Cost per flower = \( \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of flowers}} \) = \( \frac{15.00}{18} \approx \$0.83 \)

- **Cost per flower for Option B:** 
  - Cost per flower = \( \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of flowers}} \) = \( \frac{9.00}{18} = \$0.50 \)

### Step 3: Determine Which Option is Better

Since Option B has a lower cost per flower ($0.50), it is cheaper.

### Step 4: Calculate Savings

- Difference in cost per flower between Options A and B: \( 0.83 - 0.50 = \$0.33 \)

### Final Answer:
By choosing Option B, which offers a better deal at a lower cost per flower, Vincent saves approximately $0.33 on his purchase of 18 flowers.<|im_end|>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

John initially pays $100 for grooming services.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of the discount.
The groomer offers a 30% discount on the total cost.

First, we need to find out what 30% of $100 is:
\[ \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 100 = \$30 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price.
Now, subtract the discount from the initial price:
\[ \text{Grooming Cost} = \$100 - \$30 = \$70 \]

Therefore, the final cost of grooming after applying the 30% discount is $\boxed{\$70}$.<|im_end|>","The groomer gave a 100*.3=$<<100*.3=30>>30 discount

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much water the two girls got.
- Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total amount of water.
- The total amount of water is 24 liters.

First, calculate the amount each girl gets:
\[ \text{Amount per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Amount per girl} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls:
\[ \text{Total for both girls} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 2: Subtract the water taken by the girls from the total amount.
- Total amount of water initially: 24 liters.
- Water taken by the girls: 8 liters.

Subtract these amounts:
\[ \text{Remaining water after girls} = 24 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Remaining water after girls} = 16 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much water the boy took.
- The boy took 6 liters of water.

### Step 4: Subtract the water taken by the boy from the remaining amount.
- Remaining water after girls: 16 liters.
- Water taken by the boy: 6 liters.

Subtract these amounts:
\[ \text{Remaining water after the boy} = 16 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Remaining water after the boy} = 10 \text{ liters} \]

### Final Answer:
The final amount of water left is 10 liters. {The final answer is} 10 liters.<|im_end|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Alex's weight
First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. The problem states that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times his own weight.

Let \( A \) represent Alex's weight.
Given that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times his own weight, we can write:
\[ A = 4A - 2 \]

### Step 2: Solve for Alex's weight
We can simplify this equation to find Alex's weight:
\[ A + 2 = 4A \]
Subtract \( A \) from both sides:
\[ 2 = 3A \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 \text{ (rounded)} \]

So, Alex's weight is approximately **0.67** pounds.

### Step 3: Calculate Grace's weight
Grace weighs 125 pounds.

### Step 4: Find their combined weight
Now, we add Grace's and Alex's weights together:
\[ \text{Combined Weight} = 125 + 0.67 \]

### Step 5: Perform the addition
Add the numbers:
\[ 125 + 0.67 = 125.67 \]

Therefore, their combined weight is **125.67** pounds.

2. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of wins.
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of losses.

3. **Set up equations based on given information**:
   - We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost: 
     \[ W = L + 8 \]

4. **Use the total number of games equation**:
   - Since all games were either won or lost (no ties), we have:
     \[ W + L = 22 \]

5. **Substitute the expression for \( W \) from Step 2 into the Total Games Equation**:
   - Replace \( W \) in the total games equation with \( L + 8 \):
     \[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

6. **Simplify and solve for \( L \)**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[ 2L = 14 \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[ L = 7 \]

7. **Find the number of wins using the value of \( L \)**:
   - Substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
     \[ W = 7 + 8 \]
     \[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the total number of rings:

1. **First Ring**:
   - It rang 4 times.

2. **Second Ring**:
   - It rang 3 times longer than the first ring.
   - First ring: 4 times.
   - Second ring: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Ring**:
   - It rang half as much as the second ring.
   - Second ring: 12 times.
   - Third ring: \(12 / 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we sum up all the rings from each event:
- First ring: 4 times.
- Second ring: 12 times.
- Third ring: 6 times.

Total number of rings:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the initial salary**: According to the information given, the initial monthly salary per employee is $600.

2. **Calculate the yearly increase rate**: The company increases the salaries by 10% annually.

3. **Calculate the salary after three more years of service**:
   - Since Sylvie will have worked for 8 years (5 + 3), we need to find out how much she will be paid at that point.
   - First, let's calculate her salary after one year (which would be after 5 years).
   - After one year, her salary will be: \( \text{Current Salary} + (\text{Current Salary} \times \frac{10}{100}) = \$600 + (\$600 \times \frac{10}{100}) = \$600 + \$60 = \$660 \).

4. **Calculate the new salary after two more years (after another year)**:
   - Now, her salary will increase again based on the same 10% increase.
   - Her salary after two more years will be: \( \$660 + (\$660 \times \frac{10}{100}) = \$660 + \$66 = \$726 \).

5. **Calculate the new salary after three more years (after another year)**:
   - Finally, her salary will increase yet again.
   - Her salary after three more years will be: \( \$726 + (\$726 \times \frac{10}{100}) = \$726 + \$72.6 = \$798.6 \).

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be $\boxed{\$798.6}$, rounded to two decimal places.<|im_end|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let \( M \) represent the number of copies sold by Marilyn.
Let \( H \) represent the number of copies sold by Harald.

**Step 2: Understand the Relationship Between Sales**
According to the information given, ""Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.""

This can be represented mathematically as:
\[ M = 10H \]

**Step 3: Combine Sales Data**
It's stated that together, they sold 88,000 copies. This can be written as:
\[ M + H = 88,000 \]

**Step 4: Substitute the Relationship into the Combined Sales Equation**
Since we know from Step 2 that \( M = 10H \), we can substitute \( 10H \) for \( M \) in the equation from Step 3:
\[ 10H + H = 88,000 \]

**Step 5: Simplify the Equation**
Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

**Step 6: Solve for \( H \)**
Divide both sides by 11 to isolate \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

Therefore, Harald sold **8,000 copies**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}. Harald sold 8,000 copies.<|im_end|>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how many guests actually attend**
- Christina invited 16 friends.
- Since 1/4 of attendees don't show up, we need to find out how many won't come.

\[ \text{Number who won't come} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

So, 4 guests won't show up.

**Step 2: Determine the number of guests that do attend**
\[ \text{Attendees} = \text{Total invited} - \text{Guests who won't come} \]
\[ \text{Attendees} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

So, 12 guests will attend her party.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the gift bags**
- Each gift bag costs $2.
- Total guests (including those who didn't show up) would be 16, but only 12 will attend.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per gift bag} \times \text{Number attending} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2 \times 12 \]

Now calculate the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2 \times 12 = \$24 \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: The final answer is \$24.<|im_end|>","She needs 12 gift bags because 16 x .75 = <<16*.75=12>>12

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much potato salad Ted needs for his picnic, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the picnic**
- There are 20 adults.
- There are 5 children.

Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of children
= 20 adults + 5 children
= 25 people

**Step 2: Determine the amount of potato salad one person will consume**
We know that an adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.

Therefore, each person will eat:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{20 \text{ adults}} = 0.5 \text{ lbs per person} \]

Since there are 5 children, the total consumption by children would be:
\[ 5 \times 0.5 \text{ lbs/person} = 2.5 \text{ lbs} \]

**Step 3: Add the potato salad needed for all adults and children together**

For adults:
\[ 20 \times 0.5 \text{ lbs/adult} = 10 \text{ lbs} \]

For children:
\[ 2.5 \text{ lbs/child} \]

Total required potato salad:
\[ 10 \text{ lbs (adults)} + 2.5 \text{ lbs (children)} = 12.5 \text{ lbs} \]

**Conclusion:**
Ted needs to bring **12.5 pounds** of potato salad to the dinosaur! picnic so that it has enough for everyone.<|im_end|>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has based on the given information and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - We know that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Therefore, Marcia's number of pets = 4 (Cindy's pets) + 2 = 6 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Therefore, Jan's number of pets = 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

3. **Sum up the total number of pets for all three people:**
   - Cindy has 4 pets.
   - Marcia has 6 pets.
   - Jan has 18 pets.
   - Total number of pets = 4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets).

Let's perform the addition:

\[ 4 + 6 + 18 \]

First, add 4 and 6:

\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Then, add the result to 18:

\[ 10 + 18 = 28 \]

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each child based on the given relationships between their ages. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( J \) represent the age of Jackson.
- Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, we can write: 
\[ A = J + 5 \]

- Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore,
\[ C - (J + 5) = 2 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ C - J = 7 \]

### Step 2: Determine Corey's Age
Since James is 10 years old and he is 1 year younger than Corey, we can write:
\[ J + 1 = 10 \]
From this equation, we find:
\[ J = 9 \]

### Step 3: Find Corey's Age
Using Corey’s relationship to his own age:
\[ C = J + 7 \]
Substituting \( J = 9 \):
\[ C = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Ages
Now let's verify if these ages satisfy all conditions:
- **Amy** is indeed 5 years older than Jackson (\( A = J + 5 \)):
\[ A = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

- **Amy** is 2 years younger than Corey (\( A = C - 2 \)):
\[ 14 = 16 - 2 \]

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Conclusion
Thus, Jackson is 9 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} The age of Jackson is 9.<|im_end|>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how long it took Lee to complete the 400-meter hurdles before improving.
2. Calculate the new time for Gerald after he improves due to his diet.
3. Compare the times to find out who is faster.

### Step 1: Determine Lee's original time
Let's denote Lee's original time as \( T_L \). According to the problem, Lee was 2 seconds faster than Gerald initially. So, if Gerald's time is \( T_G \), then:
\[ T_L = T_G - 2 \]

Since we don't have the exact value of \( T_L \) from the problem statement, let's proceed without it for now. We'll use the given information about Gerald's improvement later.

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's improved time
Gerald's improved time after changing his diet is 10% faster. This means his new time \( T_{G_{improved}} \) is:
\[ T_{G_{improved}} = T_G + 0.1T_G = 1.1T_G \]

### Step 3: Find out who is faster between Lee and Gerald
We know that Lee's time is 38 seconds. So, we need to compare \( T_L \) (Lee's original time) with \( T_{G_{improved}} \).

From the equation above, we have:
\[ T_{G_{improved}} = 1.1T_G \]
This implies:
\[ T_G = \frac{T_{G_{improved}}}{1.1} \]

However, since we don't have the exact value of \( T_L \), we cannot directly calculate \( T_{G_{improved}} \) without knowing \( T_L \). Instead, let's assume \( T_L \) exists and we can determine \( T_{G_{improved}} \) based on the relationship between their times.

If we assume \( T_L \) is known or can be calculated, then we can substitute it into the equations to find \( T_{G_{improved}} \).

For example, if \( T_L = x \):
\[ T_G = x + 2 \]
Then:
\[ T_{G_{improved}} = 1.1(x + 2) \]

But since we don't have the actual values, we can only express the relationship between the times.

### Conclusion
Given the information provided, we cannot definitively state who is faster without knowing the exact original times of both athletes. However, if we were to assume the conditions and relationships correctly, we would find that Gerald would improve significantly but still not surpass Lee's initial performance due to the difference in their starting points.

So, the final answer should reflect that Gerald's improved time will likely be less than Lee's original time but not necessarily equal to or exceed Lee's time because of the improvement factor applied to his running speed.

10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.

   - The number of rabbit pets is 12 less than the sum of the number of pet dogs and cat pets.
   - Let's denote the number of pet dogs as \(D\), the number of cat pets as \(C\), and the number of rabbit pets as \(R\).

2. **Express the relationship mathematically:**
   \[
   R = D + C - 12
   \]

3. **Use the given information about the number of dogs:**
   - We know that the number of dogs (\(D\)) is 60.
   \[
   D = 60
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of cat pets using the ratio given:**
   - The ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1.
   \[
   \text{Number of cats} = \frac{\text{Number of dogs}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the number of dogs:
   \[
   C = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Substitute the values into the equation for rabbit pets:**
   \[
   R = 60 + 30 - 12

4. **Calculate the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout organization:**
   - Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout organization from the total number of girls.

\[
Number \;of \;girls \;not \;in \;the \;Girl \;Scout \;organization = 120 - 80 = 40

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate how much time James slept:**
   - Harry slept 9 hours.
   - James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept.

   To find out how long James slept, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \text{James' Sleep Time} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times \text{Harry's Sleep Time}
   \]
   Substituting Harry's sleep time (9 hours):
   \[
   \text{James' Sleep Time} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine how many more hours Harry slept compared to James:**
   - Harry slept 9 hours.
   - James slept 6 hours.

   The difference in their sleep times can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's Sleep Time} - \text{James' Sleep Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.<|im_end|>","James slept 9 hours * 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 hours.
So, Harry slept 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 hours more than James.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of cans used:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce was 32 ounces.
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomato sauce.

   \[
   \text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total sauce}}{\text{Sauce per can}} = \frac{32}{16} = 2 \text{ cans}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tomatoes in one can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

   \[
   \text{Tomatoes per can} = 3 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

3. **Find the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda used 2 cans.

   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes} = (\text{Number of cans}) \times (\text{Tomatoes per can}) = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

4. **Verify the calculation using the given information about the loss:**
   - Canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Since the tomatoes lost half their volume, we need to double the amount to get back to the original volume.

   Let \( T \) be the initial number of tomatoes before cooking. Then:

   \[
   T \times 0.5 = 6 \implies T = \frac{6}{0.5} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda initially had 12 tomatoes. Therefore, after cooking them, she would have used 6 tomatoes (as calculated above).

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\) tomatoes.<|im_end|>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.

At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of cars that initially drove through the traffic jam**

- Initially, there are 30 cars.
- Out of these, 5 cars took an exit.

So, the number of cars that didn't leave the line is:
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time for which the cars remained on the motorway**

- The entire period for driving through the traffic jam is 30 minutes (since it's not specified otherwise).

**Step 3: Determine the number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes**

Since only 5 cars left after the initial 15 minutes, all other cars stayed in the jam for the full 30 minutes.

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through during the first 15 minutes is **5**.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 5.<|im_end|>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

   - She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   - Therefore, the total number of potted plants she has initially is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. **Calculate the number of potted plants Mary gives away:**
   - She decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges.
   - Therefore, the total number of potted plants she gives away is \(1 \times 40 = 40\).

3. **Subtract the given potted plants from the initial count:**
   - Subtracting the number of potted plants given away from the initial total gives us \(80 - 40 = 40\) potted plants remaining.

   - First friend: Pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   
   - Second friend: Pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend.
     Calculation:

To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day over the next four days, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Pages Read So Far
- **Science Textbook**: 4 pages
- **Social Studies Textbook**: 20 pages
- **History Textbook**: 7 pages
- **Geography Textbook**: 8 pages

Total pages read so far = \(4 + 20 + 7 + 8\)

\[= 43 \text{ pages}\]

### Step 2: Determine Remaining Pages to be Read
Solo has 4 more days left to finish his reading.

Total pages in all textbooks = \(4 + 20 + 7 + 8\)
\[= 43 \text{ pages}\]

Pages remaining to be read = Total pages - Pages already read

\[= 43 - 43\]

\[= 0 \text{ pages}\]

Since there are no pages remaining to be read after considering the 4 days left, it means Solo has finished reading all the required pages within those 4 days.

To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break down his drinking habits:

1. **Breakfast**: 1 glass of water per day.
2. **Lunch**: 1 glass of water per day.
3. **Dinner (weekday):** 1 glass of water per meal (3 meals/day = 3 glasses/day).
4. **Dinner (weekend)**: He has a soda instead of water.

Now, let's calculate the total for weekdays:
- Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner = 1glasses/meal * 3meals = 3 glasses/day
- Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total for weekdays is 3 glasses/day * 5 days = 15 glasses.

For the weekend:
- He doesn't have water at dinner, so no glasses of water.

Adding it all up:
- Weekdays: 15 glasses
- Weekend: 0 glasses

Total glasses of water in a week = 15 glasses + 0 glasses = 15 glasses.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire length of the city given its coverage rate.

Step 1: Understand the coverage rate.
- The fog bank covers 3 miles per 10 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance covered by the fog bank in 10 minutes.
- Since 3 miles are covered in 10 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find out how much of the city (in miles) would be covered in 10 minutes.

\[
\frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{x \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:

\[
x = \frac{3}{10} \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.

Step 3: Determine the number of intervals needed to cover the entire city.
- The city is 42 miles wide.
- Each interval that the fog bank covers is 3 miles long.

\[
\text{Number of intervals} = \frac{\text{Total width of the city}}{\text{Width covered per interval}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/interval}} = 14 \text{ intervals}
\]

Step 4: Calculate the time required to cover all these intervals.
- We know that covering one interval takes 10 minutes.

\[
\text{Time to cover } 14 \text{ intervals} = 14 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the whole city.

To determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed after Poppy and her mom have added their respective fractions of the pieces, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Poppy adds.
Poppy places a quarter (1/4) of the total pieces on the board.

- Total pieces = 1000
- Pieces Poppy adds = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 1000\)

\[
\text{Pieces Poppy adds} = \frac{1000}{4} = 250
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining pieces after Poppy has placed her share.
Subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces.

- Remaining pieces after Poppy = \(1000 - 250\)

\[
\text{Remaining pieces after Poppy} = 750
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces added by Poppy's mom.
Mom adds a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.

- Remaining pieces after Poppy = 750
- Pieces Mom adds = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 750\)

\[
\text{Pieces Mom adds} = \frac{750}{3} = 250
\]

### Step 4: Determine the remaining pieces after both Poppy and her mom have added their shares.
Subtract the number of pieces added by Poppy's mom from the remaining pieces after Poppy.

- Remaining pieces after both = \(750 - 250\)

\[
\text{Remaining pieces after both} = 500
\]

### Conclusion:
After both Poppy and her mom have placed their respective fractions of the pieces, there are 500 pieces left to be placed in the puzzle.

The final answer is {The final answer is}: 500<|im_end|>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Cody eats ? three times as many cookies as Amir.
   - Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Cody eats:**
   - Since Cody eats ? three times as many cookies as Amir, we can calculate Cody's cookie consumption using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Cody's Cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's Cookies}
     \]
   - Substitute the number of cookies Amir eats into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Cody's Cookies} = 3 \times 5
     \]

3. **Calculate the result:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Cody's Cookies} = 15
     \]

4. **Find the total number of cookies eaten by both:**
   - Add Cody's cookies to Amir's cookies:
     \[
     \text{Total Cookies} = \text{Cody's Cookies} + \text{Amir's Cookies}
     \]
   - Substitute the values obtained:
     \[
     \text{Total Cookies} = 15 + 5
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - Calculate the sum:
     \[
     \text{Total Cookies} = 20

                    question:
                    John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  What is the total inner ; volume of all 3 boxes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the outer dimensions of one box**
- Outer length (L_outer) = 5 inches + 2(1 inch) = 7 inches
- Outer width (W_outer) = 6 inches + 2(1 inch) = 8 inches
- Outer height (H_outer) = 4 inches + 2(1 inch) = 6 inches

**Step 2: Calculate the inner dimensions of one box**
- Inner length (L_inner) = L_outer - 2(inches) = 7 inches - 2(inches) = 5 inches
- Inner width (W_inner) = W_outer - 2(inches) = 8 inches - 2(inches) = 6 inches
- Inner height (H_inner) = H_outer - 2(inches) = 6 inches - 2(inches) = 4 inches

**Step 3: Calculate the volume of one box**
\[ \text{Volume} = L \times W \times H \]
\[ \text{Volume}_one = 5 \times 6 \times 4 \]

Let's perform this calculation:
\[ \text{Volume}_one = 5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cubic inches} \]

**Step 4: Multiply the volume of one box by the number of boxes**
\[ \text{Total Volume} = \text{Volume}_one \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 120 \times 3 = 360 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is \(360\) cubic inches.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{360}\).<|im_end|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                    question:
                    Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, : he watched a 1-hour episode ? of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down Frank's TV watching habits day-by-day and then sum up the total time spent watching TV.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent watching TV from Monday to Thursday**
- **Monday and Tuesday**: Each evening, Frank watched a 1-hour episode.
  - Total time = \(2 \times 1\text{ hour} = 2\text{ hours}\)
- **Wednesday**: Frank watched several episodes of a 30-minute show.
  - Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes as \(x\).
  - Time spent on Wednesday = \(30x\) minutes.
  - Convert minutes to hours (since 60 minutes make an hour): \(30x / 60 = x/2\) hours.
- **Thursday**: Frank watched a 1-hour episode followed by another 1-hour episode.
  - Total time = \(1 + 1 = 2\) hours.
- **Friday**: Frank watched two 1-hour episodes.
  - Total time = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now we know the total time Frank spent watching TV over these days is 7 hours. Therefore, the equation representing the total time is:

\[2\text{ hours} + x/2 + 2\text{ hours} + 2\text{ hours} = 7\text{ hours}\]

Simplify the left side:

\[6\text{ hours} + x/2 = 7\text{ hours}\]

Subtract 6 hours from both sides:

\[x/2 = 1\text{ hour}\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 2\]

So, Frank watched 2 episodes of a 30-minute show on Wednesday.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]<|im_end|>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many cookies Henry baked last year.
- Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
- According to the problem, Henry made twice as many cookies this time as last year, so he baked \( 2x \) cookies this time.

### Step 2: Set up an equation based on the information provided about the current situation.
- Henry baked 15 more cookies than intended, so he had \( (2x + 15) \) cookies.
- He dropped 5 cookies during cooling, leaving him with \( (2x + 15 - 5) = 2x + 10 \) cookies.

### Step 3: Solve the equation for \( x \).
We know that after dropping some, he ended up with 110 cookies in total. So we set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

### Conclusion:
Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]<|im_end|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total cost without any discounts.
2. Apply the cashback discount to find out how much cash back is earned from filling up.
3. Subtract the cash back from the total cost to determine the final amount paid.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost without any discounts.

- Cost per gallon = $3.00
- Number of gallons purchased = 10

Total cost (without discounts) = Cost per gallon × Number of gallons
= $3.00 × 10
= $30.00

Step 2: Apply the cashback discount.

- Cashback rate = $0.20 per gallon
- Number of gallons purchased = 10

Cashback amount = Cashback rate × Number of gallons
= $0.20 × 10
= $2.00

Step 3: Subtract the cash back from the total cost.

Final amount paid = Total cost - Cashback amount
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

                    Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, ; so they unroll , as many as they can find.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups in each person's batch.

#### Beatrice's Batch:
- Width: 2 roll-ups
- Length: 24 roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups

#### Marcell's Batch:
- Width: 3 roll-ups
- Length: 14 roll-ups
- Total roll-ups = Width * Length = 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups

### Step 2: Determine the difference between the batches.
Beatrice has more roll-ups than Marcell because her batch is wider but shorter.

### Step 3: Find out who eats fewer roll-ups per roll-up width.
Since Beatrice has 48 roll-ups and Marcell has 42 roll-ups, we need to compare them based on their roll-up widths.

- For Beatrice: (Width / Roll-ups per unit) = 2 / 48 = 0.042 rolls per roll-up
- For Marcell: (Width / Roll-ups per unit) = 3 / 42 = 0.071 rolls per roll-up

Marcell consumes roll-ups at a faster rate compared to Beatrice.

### Step 4: Determine how many roll-ups each person would consume if they had equal amounts.
We'll calculate the average consumption assuming both have eaten an equal number of roll-ups.

#### Average Consumption:
- Total roll-ups consumed by both: (Width + Length) / (Total roll-ups per unit)
- Since the total roll-ups per unit remains constant regardless of width or length, the average consumption will be the same for both if they have eaten an equal number of roll-ups.

Let's assume both have eaten the same number of roll-ups, say \( N \).

- Beatrice’s average consumption: \( \frac{N}{2} \)
- Marcell’s average consumption: \( \frac{N}{3} \)

### Step 5: Calculate the total roll-ups eaten by each.
- Beatrice’s total roll-ups: \( 2 \times \frac{N}{2} + 24 = N + 24 \)
- Marcell’s total roll-ups: \( 3 \times \frac{N}{3} + 14 = N + 14 \)

### Step 6: Find the average total roll-ups eaten by both.
- Average total roll-ups eaten: \( \frac{(N + 24) + (N + 14)}{2} = N + 19 \)

Therefore, they would eat on average:

\[
\boxed{N + 19}
\]

This means that if they both had eaten the same number of roll-ups, they would have eaten a combined total of \( N + 19 \).<|im_end|>","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the rate at which Julia rows:**
   - Julia takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Therefore, her speed (rate) is \( \frac{20}{16} = 1.25 \) feet per second.

2. **Calculate how long it will take her to reach the shore:**
   - The total distance from where she started to the shore is 64 seconds.
   - Using her rowing speed, we can find out how far she rows in 64 seconds: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \times 64 = 80 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine how many sections of 10 feet she has covered so far:**
   - She has already covered 20 feet, which is exactly one section of 10 feet.
   - So, she still needs to cover another 60 feet to reach the shore.

4. **Calculate the remaining time before reaching the shore:**
   - Since she has already spent 16 seconds and there are 64 seconds left until she reaches the shore,
   - She has \( 64 - 16 = 48 \) seconds left to row.

5. **Find out how many more sections of 10 feet she will cover in these 48 seconds:**
   - In 48 seconds, she will row \( \frac{48}{16} = 3 \) more sections of 10 feet.

6. **Calculate the amount of water that has been added after covering these additional sections:**
   - Each section adds 2 liters of water.
   - After 3 sections, she will have added \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) liters of water.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of Jamal's phone:**
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

2. **Calculate the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone holds 6 times more photographs than Brittany's.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, \( 6B = 1800 \).

3. **Solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
   So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

4. **Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Brittany's phone holds 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, \( 50R = 300 \).

5. **Solve for \( R \):**
   \[
   R = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

6. **Find the number of ducks at the zoo:**
   - The number of ducks at the zoo is equal to the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
   - Therefore, the number of ducks at the zoo is 6.

So, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine Sasha's profit from selling her lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lumber:**
   - Sasha buys 10 2x4x10 boards at $10 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 10 boards} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100
     \]
   - Sasha buys 5 4x4x10 boards at $16 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 5 boards} = 5 \times \$16 = \$80
     \]

   Adding both costs together gives us the total amount spent on buying the lumber.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber:**
   - Sasha sells the 10 2x4x10 boards at a price equal to their original cost plus a 50% increase due to the price hike.
     \[
     \text{Original price per board} = \$10
     \]
     \[
     \text{New price per board} = \$10 + (\$10 \times 0.5) = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
     \]
   - The total number of boards sold is \(10 + 5 = 15\).
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 15 \times \$15 = \$225
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$225 - \$180 = \$45
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100

                    question:
                    Katy : makes coffee using ; teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she ; used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls ! of sugar she used.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given ratio
Katy uses a ratio of sugar to water as 7:13.

### Step 2: Set up an equation based on the given information
Let \( S \) be the number of teaspoons of sugar used, and \( W \) be the number of cups of water used.

According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

This can be rewritten as:
\[ 13S = 7W \]

### Step 3: Express one variable in terms of the other
From the equation above, we can express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ W = \frac{13S}{7} \]

### Step 4: Use the total amount of sugar and water
We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water. So,
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Substitute \( W \) from Step 3 into this equation:
\[ S + \frac{13S}{7} = 120 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( S \)
Combine like terms:
\[ S \left(1 + \frac{13}{7}\right) = 120 \]
\[ S \left(\frac{7 + 13}{7}\right) = 120 \]
\[ S \left(\frac{20}{7}\right) = 120 \]

Divide both sides by \(\frac{20}{7}\):
\[ S = \frac{120 \times 7}{20} \]
\[ S = \frac{840}{20} \]
\[ S = 42 \]

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

2. **Calculate the total number of shoes John buys:**
   - Each pair of shoes contains 2 shoes.
   - Therefore, if John buys 2 pairs of shoes, he buys \(2 \times 2 = 4\) shoes in total.

3. **Find out the total cost of these shoes:**
   - The cost of each shoe is $60.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Count**:
   - On the first day, the customs officer counted 2! containers containing 5 vehicles each.

2. **Calculate Initial Total Vehicles**:
   - Number of vehicles per container = 5
   - Number of containers = 2!
   - Initial total number of vehicles = (Number of vehicles per container) * (Number of containers)
     \[
     \text{Initial total vehicles} = 5 \times 2! = 5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

3. **Given Final Total**:
   - After importing additional containers on the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30.

4. **Determine Additional Containers**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional containers added on the second day.
   - Each container still contains 5 vehicles.

5. **Calculate the New Total Number of Vehicles**:
   - New total number of vehicles = Initial total + Additional vehicles
     \[
     \text{New total vehicles} = 10 + x \times 5 = 30
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - We need to find \( x \) such that:
     \[
     10 + 5x = 30
     \]
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     5x = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     x = 4

                    question:
                    Adrien's total salary ! was ! 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was ! making four years ago.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Adrien's initial salary.
Adrien's initial salary (let's call it \( A \)) was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Given that Adrien's salary after increasing by 40% is $40,000, we can set up an equation to find \( A \).

First, let's express Adrien's salary after the increase in terms of his original salary:

\[ A + 0.3A = 40000 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 1.3A = 40000 \]

Now, solve for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{40000}{1.3} \]
\[ A = 30769.23 \approx \$30769.23 \]

So, Adrien's initial salary was approximately $30769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's new salary.
Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so we can write:

\[ A_{new} = A + 0.4A \]

Substituting the value of \( A \) from above:

\[ A_{new} = 30769.23 + 0.4 \times 30769.23 \]
\[ A_{new} = 30769.23 + 12307.70 \]
\[ A_{new} = 43076.93 \approx \$43076.93 \]

So, Adrien's new salary is approximately $43076.93.

### Step 3: Determine Lylah's initial salary.
Since Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously and Adrien's salary after the increase is $40,000, which represents 140% of Lylah's initial salary (since 40% increase on her salary equals $40,000), we can set up the following equation:

\[ Lylah's\ Salary + 0.4Lylah's\ Salary = 40000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 1.4Lylah's\ Salary = 40000 \]

Solving for Lylah's initial salary:

\[ Lylah's\ Salary = \frac{40000}{1.4} \]
\[ Lylah's\ Salary = 28571.43 \approx \$28571.43 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was approximately $28571.43.

### Step 4: Calculate Lylah's new salary.
Similarly, since Lylah's salary increased by 40%, her new salary would be:

\[ Lylah's\ Salary_{new} = Lylah's\ Salary + 0.4 \times Lylah's\ Salary \]

Substituting the value of Lylah's initial salary:

\[ Lylah's\ Salary_{new} = 28571.43 + 0.4 \times 28571.43 \]
\[ Lylah's\ Salary_{new} = 28571.43 + 11428.52 \]
\[ Lylah's\ Salary_{new} = 40000 \]

So, Lylah's new salary is also $40,000.

### Final Answer Calculation
Both Adrien and Lylah have the same new salary ($40,000). Therefore, their combined total salary is:

\[ Total\ Salary = Adrien's\ Salary + Lylah's\ Salary \]
\[ Total\ Salary = 40000 + 40000 \]
\[ Total\ Salary = 80000 \]

Thus, the total salary both Adrien and Lylah are receiving now is **$80,000**.<|im_end|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.
The total amount of salary the two earn four years later is $39200+$56000 = $<<39200+56000=95200>>95200

To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sheets used per week:**
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets.

   \[
   \text{Sheets per pad} = 30
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sheets per week} = \text{Pads per week} \times \text{Sheets per pad}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sheets per week} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of weeks in a month:**
   - There are typically 4 weeks in a month (assuming a standard calendar month).

   \[
   \text{Weeks per month} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sheets used per month:**
   - Multiply the number of sheets used per week by the number of weeks in a month.

   \[
   \text{Total sheets per month} = \text{Sheets per week} \times \text{Weeks per month}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sheets per month} = 60 \times 4 = 240

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the quantities of fruits each person brought:**
   - **Morisette**: 
     - Apples: 5
     - Oranges: 8
   - **Kael**:
     - Apples: Twice the amount of Morisette (i.e., \(2 \times 5 = 10\))
     - Oranges: Half the amount of Morisette (i.e., \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \))

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits for each person:**
   - **Morisette**:
     - Total fruits = Number of apples + Number of oranges = \(5 + 8 = 13\)
   - **Kael**:
     - Total fruits = Number of apples + Number of oranges = \(10 + 4 = 14\)

3. **Add up the total number of fruits from both Morisette and Kael**:
   - Combined total = Morisette's total + Kael's total = \(13 + 14 = 27\)

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first part where Rosie runs at her initial speed and the second part where she runs at her increased speed.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie covers in the first 3 hours.
- **Speed**: 10 miles per hour (mph)
- **Time**: 3 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time Rosie spends running after the first 3 hours.
- Total time available: 7 hours
- Time already spent: 3 hours

Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent

\[ \text{Remaining time} = 7 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining time.
- **Speed**: 5 miles per hour (mph)
- **Time**: Remaining time

Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Add the distances from both parts together.
Total Distance = Distance covered in the first 3 hours + Distance covered in the remaining time

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} \]

                    question:
                    Jennie is helping at her : mom's office. She has a pile of 60 : letters needing stamps, and a pile of . letters already ! stamped. She puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing . stamps. If , there ; are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, : how many were in : that pile when Jennie began?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of letters needing stamps.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of letters already stamped.

2. **Set up equations based on given information:**

   We know:
   - There are 60 letters needing stamps.
   - There are \( x = 60 \) letters needing stamps initially.
   - One-third of these letters get stamps (i.e., \( \frac{1}{3}x \)).
   - After adding stamps, 30 letters remain un-stamped.

3. **Calculate the number of letters already stamped after adding stamps:**

   According to the problem, 30 letters remain un-stamped out of the total 60 letters. This means:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters already stamped} = 60 - 30 = 30
   \]

4. **Verify the stamping process:**

   Since one-third of the letters needing stamps have been stamped, the number of letters already stamped should equal \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 \):
   \[
   \text{Number of letters already stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   
5. **Reconcile the discrepancy:**

   We see an inconsistency here because the calculation shows 30 letters being stamped instead of the expected 20. Let’s correct it.

   The correct equation for the number of letters already stamped should be:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters already stamped} = 60 - 30 = 30
   \]

   Revisiting the initial setup, if 30 letters are left un-stamped, then:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters already stamped} = 60 - 30 = 30
   \]

6. **Final Calculation:**

   Given that 30 letters are already stamped, and knowing that one-third of the letters needing stamps have been stamped:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of letters needing stamps initially was 60.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Spoons Available**:
   - Julia initially had no plastic spoons.

2. **Spoons Bought by Julia**:
   - Julia bought a new package of spoons.
   - Let's denote the number of spoons in the package as \( x \).

3. **Spoons Given by Husband**:
   - Julia's husband bought another package of 5 new spoons and gave these to her.
   - So, Julia now has \( x + 5 \) spoons.

4. **Spoons Used for Stew**:
   - Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
   - After using 3 spoons, she has \( (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2 \) spoons left.

5. **Spoons Left Before Setting the Table**:
   - When setting up the table, she had 12 spoons.
   - This means \( x + 2 = 12 \).

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - From \( x + 2 = 12 \), we can subtract 2 from both sides: 
     \[
     x = 12 - 2 \\
     x = 10
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item based on the given relationships and then calculate the total cost for Dillon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the cost of a pepper:**
   - Each pepper costs $15.
   - This information is already provided in the problem statement.

2. **Calculate the cost of a watermelon:**
   - The problem states that a watermelon costs ""three times what each pepper costs"".
     \[
     \text{Cost of one watermelon} = 3 \times (\text{Cost of one pepper}) = 3 \times \$15 = \$45
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of an orange:**
   - The problem states that an orange costs ""five dollars less than what a watermelon costs"".
     \[
     \text{Cost of one orange} = \text{Cost of one watermelon} - \$5 = \$45 - \$5 = \$40
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for Dillon:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.
   - Calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \$45 = \$180
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \$15 = \$300
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \$40 = \$400
     \]
   - Add up all these amounts to get the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \$180 + \$300 + \$400 = \$980
     \]

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to consider both revenue generated and expenses incurred. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue Generated
- **Number of patients per day**: 500
- **Average time spent on each visit (in hours)**: 24/60 = 0.4 hours
- **Charge per hour to the hospital**: $150/hour

First, let's calculate total revenue generated:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Average Time Per Patient} \times \text{Hourly Charge to Hospital} \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 500 \times 0.4 \times 150 \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 500 \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 30,000 \]

So, the total revenue generated by the hospital over the course of one day is $30,000.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Expenses Incurred
- **Charge per hour from patients**: $200/hour

Next, let's calculate total expenses:

\[ \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Hourly Charge from Patients} \]

\[ \text{Total Expenses} = 500 \times 200 \]

\[ \text{Total Expenses} = 100,000 \]

So, the total expenses incurred by the hospital over the course of one day are $100,000.

### Step 3: Calculate Profit
Finally, let's determine the hospital's profit by subtracting total expenses from total revenue:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Expenses} \]

\[ \text{Profit} = 30,000 - 100,000 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = -70,000 \]

Therefore, the hospital incurs a loss of $70,000 per day due to these visits.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The hospital makes a loss of $70,000 per day from these visits.<|im_end|>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day

They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

   - Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.

2. **Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them**:
   - A third of the elves quit.
   - Number of elves who quit = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60\).
   - \(60 \div 3 = 20\).

3. **Subtract those who quit due to vomiting from the total number of elves**:
   - Remaining elves = \(60 - 20\).
   - \(40\) elves remain.

4. **Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins**:
   - Ten more elves quit.
   - Total elves who have quit so far: \(20 + 10\).
   - \(30\) elves have quit.

5. **Subtract the total number of elves who have quit from the remaining elves**:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Joseph's total expenditure over the two months (May and June). We know that:

1. Joseph spent $500 in May.
2. His expenditure in June was $60 less than what he spent in May.

Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Joseph's expenditure in June
Since his expenditure in June was $60 less than what he spent in May, we can subtract $60 from the amount spent in May.

\[ \text{Expenditure in June} = \$500 - \$60 \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ \$500 - \$60 = \$440 \]

So, Joseph spent $440 in June.

### Step 2: Calculate the total expenditure over both months
Now, we add the expenditures from May and June together to find the total expenditure over the two months.

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \text{Expenditure in May} + \text{Expenditure in June} \]

Substitute the values we found:

\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \$500 + \$440 \]

Perform the addition:

\[ \$500 + \$440 = \$940 \]

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for the two months is $\boxed{\$940}$.<|im_end|>","His expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $<<500-60=440>>440.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of rides on the roller coaster:**
   - Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
   - Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
   - Together, they rode the roller coaster \( (2 + 4) = 6 \) times.

2. **Determine the cost for the roller coaster rides:**
   - Each ride costs 6 tickets.
   - For 6 rides, the total cost is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) tickets.

3. **Calculate the total number of rides on the luge:**
   - Pam and Fred each decide to ride the luge twice.
   - Therefore, together, they rode the luge \( (2 + 2) = 4 \) times.

4. **Determine the cost for the luge rides:**
   - Each ride costs 6 tickets.
   - For 4 rides, the total cost is \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) tickets.

5. **Sum up all the costs to find the total number of tickets used:**
   - The cost from the roller coaster is 36 tickets.
   - The cost from the luge is 24 tickets.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets used is \( 36 + 24 = 60 \).

### Conclusion:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the amount he walked on Monday.
\[ \text{Tuesday's miles} = 6 \times \text{Monday's miles} \]
\[ \text{Tuesday's miles} = 6 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Tuesday's miles} = 24 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday.
- Total miles from Monday to Tuesday:
\[ \text{Total from Monday to Tuesday} = \text{Monday's miles} + \text{Tuesday's miles} \]
\[ \text{Total from Monday to Tuesday} = 4 + 24 \]
\[ \text{Total from Monday to Tuesday} = 28 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday.
- The total mileage for Monday through Wednesday is given as 41 miles.
\[ \text{Wednesday's miles} = \text{Total from Monday to Tuesday} - \text{Total from Monday to Tuesday} \]

                    question:
                    Tom gets ; 4 car washes ! a ! month.  If each car wash ; costs $15 how much does he pay in a year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost per car wash
Tom spends $15 on each car wash.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of car washes in a year
Since Tom gets 4 car washes every month, we can calculate the total number of car washes in a year as follows:
\[ \text{Total car washes per year} = 4 \times 12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the annual cost for all car washes
Now that we know the total number of car washes in a year, we can find out the total amount Tom spends annually by multiplying this by the cost per car wash ($15):
\[ \text{Annual cost} = (\text{Total car washes per year}) \times (\$15) \]
\[ \text{Annual cost} = (4 \times 12) \times \$15 \]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
First, multiply the number of car washes by the months in a year:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Then, multiply the result by the cost per car wash:
\[ 48 \times \$15 = \$720 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$720}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step:

1. **Brian's Video Games**:
   - Initially, Brian has 20 video games.
   - He loses 5 video games, so his current number of video games is \(20 - 5 = 15\).

2. **Bobby's Video Games**:
   - According to the problem, Bobby has ""5 fewer"" than 3 times as many video games as Brian.

To find out how many video games Bobby has, we need to follow these steps:

- First, calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has: 
  \[
  3 \times 15 = 45
  \]

- Then, subtract 5 from this value (since Bobby has 5 fewer):
  \[
  45 - 5 = 40
  \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.

In conclusion, Bobby has **40 video games**.<|im_end|>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

2. **Calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns:**
   - We also know that two-thirds of the unicorns in Scotland are female.
   - Since we have determined that there are 9 unicorns in Scotland,

   Therefore,

Let's break down Rory's order and calculate the total cost step by step:

1. **Subs Cost:**
   - Rory orders 2 sub sandwiches.
   - Each sub costs $7.50.
   - Total cost for subs = \( 2 \times \$7.50 \) = \$15.

2. **Chip Bags Cost:**
   - Rory buys 2 bags of chips.
   - Each bag costs $1.50.
   - Total cost for chips = \( 2 \times \$1.50 \) = \$3.

3. **Cookies Cost:**
   - Rory buys 2 cookies.
   - Each cookie costs $1.00.
   - Total cost for cookies = \( 2 \times \$1.00 \) = \$2.

4. **Delivery Fee Calculation:**
   - The delivery fee is a 20% surcharge on the subtotal (which includes all items).
   - First, let's find the subtotal (all items before delivery fee):
     Subtotal = Subs + Chips + Cookies = \$15 + \$3 + \$2 = \$20.
   - Delivery fee = 20% of the subtotal.
     Delivery fee = \( 0.20 \times \$20 \) = \$4.

5. **Tip Calculation:**
   - Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.
   - Tip amount = \$5.

6. **Total Order Cost:**
   - Add the delivery fee and tip to the subtotal.
     Total = Subtotal + Delivery Fee + Tip
     Total = \$20 + \$4 + \$5 = \$39.

Therefore, the final cost of Rory's delivery order is \$39.<|im_end|>","2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in his first test.
Mark takes a test consisting of 75 questions.

- **Time taken for the first test**: 8 hours.
- **Rate of completing questions**: 5 questions per hour.

\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = 40 \]

So, Mark completes 40 questions out of the total 75 questions in the first test.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in his second test.
Mark takes a test consisting of 100 questions today.

- **Time available for the second test**: 6 hours.
- **Rate of completing questions**: 5 questions per hour.

\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = 5 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of questions Mark can complete} = 30 \]

So, Mark completes 30 questions out of the total 100 questions in the second test.

### Step 3: Determine the number of questions left incomplete in both tests.

#### First Test:
- Total questions: 75
- Completed questions: 40
- Incomplete questions: \( 75 - 40 \)

\[ \text{Incomplete questions (first test)} = 75 - 40 \]
\[ \text{Incomplete questions (first test)} = 35 \]

#### Second Test:
- Total questions: 100
- Completed questions: 30
- Incomplete questions: \( 100 - 30 \)

\[ \text{Incomplete questions (second test)} = 100 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Incomplete questions (second test)} = 70 \]

### Final Answer:
Mark leaves 35 questions incomplete in the first test and 70 questions incomplete in the second test. The final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.
Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs.

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we have:
\[ B = 12 \]

### Step 2: Establish the Relationship Between Pink and Blue Gumballs
According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs compared to the number of blue gumballs. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:
\[ P + 22 = 4B \]

Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P + 22 = 4 \times 12 \]
\[ P + 22 = 48 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( P \)
Now, solve for the number of pink gumballs (\( P \)):
\[ P + 22 = 48 \]
\[ P = 48 - 22 \]
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, there are **26** pink gumballs in total.

To determine the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of cars:**
   There are 20 cars in total.

2. **Determine the number of semi-automatic cars:**
   - We know there are 12 automatic cars.
   - There are 4 manual cars.
   
   Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars} + \text{Manual cars})
   \]
   Substituting the given numbers:
   \[
   \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars:**
   To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100\% = 0.2 \times 100\% = 20\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is \( \boxed{20\%} \).<|im_end|>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
   - Let \( Q \) represent the number of queen bees.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   - We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
     \[
     W = 2B
     \]

   - We also know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens:
     \[
     B = 2Q
     \]

3. **Express Baby Bees in Terms of Queens:**
   From the second equation, express \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
   \[
   B = 2Q
   \]

4. **Substitute into Worker Bee Equation:**
   Substitute \( B = 2Q \) into the first equation:
   \[
   W = 2(2Q)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   W = 4Q
   \]

5. **Use Total Number of Bees:**
   The total number of bees (bees plus queens) is 700:
   \[
   W + B + Q = 700
   \]

6. **Substitute Back Values:**
   Replace \( B \) and \( Q \) using their expressions from previous steps:
   \[
   W + 2Q + Q = 700
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   W + 3Q = 700
   \]

7. **Substitute for \( W \):**
   Use \( W = 4Q \) to substitute back:
   \[
   4Q + 3Q = 700
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   7Q = 700
   \]

8. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   Divide both sides by 7:
   \[
   Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
   \]

9. **Find \( B \) Using \( Q \):**
   Now find \( B \) using \( B = 2Q \):
   \[
   B = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

10. **Find \( W \) Using \( B \):**
    Finally, find \( W \) using \( W = 4Q \):
    \[
    W = 4 \times 100 = 400

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.
- Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day.
- There are 7 days in a week.

Total hours = (hours/day) × (days/week)
Total hours = 2 hours/day × 7 days/week
Total hours = 14 hours/week

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Jordan earns from his part-time job in one week.
- Jordan earns $10 per hour.
- Total hours worked = 14 hours/week.

Earnings = (earnings/hour) × (hours/worked)
Earnings = ($10/hour) × 14 hours/week
Earnings = $140/week

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Jordan would earn if he spent his video game time working.
- If he spent his video game time at work, his earnings would be solely from his part-time job since he's not earning anything else during that time.

Therefore, Jordan would earn the same amount as he does from his part-time job in one week.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Identify Non-Feathered Items
First, we need to identify which items are not food (non-food) based on their descriptions.

- Milk: Food
- Eggs: Food
- Light Bulbs: Not Food
- Cups: Not Food
- Roach Traps: Not Food

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost Before Tax
Next, we calculate the total cost of the non-food items before applying any taxes.

- Light Bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach Traps: $4

Total cost of non-food items = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10

### Step 3: Apply 10% Tax to Non-Food Items
Since there is a 10% tax on non-food items, we need to add 10% of $10 to the total cost of these items.

Tax amount = 10% of $10 = 0.1 * $10 = $1

So, the new total for the non-food items after tax = $10 + $1 = $11

### Step 4: Add Up All Costs
Now, let's sum up all costs including both food and non-food items.

Cost of Milk = $2
Cost of Eggs = $3
Cost of Light Bulbs = $3
Cost of Cups = $3
Cost of Racket Traps = $4

Total cost = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

To calculate Lucas's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Current clients: 3
   - Potential clients: 5
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles of bleach needed:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles.
   - Total bottles of bleach = 2 × 8 = 16

3. **Calculate the total cost for the bottles of bleach:**
   - Cost per bottle of bleach = $2
   - Total cost for bleach = 16 × $2 = $32

4. **Calculate the total number of packs of cloth needed:**
   - Each client needs 1 pack.
   - Total packs of cloth = 8 × 1 = 8

5. **Calculate the total cost for the packs of cloth:**
   - Cost per pack of cloth = $5
   - Total cost for cloth = 8 × $5 = $40

6. **Add up all expenses (bottles of bleach and packs of cloth):**
   - Total expenses = $32 (bleach) + $40 (cloth) = $72

7. **Subtract total expenses from total income:**
   - Total income per week = $92
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses = $92 - $72 = $20

**Final Answer:** Lucas will make a profit of $20 each week.<|im_end|>","Lucas counts a total of 3 confirmed clients + 5 potential clients = <<3+5=8>>8 clients.
Each week, he will need a total of 8 clients * 2 bottles of bleach per client = <<8*2=16>>16 bottles of bleach.
Each week, he will also need a total of 8 clients * 1 pack of cloths per client = <<8*1=8>>8 packs of cloths.
The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pineapples John can harvest in one month:**
   - John has 10 hectares.
   - There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

   First, calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare:
   \[
   10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many pineapples John can harvest in one month:**
   - John harvests once every 3 months.
   - Therefore, he harvests:
     \[
     \frac{1000 \text{ pineapples}}{3 \text{ months}} = \frac{1000}{3} \approx 333.33 \text{ pineapples/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, John will harvest:
     \[
     333.33 \text{ pineapples/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of Lego pieces in each box.
2. Sum the pieces from all boxes to find out how many pieces Johnny picked up.

Let's start with the first box: 
- The first box contains 500 pieces.

Next, let's consider the second box:
- This box has 3 times as many pieces as the first box.
- Therefore, the second box contains \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.

Finally, for the third box:
- It contains 1/4 (one-fourth) of the pieces in the first box.
- So, the third box contains \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Therefore, Johnny picks up **2125** Lego pieces in total.<|im_end|>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of bees entering and exiting the hive over time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
- **First 6 Hours**:
    - 30 bees leave the hive.

### Step 2: Return After Leaving
- **Next 6 Hours**:
    - Half the number of bees that initially left (30) return.
    - Number of returning bees = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

### Step 3: Additional Bees Leave
- **After the return period**:
    - Two times the number of bees that initially left (30) leave again.
    - Number of additional leaving bees = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).

### Step 4: Calculate Total Bees Leaving Over Time
- **Total bees leaving after the initial 6 hours**: 
    - First departure: 30 bees
    - Second departure: 60 bees
    - Total = \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) bees.

### Step 5: Calculate Number of Bees Returning
- **Number of bees returning after the second departure**:
    - Since half the number of bees that initially left return, and 30 bees initially left:
        - Number of returning bees = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

### Step 6: Calculate Final Bee Count Before Returning
- **Final count of bees remaining in the hive after all departures**:
    - Start with 30 bees.
    - Subtract those that leave: 30 bees.
    - Add those that return: 15 bees.
    - Final count = \( 30 - 30 + 15 = 15 \) bees remain in the hive.

### Step 7: Calculate Bees That Return in the Next 6 Hours
- **Bees returning in the next 6 hours**:
    - The same number of bees that left in the previous 6 hours will return.
    - Number of bees returning = \( 30 \).

### Conclusion
Debra sees a total of 30 bees return to the hive in the next 6 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount paid.
Brittany and her mom buy one child ticket and one adult ticket at the museum.

- Cost of an adult ticket = $12
- Cost of a child ticket = $10

Total cost of tickets:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$12 + \$10 = \$22 \]

Since they received $8 in change from their payment, we can determine how much they initially gave by adding the change to the total cost:
\[ \text{Initial Payment} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Change Received} \]
\[ \text{Initial Payment} = \$22 + \$8 = \$30 \]

So far, we have determined that Brittany and her mom gave the cashier a total of $30.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of children and adults they bought tickets for.
They bought one child ticket and one adult ticket.

### Step 3: Verify the calculation using the given information.
We know the total amount paid was $30, which includes both the tickets and the change. This confirms our initial calculation.

### Final Answer:
Brittany and her mom gave the cashier a total of **$30**.<|im_end|>","The total cost of the tickets is 12+10=<<12+10=22>>22 dollars.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has based on the information provided about Charlie's and Dorothy's numbers.

Step 1: Determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
- We know that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Therefore, if \( C \) represents Charlie’s friends and \( D \) represents Dorothy’s friends, then \( C = 3D \).
- Given \( C = 12 \), we can substitute this into the equation: \( 12 = 3D \).

Step 2: Solve for Dorothy's Facebook friends.
- To find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has, divide both sides by 3: 
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
- This simplifies to:
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Step 3: Determine the number of Facebook friends James has.
- We know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Since Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, James will have:
\[ J = 4 \times D \]

Step 4: Substitute Dorothy's number of friends into the equation for James' friends.
- Substituting \( D = 4 \):
\[ J = 4 \times 4 \]
- Simplify this:
\[ J = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\).<|im_end|>","Dorothy has 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 Facebook friends.

To determine who wins the race and for how long they wait or lose, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time it takes for Steve to complete the race:**
   - Distance: 3 miles = 18,200 feet (since 1 mile = 5,280 feet)
   - Speed: 440 feet per minute
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{18,200 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 41.57 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes for Tim to complete the race:**
   - Distance: 2 miles = 9,360 feet (since 1 mile = 5,280 feet)
   - Speed: 264 feet per minute
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{9,360 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = 35.29 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Compare the times to determine who wins:**
   - Steve's time: 41.57 minutes
   - Tim's time: 35.29 minutes
   Since 35.29 < 41.57, Tim completes the race faster.

4. **Determine who waits longer:**
   - The winner (Tim) will be waiting.
   - The loser (Steve) will finish first.

5. **Calculate the difference in time between the two:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 41.57 \text{ minutes} - 35.29 \text{ minutes} = 6.28 \text{ minutes}
   \]

**Conclusion:**

- The winner (Tim) will take 35.29 minutes to complete the race.
- The winner (Tim) will be waiting for 6.28 minutes before the loser (Steve) finishes the race.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of tires inflated:**
   - For bicycles (each has 2 tires): \(5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}\)
   - For tricycles (each has 3 tires): \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}\)
   - For unicycles (each has 1 tire): \(1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}\)

2. **Calculate the total cost for inflating these tires:**
   - Cost per tire: $0.25
   - Total cost for bikes: \(10 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} = \$2.50\)
   - Total cost for tricycles: \(9 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} = \$2.25\)
   - Total cost for unicycles: \(1 \text{ tire} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} = \$0.25\)

3. **Sum up the total revenue:**
   - Revenue from bikes: \$2.50
   - Revenue from tricycles: \$2.25
   - Revenue from unicycles: \$0.25
   - Total revenue: \$2.50 + \$2.25 + \$0.25 = \$5.00

4. **Determine how much money Shawnda made:**
   - Shawnda decided to charge by the tire.
   - Since each tire costs $0.25, we can calculate the total amount Shawnda charged as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total amount charged} = \text{Number of tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire}
     \]
     Substituting in our numbers:
     \[
     \text{Total amount charged} = 10 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} + 9 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} + 1 \text{ tire} \times \$0.25/\text{tire}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Total amount charged} = \$2.50 + \$2.25 + \$0.25 = \$5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $5.00 that day. The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$ Dollars.<|im_end|>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.

                    question:
                    Dave bought a large pack of french : fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the , seagull landed, he ? gobbled down half the amount of french fries that : Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about what happened after Dave lost the pack.

1. **Final number of fries left**: 5 fries.
2. **Raccoon's share**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the fries. Since there are 5 fries left after the raccoon took some, let \( x \) be the total number of fries initially. So, \( \frac{2}{3}x = (x - 5) \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \).

Let's calculate how many fries remained before the raccoon arrived:

\[ x - \frac{2}{3}x = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 5 \]
\[ x = 15 \]

So, the pack contained 15 fries at first.

3. **Seagull's share**: The seagull ate half as much as Dave did before the seagull arrived. Let's denote the number of fries Dave ate as \( d \). So, the seagull ate \( \frac{d}{2} \).

Since Dave ate 14 fries, we have:

\[ \frac{d}{2} = 7 \]
\[ d = 14 \]

Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole them.

4. **Fries eaten by the seagull**: After eating 7 fries, the seagull was left with \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) fries.

5. **Pigeons' share**: Three pigeons ate three fries each, so they collectively ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries. This means the number of fries left after the pigeons ate is \( 7 - 9 = -2 \), which indicates an error since the number of fries cannot be negative. However, if we correct our understanding, the pigeons might have taken all but one or more fries, not necessarily three per pigeon.

6. **Remaining fries after pigeons**: If the pigeons took all but one or more fries, then the pack originally had enough fries such that even after the seagull ate half of Dave's portion, plus the pigeons taking all but one or more fries, there were still 5 fries left.

7. **Calculating initial fries**:
   - Dave eats 14 fries.
   - Seagull takes half of Dave's fries: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \).
   - Remaining fries after seagull: \( 14 - 7 = 7 \).
   - Pigeons take all but one or more fries, leaving 5 fries.

Therefore, the pack originally had \( 14 + 7 + 5 = 26 \) fries.

**The final answer is:** 26<|im_end|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours per week.
2. Multiply that by the number of weeks in a semester.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of class hours per week**

Kimo has different types of classes on different days:

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays**: He attends 3 classes (each 1 hour long) every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
  
    - Number of classes per day = 3
    - Length of each class = 1 hour
    
    Total for those three days = \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours/day

- **Tuesdays and Thursdays**: He attends 2 classes (each 2 hours long) every Tuesday and Thursday.
  
    - Number of classes per day = 2
    - Length of each class = 2 hours
    
    Total for those two days = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours/day

So, the total number of class hours per week is:
\[3 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of class hours for the entire semester**

There are 16 weeks in the semester, so:
\[7 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 112 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, in one semester, Kimo spends a total of 112 hours attending classes.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {112}.<|im_end|>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.

                    question:
                    Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 ? baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette : is two feet long. If Bill puts all ! the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total length of all the baked goods if put end-to-end, we need to calculate the lengths for each type of baked good and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the length of the rolls:**
   - Number of rolls = 300
   - Length per roll = 4 inches
   - Total length of rolls = \( 300 \times 4 \) inches

\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
\]

2. **Calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:**
   - Number of croissants = 120
   - Length per croissant = 6 inches
   - Total length of croissants = \( 120 \times 6 \) inches

\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

3. **Calculate the length of the baguettes:**
   - Number of baguettes = 60 (we don't know this number)
   - Length per baguette = 2 feet (since each baguette is two feet long)

First, convert the length of one baguette from feet to inches:
\[
1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
\]
So,
\[
2 \text{ feet} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, calculate the total length of the baguettes:
\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

### Summing Up All Lengths:

\[
\text{Total length} = \text{Length of rolls} + \text{Length of croissants} + \text{Length of baguettes}
\]

Substitute the calculated values into the equation:

\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

\[
\text{Total length} = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

Convert the total length back to feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[
\text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}}
\]

\[
\text{Total length in feet} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}

Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet
Then find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet

                    The zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. ? If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas ; every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order over two months, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total banana requirements per month.
- Monkeys require 200 bananas.
- Gorillas require 400 bananas.
- Baboons require 100 bananas.

First, add up the total number of bananas needed per month:

\[ \text{Total monthly requirement} = 200 (\text{monkeys}) + 400 (\text{gorillas}) + 100 (\text{baboons}) \]

\[ \text{Total monthly requirement} = 700 \]

So, the zookeeper needs **700 bananas** per month.

### Step 2: Determine how many months pass between orders.
The zookeeper places an order every 2 months.

### Step 3: Calculate total orders needed over 2 months.
Since there are 2 months and the zookeeper places one order every 2 months, they will place exactly **1 order** over this period.

### Step 4: Calculate total banana requirements for 1 order.
Each order provides 700 bananas (as calculated earlier).

### Step 5: Compute the total number of bananas ordered over 2 months.
Multiply the number of bananas per order by the number of orders placed over 2 months:

\[ \text{Total bananas ordered over 2 months} = 700 (\text{bananas per order}) \times 1 (\text{order}) \]

\[ \text{Total bananas ordered over 2 months} = 700 \]

### Final Answer:
\[

To determine how far the winner runs more than the loser, we need to calculate the distances each person covers.

**Step 1: Calculate Blake's distance**

Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- Each round trip (back and forth) is \(2 \times 100\) yards = \(200\) yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 200\) yards.

\[
\text{Distance Blake runs} = 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Kelly's distance**

Kelly runs back and forth twice initially (\(2 \times 100\) yards for each round trip).
- Then she runs from the 40-yard line to the 80-yard line and back, which is \(2 \times 40\) yards = \(80\) yards per leg.
- Since she does this 34 times, her total distance covered is:

\[
\text{Distance Kelly runs} = 2 \times 100 + 34 \times (2 \times 40)
\]

\[
= 200 + 34 \times 80
\]

\[
= 200 + 2720
\]

\[
= 2920 \text{ yards}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the distances**

Blake runs \(3000\) yards, while Kelly runs \(2920\) yards.

**Step 4: Determine the difference**

The difference in distance between the winners is:

\[
3000 - 2920 = 80 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, **the winner runs \(80\) yards farther than the loser**.<|im_end|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

**Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish caught by Locsin**
- Anakin caught 10 starfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin.
\[ \text{Number of starfish caught by Locsin} = 10 - 5 = 5 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses caught by Locsin**
- Anakin caught 6 sea horses.
- Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin.
\[ \text{Number of sea horses caught by Locsin} = 6 - 3 = 3 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish caught by Locsin**
- Anakin caught 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin.
\[ \text{Number of clownfish caught by Locsin} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

**Step 4: Sum up all the catches**
- Starfish caught by Anakin: 10
- Sea horses caught by Anakin: 6
- Clownfish caught by Anakin: 3
- Starfish caught by Locsin: 5
- Sea horses caught by Locsin: 3
- Clownfish caught by Locsin: 5

Now, let's add them together:

\[ 10 (starfish) + 6 (sea_horses) + 3 (clownfish) + 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea_horses) + 5 (clownfish) = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is **30**.<|im_end|>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.

They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

                    question:
                    If a bag of marbles costs $20 and , the price increases by 20% of the original ? price every two ; months, how much : would a bag of marbles . cost after 36 months?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months given that it initially costs $20 and its price increases by 20% every two months, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% every two months.

3. **Calculate the Number of Price Increases in 36 Months**:
   - Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many times this happens in 36 months.
   - Number of two-month periods = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

4. **Determine the Final Price**:
   - Each increase multiplies the current price by 1.2 (since 20% increase means multiplying by 1.2).
   - After 18 such increases, the total multiplier will be \( 1.2^{18} \).

5. **Compute the Total Multiplier**:
   - Calculate \( 1.2^{18} \):
     \[
     1.2^2 = 1.44 \\
     1.2^3 = 1.44 \times 1.2 = 1.728 \\
     1.2^4 = 1.728 \times 1.2 = 2.0736 \\
     ...
     \]
     Continuing this process up to \( 1.2^{18} \) involves more complex calculations but using logarithms or a calculator gives approximately:
     \[
     1.2^{18} \approx 952.68
     \]

6. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - Multiply the initial cost by the total multiplier:
     \[
     \text{Final Cost} = 20 \times 952.68 = 19053.6
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - There is 1 doll.
   - A doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car.
   - One red car costs $4.

2. **Determine the value of one action figure:**
   Since a doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car costs $4, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Value of one doll} = 3 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + \text{Value of one red car}
   \]
   Given that the value of one red car is $4, substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Value of one doll} = 3 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + 4
   \]

3. **Express the total value in terms of the doll’s value:**
   Let \( D \) represent the total value of the dolls. We know that a doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car. Therefore, the total value of the dolls is:
   \[
   D = \text{Value of one doll} + \text{Value of one action figure} + \text{Value of one red car}
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   D = (3 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + 4) + (\text{Value of one action figure}) + 4
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression for the total value of the dolls:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   D = 3 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + \text{Value of one action figure} + 8
   \]
   Factor out the common term:
   \[
   D = 4 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the value of one action figure:**
   From the previous steps, we have:
   \[
   \text{Value of one action figure} = \frac{\text{Total Value}}{4} - 2
   \]
   Substitute back to find the total value:
   \[
   D = 4 \times \left(\frac{\text{Total Value}}{4} - 2\right) + 8
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   D = 4 \times \left(\frac{\text{Total Value}}{4} - 2\right) + 8 = \text{Total Value} - 8 + 8 = \text{Total Value}
   \]

6. **Find the total value of the toys:**
   The total value of the toys is the sum of the values of the dolls and the action figures:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = \text{Value of one doll} + \text{Value of one action figure} + \text{Value of one red car}
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = \left(3 \times (\text{Value of one action figure}) + 4\right) + \text{Value of one action figure} + 4
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = 4 \times (\text{Value of one action figure})
   \]

7. **Substitute the value of one action figure back:**
   Recall from step 5 that:
   \[
   \text{Value of one action figure} = \frac{\text{Total Value}}{4} - 2
   \]
   Substitute this into the total value:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = 4 \times \left(\frac{\text{Total Value}}{4} - 2\right)
   \]
   Distribute the 4:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = \text{Total Value} - 8
   \]
   Solve for \(\text{Total Value}\):
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is $\boxed{8}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.

To determine how much more money Jackie would have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total lost income from not being able to do freelance work:**
   - Jackie can't work on freelance projects for 3 hours.
   - She earns $35 per hour freelancing.

\[
\text{Total lost income} = \text{Number of hours lost} \times \text{Hourly rate}
\]

\[
\text{Total lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
\]

2. **Determine the cost of hiring an accountant:**

   Jackie's accountant charges $90.

3. **Compare the lost income with the cost of hiring the accountant:**

   Subtract the accountant's fee from the total lost income.

\[
\text{Additional money Jackie has} = \text{Total lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee}
\]

\[
\text{Additional money Jackie has} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15
\]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Elvira will have left after purchasing the computer and its accessories. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Cost of Computer Accessories
Elvira buys several items from the computer store:

- Screen, Keyboard, Mouse (€1090)
- Scanner (€157)
- CD Burner (€74)
- Printer (€102)

First, let's add up these costs:

\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1423 \text{ euros}
\]

So, the total cost of the computer and its accessories is **€1423**.

### Step 2: Subtract the Total Cost from Her Budget
Elvira's budget is €1500. We subtract the total cost of the computer and its accessories from her budget:

\[
1500 - 1423 = 77 \text{ euros}
\]

Therefore, after making her purchases, Elvira will have **€77** left in her budget.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine Seth's current age based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.
Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

From the problem statement:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \)

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement
The problem states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ S + B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ S + B = 24 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

### Step 4: Substitute and Solve for One Variable
We can substitute \( S = 2B \) into the second equation:
\[ 2B + B = 24 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

### Step 5: Find Seth's Age
Since \( S = 2B \):
\[ S = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ S = 16 \]

### Conclusion
Seth is currently **16** years old.

{The final answer is} The final answer is 16.<|im_end|>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.

And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

Step 1: Determine how much Pancho walks during weekdays.
- There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
- He walks 20 miles per day on these days.
  
\[ \text{Total distance on weekdays} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total distance on weekdays} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Step 2: Determine how much Pancho walks during weekends.
- On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles per day.

\[ \text{Total distance on weekends} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total distance on weekends} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Step 3: Add the distances from weekdays and weekends together to get the total distance for a week.

\[ \text{Total distance in a week} = \text{Total distance on weekdays} + \text{Total distance on weekends} \]

\[ \text{Total distance in a week} = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs from the spiders, insects, and rare mutant invertebrates separately, then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs from the spiders.
- Number of spiders = 80
- Legs per spider = 8
- Total legs from spiders = Number of spiders × Legs per spider
\[ \text{Total legs from spiders} = 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of legs from the insects.
- Number of insects = 90
- Legs per insect = 6
- Total legs from insects = Number of insects × Legs per insect
\[ \text{Total legs from insects} = 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates.
- Number of rare mutant invertebrates = 3
- Legs per rare mutant invertebrate = 10
- Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = Number of rare mutant invertebrates × Legs per rare mutant invertebrate
\[ \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all the legs.
\[ \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from spiders} + \text{Total legs from insects} + \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates} \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

Therefore, Jake sees a total of **1210 legs**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of spider legs: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = <<80*8=640>>640 legs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Sally's Age**:
   - We know that Sally is 8 years old.
   - Sally is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   - Therefore, SallyThirtytwo = 8.

2. **Calculate Granny's Age**:
   - GrannyRed is twice as old as SallyFour (which we also know to be 4).
   - GrannyRed = 2 * SallyFour.
   - Since SallyFour = 4, GrannyRed = 2 * 4 = 8.

3. **Calculate Red's Age**:
   - Red is three years older than SallyTwo (who is not explicitly mentioned but implied to be SallyFour).
   - Let's denote Red's age as R.
   - Given that SallyTwo = SallyFour = 4, then Red = SallyTwo + 3.
   - Red = 4 + 3 = 7.

4. **Calculate Caboose's Age**:
   - The total number of birds is four.
   - So, the sum of their ages should equal the total age of all four birds.
   - Let's denote the Caboose's age as C.
   - We have: C + GrannyRed + Red + SallyFour = Total Age of All Birds.
   - Substituting known values: C + 8 + 7 + 4 = Total Age of All Birds.
   - Simplifying: C + 25 = Total Age of All Birds.

5. **Summarize the Ages**:
   - We need to find the total age of all four birds, which is represented by the equation above.
   - From the information given, we can calculate this directly using the provided data.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - To find the total age of the four birds, we add up their individual ages.
   - TotalAge = GrannyRed + Red + SallyFour + Caboose'sAge.
   - TotalAge = 8 + 7 + 4 + C.
   - Since we don't have the value for C, we cannot determine the exact numerical total without more information about the age of the fourth bird (the Caboose).

Given the steps, we've determined the ages of Sally, GrannyRed, Red, and SallyFour. However, we haven't calculated the age of the fourth bird (Caboose) because it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the total age of the four birds would be:
\[ \text{Total Age} = 8 + 7 + 4 + C \]
where \(C\) is the age of the fourth bird (Caboose). Without knowing \(C\), we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. 

However, if we assume that the ""fourth"" bird is the one we're interested in finding, then the total age of the birds could potentially be different depending on its age. But since no additional information was provided about the age of the fourth bird, we must conclude that we do not have enough information to determine the exact total age of all four birds. 

So, the final answer is: 
\[ \boxed{\text{Not enough information}} \]<|im_end|>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.

Sally Thirtytwo, Sally four, and Sally red are 16+16 = <<32=32>>32 years old.
Sally two is three years older than Granny red, meaning Sally two is 16+3= <<16+3=19>>19 years old.
The four birds have a total age of 32+19 = <<32+19=51>>51 years old.

To determine how much Jessica should pay each month for her debts at 50% above the minimum amount, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total monthly cost based on the minimum payments:**
   - Student loans: $300/month
   - Credit card: $200/month
   - Mortgage: $500/month
   
   Total monthly cost = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

2. **Determine the increased amount (50% over the total):**
   Increase = 50% of $1000 = 0.5 × $1000 = $500
  
3. **Add this increase to the original total to find the new monthly cost:**
   New monthly cost = Original total + Increase = $1000 + $500 = $1500/month

4. **Calculate the yearly cost by multiplying the new monthly cost by 12 months/year:**
   Yearly cost = New monthly cost × 12 = $1500/month × 12 = $18000/year

Therefore, Jessica should pay $18000 per year if she pays 50% more than the minimum.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time Billy spends on both peeling and cutting the potatoes. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the total time spent peeling:**
   - Time per potato = 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds)
   - Number of potatoes = 60
   - Total time for peeling = \(60 \times 90\) seconds

2. **Calculate the total time spent cutting:**
   - Time per potato = 5 seconds
   - Number of potatoes = 60
   - Total time for cutting = \(60 \times 5\) seconds

3. **Sum the times from peeling and cutting:**
   - Total time spent = Time for peeling + Time for cutting

Let's do these calculations:

1. **Total time for peeling:**
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 90 \text{ seconds/potato} = 5400 \text{ seconds} \]

2. **Total time for cutting:**
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 5 \text{ seconds/potato} = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

3. **Total time spent:**
\[ 5400 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 300 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the total time into minutes:
\[ \frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes is \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}}.<|im_end|>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.

So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total revenue:**
   - They sell 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Each glass sells for $0.50.
   
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times 0.50 = \$10
\]

2. **Determine total cost:**
   - We know their profit is $25.

Since profit equals total revenue minus total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}
\]

We can rearrange this equation to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Profit}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 - 25 = -\$15
\]

This negative value indicates that there was an overcharge; hence, they spent more than what they earned. However, let's proceed assuming they sold exactly 20 glasses at $0.50 each, as stated.

3. **Calculate total variable costs (costs related to production):**
   - Costs include lemons and sugar.
   - For one gallon, the cost of lemons is $3 and the cost of sugar is $2.
   
\[
\text{Variable Cost Per Gallon} = 3 + 2 = \$5
\]

4. **Calculate total number of gallons produced:**
   - Profit is $25.
   - Since they have a fixed price per glass ($0.50) and sell 20 glasses per gallon,
   
\[
\text{Number Of Gallons} = \frac{\$25}{\$0.50} = 50 \text{ gallons}
\]

5. **Calculate total variable cost:**
   - Total variable cost is the sum of the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons.

\[
\text{Total Variable Cost} = 50 \times 5 = \$250
\]

6. **Calculate total spending on lemons:**
   - From the total variable cost, we subtract the fixed cost of sugar since only lemons' cost needs calculation.

\[
\text{Total Spending On Lemons} = \$250 - (\text{Total Fixed Cost of Sugar})
\]

However, since the problem does not provide information about the amount of sugar used or its fixed cost, we cannot determine the exact amount spent on lemons without additional data.

**Conclusion:** Given the current information, we cannot accurately determine the amount spent on lemons because the fixed cost of sugar is unknown. Therefore, the final answer based on the provided data is:

\boxed{-\$15}

4. **Identify the number of boys on the Chinese team:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Calculate Zaid's total monthly income**
Zaid earns $6000 per month.

**Step 2: Determine how much Zaid spends on rent**
Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
\[ \text{Rent cost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \]

**Step 3: Determine how much Zaid spends on car fuel and fuel-related expenses**
Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
\[ \text{Car fuel cost} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel**
\[ \text{Total spent on rent and car fuel} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \]

**Step 5: Subtract the rent and car fuel costs from his total earnings**
\[ \text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \]

**Step 6: Determine how much Zaid donates to charity**
Zaid donates half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2500 - 3500) = \frac{1}{2} \times (-1000) = -500 \]
Since it doesn't make sense for him to donate a negative amount, let's correct our calculation:
\[ \text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2500 - 3500) = \frac{1}{2} \times (-1000) = -500 \]
This indicates an error in the logic or data provided; however, proceeding as if the donation was hypothetically calculated correctly for further steps would be incorrect based on the given information.

**Step 7: Correctly calculate the donation to charity**
Let's assume there was no mistake in the donation logic but in the calculation of remaining funds. The donation would then be zero since he only donates half of the remaining after rent and car fuel, which is effectively zero given the amounts involved.

**Step 8: Determine how much money remains after giving to charity**
\[ \text{Money left after donating} = 2500 - 500 = 2000 \]

**Step 9: Calculate the remaining after spending on his daughter and wife’s expenses**
Zaid has given $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife.
\[ \text{Remaining after giving to daughter and wife} = 2000 - 900 = 1100 \]

Therefore, **after all these expenses and donations**, Zaid will have **$1100** left.<|im_end|>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has based on the information provided and then find the total number of crabs they all have together.

1. **Determine Monica's crab count:**
   - We know that Bo has 40 crabs.
   - The problem states ""Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.""
   - Therefore, if Bo has 40 crabs, then Monica must have \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.

2. **Determine Rani's crab count:**
   - The problem states ""Rani has ten more crabs than Monica.""
   - Since Monica has 36 crabs, Rani will have \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

3. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**
   - Now we add up the numbers of crabs for all three individuals.
     - Bo: 40 crabs
     - Monica: 36 crabs
     - Rani: 46 crabs
   - Adding these together gives us \(40 + 36 + 46\).

To determine how much Lloyd earned over the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from the first week**

- Number of hours worked in the first week = 5 hours
- Earnings per hour = $10

\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Earnings per hour} \]

\[
= 5 \times 10 = \$50
\]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from the second week**

- Number of hours worked in the second week = 8 hours
- Earnings per hour = $10

\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Earnings per hour} \]

\[
= 8 \times 10 = \$80
\]

**Step 3: Add up earnings from both weeks**

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from the first week} + \text{Earnings from the second week} \]

\[
= 50 + 80 = \$130
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total amount Lloyd earned over the first two weeks is **$130**.<|im_end|>","Lloyd tutored 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 hours for the first two weeks.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many votes the winner and loser received based on the given information.

1. **Determine the total number of votes cast:**
   - The total number of students who voted is given as 80.

2. **Calculate the votes for the winner:**
   - The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes.
   - To find out how many votes the winner got, we multiply the total number of votes (80) by \(\frac{3}{4}\).

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4}
\]

\[
= 80 \times 0.75
\]

\[
= 60
\]

So, the winner received 60 votes.

3. **Calculate the votes for the loser:**
   - Since the total number of votes is 80 and the winner received 60 votes, the remaining votes must be for the loser.
   - Subtract the votes of the winner from the total votes:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
\]

\[
= 20

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Identify the total number of flowers ordered:**
   - Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of white carnations.
   - According to the problem, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).

2. **Determine the number of pink calla lilies:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies.
   - The number of pink calla lilies is 5 times the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, \( 5W = 200 \).
   
3. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - From \( 5W = 200 \), we can find \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   So, there are 40 white carnations.

4. **Calculate the number of red roses:**
   - Since the number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations, we have:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

5. **Verify the total number of flowers ordered:**
   - Total number of flowers:
     \[
     \text{White carnations (W)} + \text{Red roses (4W)} + \text{Pink calla lilies (200)} = 40 + 160 + 200 = 400
     \]

Since the total matches our earlier calculations, we can conclude that Sandra ordered a total of 400 flowers.

**Final Answer:** Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business from switching suppliers.<|im_end|>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. **Jean** is two years older than **Mark**.
2. Two years ago, **Mark** was 5 years older than half of **Jan's** age.

Given that **Jan** is 30 years old, we can proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Determine Mark's current age
- Since **Jan** is 30 years old now, half of **Jan's** age is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) years.
- Two years ago, **Mark** was 5 years older than half of **Jan's** age, so two years ago, he was \( 15 + 5 = 20 \) years old.
- Therefore, Mark is currently \( 20 + 2 = 22 \) years old.

### Step 2: Determine Jean's age based on Mark's age
- We know that **Jean** is two years older than **Mark**.
- So, if Mark is 22 years old, then Jean is \( 22 + 2 = 24 \) years old.

Therefore, Jean is 24 years old. The final answer is:

To determine how much longer it takes for the slower team to complete its entire race compared to the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by both teams.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Total Time for the Faster Team:**
   - The faster team consists of four runners.
   - Each member runs their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds.
   - Therefore, the total time for the faster team is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total time (Faster Team)} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time (Faster Team)} = 220 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Time for the Slower Team:**
   - The slower team's first runner completes their 400 meters in 60 seconds.
   - Each subsequent runner runs at a speed that is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.
   - Let's denote the time taken by the \(n\)-th runner as \(T_n\) where \(n\) ranges from 1 to 4.
   
   For simplicity, let's assume the times are:
   - First runner: 60 seconds
   - Second runner: \(60 + 3 = 63\) seconds
   - Third runner: \(63 + 3 = 66\) seconds
   - Fourth runner: \(66 + 3 = 69\) seconds
   
   Now, we can sum these up:
   \[
   \text{Total time (Slower Team)} = 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time (Slower Team)} = 258 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Determine the Difference in Time:**
   To find out how much longer the faster team wins, subtract the total time of the slower team from the total time of the faster team:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total time (Faster Team)} - \text{Total time (Slower Team)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 220 \text{ seconds} - 258 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = -38 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the faster team actually finishes earlier than the slower team. 

Therefore, the faster team wins by 38 seconds.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities for both scenarios and then find the difference between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3:**
   - A standard six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6.
   - The outcomes greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

2. **Determine the probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row:**
   - An even number on a die can be either 2 or 4.
   - The total number of ways to roll two dice is \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \).
   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes where both numbers are even.
   - The pairs are: (2, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 4). So there are 4 such outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{two even numbers}) \) is:
     \[
     P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{\text{Number of successful outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9}
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in likelihoods:**
   - To find how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
   - Let \( x \) represent the percentage increase over rolling two even numbers.
   - Then,
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{9} = x \cdot \left( \frac{1}{9} \right)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{9} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{9}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{8}{9}\right) = \frac{4}{9}
     \]
     Converting this fraction to a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.4444 \approx 44.44\%
     \]

Therefore, it is approximately **44.44%** more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than it is that he rolls two even numbers in a row. 

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44.44\%}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of straw.
We know that 160 pieces of straw were distributed in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of straw per rodent.
- Rats: Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- Hamsters: Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- Rabbits: Each rabbit gets 20 pieces of straw.

Let \( r \) be the number of rats, \( h \) be the number of hamsters, and \( b \) be the number of rabbits.

From the information given:
\[ 6r + 5h + 20b = 160 \]

### Step 3: Express the number of hamsters and rabbits in terms of \( r \).
Since there are 10 cages for hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, we can write:
\[ h = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \]

Similarly, since there are 10 cages for rabbits and each rabbit gets 20 pieces of straw, we can write:
\[ b = \frac{10}{20} = 0.5 \]
However, since the number of animals must be an integer, we need to adjust our approach. Let's consider if the distribution was meant to be whole numbers. Given the context, we should assume the distribution was intended to be such that all quantities (rats, hamsters, rabbits) are integers.

Given the constraints, let's re-evaluate the distribution without fractional values:
\[ h = 4 \text{ (since } 5 \times 4 = 20\text{)} \]
\[ b = 0 \text{ (since } 20 \times 0 = 0\text{)} \]

So, now we have:
\[ 6r + 5(4) + 20(0) = 160 \]
\[ 6r + 20 = 160 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r \).
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 6r = 140 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ r = \frac{140}{6} \approx 23.33 \]

Since the number of rats must be an integer, we round up or down based on practical considerations but keep in mind the exact division would yield 23 rats because the remainder doesn't fit neatly into any other combination of rats, hamsters, or rabbits without fractions.

Therefore, Russell distributes **23** rats among the cages. 

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is}. 23<|im_end|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount that Mandy needs to pay Benedict including the accrued interest over the three-month period.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the monthly interest rate:**
   The interest rate is given as 2% per month. To find out what 2% means in decimal form, we divide 2 by 100.
   
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest for one month:**
   Since there is no information about the principal amount or the time periods, we assume the interest applies only to the outstanding balance at the end of each month.

   Let's denote the initial amount owed (principal) as \( P \). Given that \( P = \$100 \).

   After one month, the interest on the principal is calculated as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Interest for One Month} = P \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Interest for One Month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total interest over three months:**
   Since interest accrues monthly, we multiply the interest for one month by the number of months.

   \[
   \text{Total Interest Over Three Months} = \text{Interest for One Month} \times 3
   \]
   
   Substituting the value from step 2:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Interest Over Three Months} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

4. **Determine the total amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict:**
   This includes both the principal amount and the total interest accumulated over the three months.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The cost price (CP) for one bag of wheat = $20.
   - The selling price (SP) for one bag of wheat = $30.
   - The transportation cost per bag = $2.
   - Total profit made = $400.

2. **Calculate the net profit per bag:**
   - Net profit per bag = Selling Price - Cost Price - Transportation Cost
   - Net profit per bag = $30 - $20 - $2 = $8.

3. **Determine the number of bags sold based on the total profit:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bags sold.
   - Total profit = Net profit per bag * Number of bags sold
   - Total profit = $8 * \( x \)

Given that the total profit is $400, we can set up the equation:
\[ 8x = 400 \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
\[ x = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold a total of 50 bags of wheat.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The trader sold 50 bags of wheat.<|im_end|>","Each bag of wheat cost the trader $20+$2=$<<20+2=22>>22 (taking transportation costs into account)
Each bag of wheat was sold for $30 each giving a profit of $30-$22=$<<30-22=8>>8 on each bag
Since a total of $400 profit was made, the total number of bags sold is $400/$8=<<400/8=50>>50 bags

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fair tickets.
- Each ticket costs $20.25.
- There were 3 tickets purchased.

\[
\text{Total cost of tickets} = 3 \times \$20.25 = \$61.75
\]

### Step 2: Determine the cost of food.
- The cost of food was $4.50 less than the cost of tickets.

\[
\text{Cost of food} = \$61.75 - \$4.50 = \$57.25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of rides.
- Each ride costs $33.
- They went on 2 rides.

\[
\text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs to find the total amount spent.
- Tickets: $61.75
- Food: $57.25
- Rides: $66

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$61.75 + \$57.25 + \$66 = \$185
\]

### Step 5: Divide the total amount by the number of people (three).
- They split the costs evenly among three friends.

\[
\text{Amount each person pays} = \frac{\$185}{3} = \$61.67
\]

### Final Answer:
Each friend paid $\boxed{61.67}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.

They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate total weekly insect consumption for the flock:**
   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - There are 10 ducks in the flock.

2. **Sum up the weekly insect consumption for all ducks:**
   \[
   \text{Total weekly insect consumption} = 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} \times 10 \text{ ducks}

4. **Convert the total weekly insect consumption from weeks to days (since we want the daily consumption):**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

5. **Divide the total weekly insect consumption by 7 to get the daily consumption:**
   \[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the net change in tree population per year**

- Tom plants 10 trees.
- Tom chops down 2 trees.

Net change = Planting - Chopping = (10) - (2) = 8 trees added annually.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the death rate**

Since Tom adds 8 trees each year for 10 years, we calculate the total number of trees added over these years as follows:

Total trees added = Net change × Number of years = 8 × 10 = 80 trees.

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years before any trees die, we get:

50 + 80 = 130 trees.

**Step 3: Apply the 30% tree mortality rule**

We need to subtract 30% of the current total from the previous calculation because 30% of the trees will die.

Let's find out how many trees will be lost:

Number of trees that will die = Total trees * Mortality rate = 130 * 0.30 = 39 trees.

**Step 4: Subtract the number of trees that will die from the total number of trees after 10 years**

Finally, we subtract the number of trees that will die from the total number of trees calculated in Step 2:

Remaining trees = (Total trees after 10 years) - (Trees that will die)

Remaining trees = 130 - 39 = 91 trees.

Therefore, at the end of 10 years, Tom has **91 trees left**.<|im_end|>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the number of flamingos taken away on Saturday.
- Initially, there were 18 pink plastic flamingos.
- The neighbors took away one-third of these flamingos.
\[
\text{Number of flamingos taken} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flamingos left after taking some on Saturday.
\[
\text{Flamingos remaining after taking} = 18 - 6 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Add the additional flamingos on Sunday.
- On Sunday, the neighbors added 18 more pink plastic flamingos.
\[
\text{Total flamingos on Sunday} = 12 + 18 = 30
\]

### Step 4: Determine the number of flamingos that have been painted white.
- After taking 6 flamingos off, the remaining 12 flamingos were then painted white.
- Therefore, 6 flamingos were painted white.

### Step 5: Compare the total number of flamingos at noon.
- There are 30 pink plastic flamingos on Sunday afternoon.
- Since all the original 18 flamingos plus the 12 new ones (added on Sunday) make up the total number of flamingos on Sunday, we can conclude that all 30 flamingos are pink.
- Hence, there are no white flamingos present.

### Conclusion:
At noon on Sunday, there are no more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\boxed{\text{There are no more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos}}<|im_end|>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of crayons:**
   - Violetta buys crayons in five different colors.
   - Each crayon costs $2.

   So, the total number of crayons = Number of colors × Cost per crayon
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of crayons} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Violetta spends $2 on each crayon.
   
   Therefore, the total amount spent = Total number of crayons × Cost per crayon
   
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 10 \times 2 = \$20

3. **Subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:**
   - Violetta has $20 initially.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of one pen.
Given that one pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, we first need to find out how much all three items together cost.

- The cost of a pencil = $1.20
- The cost of an eraser = $0.30

So, the total cost for one pencil and one eraser is:
\[ \text{Total cost for one pencil and one eraser} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50 \]

Since one pen equals the combined cost of one pencil and one eraser, the cost of one pen is:
\[ \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.50 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 8 pens.
Now, if one pen costs $1.50, then the total cost for 8 pens would be:
\[ \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = \$12.00 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many pounds of carrots each restaurant will receive**:
   - We know that each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots.

2. **Calculate the total amount of carrots received by all restaurants**:
   - There are 40 restaurants.
   - Therefore, the total number of pounds of carrots received by all restaurants = \( 40 \times 2 \) pounds.

3. **Subtract the total amount of carrots received from the initial amount of carrots**:
   - Initial amount of carrots = 200 pounds.
   - Total amount of carrots received by all restaurants = \( 40 \times 2 \).

Let's perform these calculations:

\[ 
\text{Total amount of carrots received} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, subtract the total amount received from the initial amount:

\[ 
\text{Remaining amount of carrots} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children live in Soda based on the total population and the number of adults.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Total Population:**
   - We know that the total population (P) includes 8417 men and 9092 women.
   - Therefore, the total population P can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     P = \text{Number of Men} + \text{Number of Women}
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 8417 + 9092 = 17509
     \]

2. **Determine Number of Children:**
   - The total population (17509) is the sum of the number of adults (men and women).
   - Since all other individuals in the city are children, we subtract the number of adults from the total population to find the number of children.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Number of Children} = P - (\text{Number of Men} + \text{Number of Women})
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Number of Children} = 17509 - (8417 + 9092)
     \]
     Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \text{Number of Children} = 17509 - 17509 = 0

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of Pokémon cards**: Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards.

2. **After the first month**:
   - She collects three times her initial amount.
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
   
   So, after the first month, she has \(20 + 60 = 80\) Pokémon cards.

3. **Second month**:
   - She collects 20 fewer cards than what she collected in the first month.
   - Calculation: \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
   
   So, after the second month, she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) Pokémon cards.

4. **Third month**:
   - She collects twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months.
   - Calculation: \(2 \times (20 + 60) = 2 \times 80 = 160\) cards.
   
   So, after the third month, she has \(120 + 160 = 280\) Pokémon cards.

Therefore, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is \(\boxed{280}\).<|im_end|>","In the first month, Elaine collected 3*20= <<3*20=60>>60 pokemon cards.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the payment structure
- **Publisher A**: Paying Mark 5 cents per sentence.
- **Publisher B**: Paying Mark twice as much as Publisher A.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A:
\[ \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times \text{Payment from Publisher A} \]
\[ \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly earnings
Mark edits 1000 sentences each week.

For Publisher A (at 5 cents per sentence):
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 1000 \times 5 = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

For Publisher B (at 10 cents per sentence):
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 1000 \times 10 = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

### Step 3: Sum up the total earnings
Total earnings per week:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

### Final Answer
Mark makes $15000 in a week. The final answer is: The final answer is \( \boxed{15000} \) cents.<|im_end|>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pails Baldur drinks in a single day:**
   - Baldur drinks 5 pails in the morning.
   - Baldur drinks 6 pails in the afternoon.

2. **Add these quantities together to find the total number of pails consumed in a day:**

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount John earned over the course of a year after receiving the award and getting a raise.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the weekly increase due to the raise:**
   - John's current salary per week = $2000.
   - Raise percentage = 5%
   - Increase in salary per week = \(2000 \times 0.05 = 100\).

2. **Calculate the total increase in salary for the entire year:**
   - Number of weeks in a year = 52 (assuming a standard year).
   - Total increase in salary for the year = \(100 \times 52 = 5200\).

3. **Calculate the total amount earned before the award:**
   - Weekly earnings = $2000.
   - Total earnings before the award = \(2000 \times 52 = 104000\).

4. **Add the award to his total earnings:**
   - Award amount = $5000.
   - Total earnings including the award = \(104000 + 5000 = 109000\).

So, the total amount John made that year is $\boxed{109000}$.<|im_end|>","He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total grape production from all acres.
Josie has a 10-acre farm.

Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.

Total grape production = (Number of acres) × (Grapes per acre)

\[ \text{Total grapes} = 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} \]

\[
\text{Total grapes} = 50 \text{ tons}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many barrels of wine can be made from the total grapes.
Each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine.

Therefore, if she had 50 tons of grapes, the number of barrels that could be produced would be:

\[
\text{Barrels of wine} = \text{Total grapes} \times (\text{Wine per ton}) 
\]

\[
\text{Barrels of wine} = 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton}
\]

\[
\text{Barrels of wine} = 100 \text{ barrels}
\]

So, Josie's farm can produce **100 barrels** of wine per year.<|im_end|>","If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down Carl's cheese consumption step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches Carl eats:**
   - Carl eats a sandwich every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, Carl eats \(7\) sandwiches.

2. **Determine how many slices of cheese are used on each sandwich:**
   - Carl uses 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich.

3. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used on the sandwiches:**
   - Number of sandwiches = \(7\)
   - Slices per sandwich = \(2\)
   - Total slices from sandwiches = \(7 \times 2 = 14\)

4. **Calculate the number of eggs in each omelet (including those eaten during breakfast):**
   - Carl has 3 days of breakfasts where he eats cheese and eggs.
   - Let's denote the number of omelets as \(E\).

5. **Determine the relationship between the number of omelets and sandwiches:**
   - For each omelet, there is 1 more slice of cheese than on each sandwich.
   - Since he uses 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, he will use \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices of cheese on each omelet.

6. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used on the omelets:**
   - Number of omelets = \(E\)
   - Slices per omelet = \(3\)
   - Total slices from omelets = \(E \times 3\)

7. **Calculate the total number of slices of cheese used on all meals:**
   - Total slices from sandwiches = \(14\)
   - Total slices from omelets = \(E \times 3\)
   - Total slices from macaroni and cheese dish = \(8\)
   - Summing these up gives us the total slices of cheese used:
     \[
     14 + E \times 3 + 8
     \]

8. **Calculate the remaining slices after accounting for the macaroni and cheese dish:**
   - Total slices used = \(14 + E \times 3 + 8\)
   - Given that he finished eating his macaroni and cheese for several dinners throughout the week, we can assume he had enough macaroni and cheese to last for multiple dinners.
   - This means the total slices used equals the sum of the slices from all other items.

9. **Solve for \(E\):**
   - From the equation above, we know that the total slices used must equal the sum of the slices from sandwiches and omelets.
   - We need to find out if there was any leftover or excess cheese beyond what was needed for macaroni and cheese.

Given that the total slices used equals the sum of sandwiches and omelets plus the macaroni and cheese:

- If \(E = 0\), then no omelets were consumed.
- If \(E > 0\), then some omelets were indeed consumed.

Since the problem states he ate cheese and egg omelets 3 days, and considering the constraints provided:

- The only logical solution is if he consumed all available macaroni and cheese for dinner.

Thus, the number of slices of cheese used is determined by the macaroni and cheese dish alone since he finished eating it for several dinners.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 8 slices of cheese.<|im_end|>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pens Janet has after buying more pens and then sum up all her current pens.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of pens
Janet initially has:
- 22 green pens
- 10 yellow pens

Total initial number of pens = 22 + 10 = 32 pens

### Step 2: Determine the number of blue pen bags and their contents
Janet buys 6 bags of blue pens.
Each bag contains 6 blue pens.

Total number of blue pens = 6 bags * 6 pens per bag = 36 blue pens

### Step 3: Determine the number of red pen bags and their contents
Janet also buys 2 bags of red pens.
Each bag contains 9 red pens (as given).

Total number of red pens = 2 bags * 9 red pens per bag = 18 red pens

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pens after purchase
Total pens = Initial pens + Blue pens + Red pens

Substitute the values:
Total pens = 32 (initial) + 36 (blue) + 18 (red)

Total pens = 32 + 36 + 18 = 86 pens

Therefore, Janet has **86 pens** in total.<|im_end|>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the first five test scores:**
   - Brinley's scores for the first five tests are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - Sum these scores: \( 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 \).

\[
89 + 71 = 160 \\
160 + 92 = 252 \\
252 + 100 = 352 \\
352 + 86 = 438
\]

So, the total sum of the first five test scores is 438.

2. **Determine the target average after removing the lowest score:**
   - The desired average after removing the lowest score is 93.
   - Since there are six tests, the total sum needed to achieve an average of 93 over all six tests would be \( 93 \times 6 \).

\[
93 \times 6 = 558
\]

3. **Calculate the new total score required if the lowest score is removed:**
   - Subtract the lowest score (the current lowest score) from the total sum needed to reach the target average.

\[
438 - 86 = 352
\]

This means that if the lowest score is removed, Brinley needs a total score of 352 across the remaining five tests.

4. **Find the minimum score Brinley must achieve on the sixth test:**
   - To find out how much higher her sixth test score needs to be compared to the highest score among the first five, subtract her fifth test score from the total needed.

\[
352 - 100 = 252
\]

Therefore, Brinley needs at least a score of 252 on the sixth test to ensure her average remains at or above 93.

### Conclusion:
Brinley needs to score at least 252 on the sixth test to maintain an average of 93 over all six tests. 

{The final answer is} Brinley needs a score of 252 on the sixth test.<|im_end|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Michael rides his bike over the two different periods described.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael rides during the first period (4 weeks).

- **Frequency**: At least 5 times per week.
- **Distance per trip**: 25 kilometers.

First, determine how many trips Michael makes in one week:

\[
\text{Number of trips per week} = \frac{\text{Total trips}}{\text{Trips per week}}
\]

Since he does at least 5 trips each week:

\[
\text{Number of trips per week} = \frac{5}{x}
\]

Where \( x \) represents the number of trips per week. Since we don't know the exact number yet, let's use an arbitrary value for now because we'll be able to adjust as needed based on the information provided.

Now, multiply the number of trips per week by the distance per trip to find the total distance for one week:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \left(\frac{5}{x}\right) \times 25
\]

For simplicity, let’s assume \( x = 7 \):

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \times 25 = \frac{125}{7} \approx 17.85 \text{ km}
\]

Now, since he does this for 4 weeks:

\[
\text{Total distance in the first period} = 4 \times 17.85 \approx 71.4 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance Michael rides during the second period (3 weeks).

- **Frequency**: Only 2 times per week.
- **Distance per trip**: 60 kilometers.

Next, determine how many trips Michael makes in one week:

\[
\text{Number of trips per week} = \frac{\text{Total trips}}{\text{Trips per week}}
\]

Given he does exactly 2 trips each week:

\[
\text{Number of trips per week} = \frac{2}{y}
\]

Let's assume \( y = 2 \):

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \left(\frac{2}{2}\right) \times 60 = 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ km}
\]

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the weight of one chocolate bar**:
   - We are given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all chocolate bars**:
   - Joe has 25 chocolate bars.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars = \( 25 \times 40 \) grams.

3. **Calculate the weight of one candied apple**:
   - Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar.
   - So, if each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then each candied apple weighs \( \frac{40}{2} \) grams.

4. **Calculate the total weight of all candied apples**:
   - Joe has 80 candied apples.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples = \( 80 \times \left( \frac{40}{2} \right) \) grams.

5. **Add the weights together to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy**:
   - Total weight of chocolate bars: \( 25 \times 40 = 1000 \) grams.
   - Total weight of candied apples: \( 80 \times \left( \frac{40}{2} \right) = 80 \times 20 = 1600 \) grams.
   - Final total weight: \( 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \) grams.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days.

1. **Calculate the number of cakes bought on Monday:**

   - She bought three times the number of cakes from Monday.
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}

                    question:
                    Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 , less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. Calculate the total cost of buying each cup.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the cost per dozen for cups**

Given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200, we can find the cost per dozen by dividing the total cost by the number of dozens.

\[
\text{Cost per dozen cups} = \frac{\$1200}{20} = \$60
\]

So, each dozen costs $60.

**Step 2: Find the cost per plate**

We know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. Therefore, to find the cost per plate, divide the total cost by the number of plates in half a dozen.

\[
\text{Cost per plate} = \frac{\$6000}{6} = \$1000
\]

So, each plate costs $1000.

**Step 3: Verify the relationship between cups and plates**

According to the problem, the cost of half a dozen plates should be less than the cost of twenty dozen cups. Let's check if this condition holds true using our calculated values.

\[
\$1000 (cost of one plate) < \$60 (cost of one dozen cups)
\]

This inequality is not satisfied as written. However, the problem statement might have intended to compare the total cost, so we'll proceed accordingly.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying each cup**

Since each plate costs $1000 and there are half a dozen plates, we calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of half a dozen plates} = \frac{1}{6} \times \$1000 = \$1666.67
\]

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:

\[
\text{Total cost of buying each cup} = \frac{\$1200}{20} = \$60
\]

So, the final answer is:

The final answer is: **$60**.<|im_end|>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

                    question:
                    Sara wants to buy herself a new jacket , and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she wants costs $30 and each pair of shoes cost $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning $5 each time ; she babysits them. Her parents pay her . $4 each time she mows the lawn.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.
- Cost of the jacket: $30
- Cost of 2 pairs of shoes: $20 per pair × 2 = $40
- Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

### Step 2: Determine Sara's earnings from babysitting.
Sara earns $5 for each session and has already saved $10.

Total savings from babysitting: 
\[ 10 + (5 \times n) \]
where \(n\) is the number of sessions she works.

### Step 3: Determine Sara's earnings from mowing the lawn.
Sara earns $4 for each session.

### Step 4: Set up an equation based on the total amount needed ($70).

From Step 2, we know that her total earnings need to cover both the jacket and shoe costs plus any additional money she saves from other sources. Since we don't have information about what else she might save or earn, we'll assume her total savings will be sufficient if she continues working at her current rate.

Let's denote the number of times she mows the lawn as \(m\). Each time she mows the lawn, she earns $4, so her total earnings from mowing lawns would be \(4m\).

We set up the equation:
\[ 10 + (5n) + 4m = 70 \]

Here, \(n\) represents the number of times she worked as a babysitter, which we will find out in the next step.

### Step 5: Solve for \(n\).
First, simplify the equation:
\[ 10 + 5n + 4m = 70 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 5n + 4m = 60 \]

Since we need to find \(n\) such that \(m\) is also positive, let's express \(m\) in terms of \(n\):
\[ m = \frac{60 - 5n}{4} \]

For \(m\) to be an integer, \(60 - 5n\) must be divisible by 4. Let's test values of \(n\) starting from 0:

If \(n = 0\):
\[ m = \frac{60 - 5(0)}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

This value makes sense because it implies she could mow the lawn 15 times.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Sara must work as a babysitter 15 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

**The final answer is:** 15 times.<|im_end|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.
   
2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day.
   - Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day.
   - Jerry collects 42 eggs every day.
   - There are 2 more white chickens than red chickens.

From these points, we can write our first equation as:

\[ 3r + 5(w + 2) = 42 \]

This accounts for the total egg production from both types of chickens in one day. Simplify this equation:

\[ 3r + 5w + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 3r + 5w = 32 \]

Next, let's express \( w \) in terms of \( r \):

\[ 5w = 32 - 3r \]
\[ w = \frac{32 - 3r}{5} \]

Since \( w \) must be a whole number (because you can't have a fraction of a chicken), \( 32 - 3r \) must be divisible by 5. 

We also know that there are 2 more white chickens than red ones:

\[ w = r + 2 \]

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the divisibility condition:

\[ 32 - 3r \equiv 0 \mod 5 \]
\[ 32 - 3r \equiv 32 - 3(r+2) \equiv 32 - 3r - 6 \equiv 26 - 3r \equiv 0 \mod 5 \]
\[ 26 - 3r \equiv 3 \mod 5 \]

Now check when \( 26 - 3r \) equals 0 modulo 5:

- \( 26 \mod 5 = 1 \)
- \( 3r \mod 5 \)

So,

\[ 1 - 3r \equiv 0 \mod 5 \]
\[ 1 \equiv 3r \mod 5 \]
\[ 3r \equiv 1 \mod 5 \]

Find values of \( r \) such that \( 3r \equiv 1 \mod 5 \). We try different integers until we find a solution:

- \( r = 8 \):
  \[ 3(8) = 24 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \] 
- \( r = 13 \):
  \[ 3(13) = 39 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \]
- \( r = 18 \):
  \[ 3(18) = 54 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \]
  
Therefore, \( r = 8 \).

Finally, verify if it satisfies all conditions:

If \( r = 8 \), then \( w = r + 2 \):

\[ w = 8 + 2 = 10 \]

Check egg collection daily:

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs/day, so:

\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Each white chicken produces 5 eggs/day, so:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ eggs/day} \]

Total eggs collected daily:

\[ 24 + 50 = 74 \text{ eggs/day} \]

This doesn’t match the given data of 42 eggs/day. Therefore, recheck calculations or assumptions.

Rechecking shows no integer solutions where \( 3r \equiv 1 \mod 5 \) directly leads to valid \( r \). Hence, review input constraints or consider alternative interpretations may help correct approach. 

Final Answer: 
\[
\boxed{\text{Jerry has 8 red chickens}}

Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32

<|im_start|>super
To determine how long Gary spends walking around the perimeter of the park, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park**
- The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2(l + w) \]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.

Given:
- Length (\( l \)) = 1.5 miles
- Width (\( w \)) = 6 miles

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 2(1.5 + 6) \]

First, add the lengths together:
\[ 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 \]

Then multiply by 2:
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

So, the perimeter of the park is **15 miles**.

**Step 2: Calculate the time spent walking**
- Gary's walking speed is given as 3 miles per hour.
- To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends **5 hours** walking around the perimeter of the park.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of customers on the second day.
- On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day.

So, the number of customers on the second day = \( 100 + 50 \).

\[
100 + 50 = 150
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of customers over the three days.
- We know that the total number of customers after three days is 500.

Given that the sum of customers from Day 1 and Day 2 equals the total for all three days:

\[
100 (Day 1) + 150 (Day 2) = 250

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Jerry's small pool contains after the described changes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool.
   - Let \( B \) be the amount of water in the big pool.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
     \[
     B = 2S
     \]

3. **Current Conditions:**
   - The big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.
     \[
     B = 4S
     \]

4. **Leak Rate:**
   - Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

5. **Time Passed:**
   - Since it has been 4 minutes since the initial condition, the total time elapsed for both pools leaking is 8 minutes (4 minutes from the current state plus 4 minutes back).

6. **Volume Calculation:**
   - For the big pool:
     \[
     V_{\text{big}} = B - 4 \times 8
     \]
   - For the small pool:
     \[
     V_{\text{small}} = S - 4 \times 8
     \]

7. **Equations from Initial Conditions:**
   - From \( B = 2S \):
     \[
     V_{\text{big}} = 2S - 32
     \]
   - From \( B = 4S \):
     \[
     V_{\text{big}} = 4S - 32
     \]

8. **Setting Equations Equal:**
   - Since both expressions represent the volume of the big pool, set them equal:
     \[
     2S - 32 = 4S - 32
     \]

9. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2S - 32 = 4S - 32
     \]
     Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
     \[
     -32 = 2S - 32
     \]
     Add 32 to both sides:
     \[
     0 = 2S
     \]
     Divide by 2:
     \[
     S = 16

Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16

To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford both the shoes and the belt, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - The shoes cost $320.00.
   - The belt costs $32.00.
   - Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00.

2. **Determine how much money Lori makes per hour at her part-time job:**
   - She earns $8.00 per hour.

3. **Calculate the number of hours needed to earn $352.00:**
   - Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
   - Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00 = 46 hours.

Therefore, Lori will need to work for 46 hours to save enough money to buy both the shoes and the belt.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay**

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount.

- **Additional interest**: \( 2000 \times 10\% = 2000 \times 0.10 = \$200 \)

- **Total repayment amount**: \( 2000 + 200 = \$2200 \)

**Step 2: Determine how many payments Janeth will make**

She makes monthly payments for 12 months.

- **Number of payments**: \( 12 \) months

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over 12 months**

- **Monthly payment**: $165 per month

- **Total amount paid**: \( 165 \times 12 \)

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total amount paid from the total repayment amount**

- **Remaining balance**: \( 2200 - 1980 \)

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

### Final Answer
Janeth's remaining balance after making the required payments over 12 months will be $\boxed{220}$.<|im_end|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the given relationships, then calculate their combined age after three years, and finally find the average age.

Step 1: Determine Harriet's age after three years.
Harriet is currently 21 years old. In three years, she will be:
\[ 21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Step 2: Determine Zack's age from Harriet's information.
Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we can express Zack's age as twice Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} \]
Given that Harriet is 21 years old:
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old} \]

Step 3: Determine Adrian's age from Harriet's information.
Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} \]
Given that Harriet is 21 years old:
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total combined age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack after three years.
First, add the current ages together:
\[ 21 + 42 + 63 = 126 \text{ years} \]

Then, account for the additional three years:
\[ 126 + (3 \times 3) = 126 + 9 = 135 \text{ years} \]

Step 5: Find the average age of the three individuals after three years.
Calculate the average age by dividing the total combined age by three:
\[ \frac{135}{3} = 45 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the average age of the three individuals after three years is \(45\) years.<|im_end|>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.

In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each student scored. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Naomi's Score
Naomi scored 68 points.

### Step 2: Calculate Yuri's Score
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi’s score.
- First, find half of Naomi's score: \(\frac{68}{2} = 34\)
- Then add 10 to that value: \(34 + 10 = 44\)

So, Yuri scored 44 points.

### Step 3: Calculate Brianna's Score
Brianna scored 17 more points than Naomi.
- Since Naomi scored 68 points, Brianna scored: \(68 + 17 = 85\) points.

### Step 4: Calculate Jojo's Score
The total points scored by all four students is 251.
- We already know the scores for Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
- Subtract their scores from the total: 
\[ 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) \]

First calculate the sum of their scores:
\[ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 \]
Now subtract this sum from the total points:
\[ 251 - 197 = 54 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored **54** points.<|im_end|>","Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = <<68+17=85>>85 points

Jojo scored the rest 251 - 197 = <<251-197=54>>54 points
Jojo scored 54 points.

To determine how much time Carmen spent solving crossword and Sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the total time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then sum them up.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on crossword puzzles.
- Time per crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles = 3
- Total time for crossword puzzles = 10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles.
- Time per Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles = 8
- Total time for Sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Step 3: Sum the total time spent on both types of puzzles.
- Total time spent = Time on crossword puzzles + Time on Sudoku puzzles
- Total time spent = 30 minutes (crosswords) + 40 minutes (Sudoku) = 70 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of steps:

1. **Determine the initial amount of water in the tank:**
   The tank initially contains 120 liters of water.

2. **Calculate the remaining water after Celine uses some:**
   Celine uses 90 liters of water. So, subtracting this from the initial amount gives us:

   \]
   Therefore, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water collected from the rain:**

   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the final amount of water in the tank:**
   Adding the rainwater collected to the remaining water in the tank gives us:
   \[
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   After adding the rainwater, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost for both Carlos and Benji's rental activities.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Carlos**

- Carlos rents a canoe.
- The price per hour for the canoe is $30.
- Carlos uses the canoe for 3 hours.

Total cost for Carlos = Number of hours × Price per hour

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of days for the car journey:**
   - Andrew travels by bus for 6 days.
   - The car journey takes half as long as the bus journey.
   - Therefore, the car journey = \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

2. **Calculate the total number of days spent traveling:**
   - Days spent on the bus (New Jersey to Rochester): 6 days.
   - Days spent in the car (Rochester back to New Jersey): 3 days.
   - Total days spent traveling: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) days.

3. **Account for the round trip:**
   - If Andrew plans to go to Rochester by bus and return by car, we need to double the time spent on the car journey.
   - Double the time spent on the car journey: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) days.

4. **Add the round trip duration to the initial travel duration:**
   - Initial travel duration (bus to Rochester): 6 days.

                    question:
                    James is counting his Pokemon ? cards. He has 30 ! fire ? type, 20 grass type, and ! 40 water type. If he loses ? 8 . of the water type and buys 14 grass type, . what's the percentage chance . (rounded to the nearest integer) that a randomly picked card will be a water type?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards before any changes**

James initially has:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

Total initial number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

**Step 2: Adjust for the loss of water type cards**

James loses 8 water type cards.

New number of water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

**Step 3: Adjust for the purchase of grass type cards**

James then buys 14 more grass type cards.

New number of grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34

**Step 4: Calculate the new total number of cards after adjustments**

New total number of cards = 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96

**Step 5: Determine the probability of picking a water type card**

Probability = Number of water type cards / Total number of cards
= 32 / 96

**Step 6: Simplify the fraction**

Simplify the fraction:
32 ÷ 96 = 2/6 = 1/3

**Step 7: Convert the simplified fraction to a percentage**

Convert the fraction to a decimal first:
1/3 ≈ 0.3333

Now convert to a percentage:
0.3333 × 100 = 33.33%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance is 33%.

**Final Answer: The final answer is 33%.**<|im_end|>","First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the base burrito:**
   - Base burrito costs $6.50.

2. **Add the cost of the additional items (meat, cheese, avocado):**
   - Meat: $2.00
   - Cheese: $1.00
   - Avocado: $1.00
   - Total for these three items: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $4.00

3. **Calculate the total cost before upgrades:**
   - Cost of base burrito: $6.50
   - Cost of additional items: $4.00
   - Total before upgrades: $6.50 + $4.00 = $10.50

4. **Add the cost of upgrading his meal:**
   - Upgrading costs $3.00
   - Total after upgrade: $10.50 + $3.00 = $13.50

5. **Subtract the value of the gift card:**
   - Gift card worth $5.00
   - Amount still owed: $13.50 - $5.00 = $8.50

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is $8.50.<|im_end|>","He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how long it will take for Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle together, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Kalinda's rate of adding pieces:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine Mom's rate of placing pieces:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
     \[
     \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

3. **Find their combined rate of adding and placing pieces:**
   - Combined rate \( R_{total} \) is the sum of both rates.
     \[
     R_{total} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pieces in the puzzle:**
   - The puzzle consists of 360 pieces.

5. **Determine the time required to complete the puzzle at their combined rate:**
   - Time \( T \) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     T = \frac{\text{Total Pieces}}{R_{total}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     T = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of watermelons**: The farm produces 120 watermelons.
2. **Watermelons ready after two months**:
   - Ashlyn finds 30% of the watermelons are ready.
   - Calculate 30% of 120: \( 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons.
   - So, after two months, there are 36 watermelons ready for harvest.
3. **Remaining watermelons after two months**:
   - Subtract the 36 ready watermelons from the total: \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons left.

4. **Watermelons ready after two weeks**:
   - Two weeks later, 75% (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the remaining watermelons are ready.
   - Calculate 75% of the remaining 84 watermelons: \( 0.75 \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.
   - So, after two more weeks, there are 63 watermelons ready for harvest.
5. **Remaining watermelons after two weeks**:
   - Subtract the 63 ready watermelons from the 84 left over after two months: \( 84 - 63 = 21 \) watermelons left.

Therefore, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21.<|im_end|>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

To determine how much Mark pays in total for the cars and associated fees, we need to break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per car without taxes or registration fee.
Each car sells for $20,000.

### Step 2: Determine the tax on each car.
Mark pays an additional 10% tax on each car.

\[
\text{Tax per car} = 0.10 \times \$20,000 = \$2,000
\]

### Step 3: Add the registration fee to the car price.
Mark also incurs a registration fee of $1,000 per car.

\[
\text{Total per car before tax} = \$20,000 + \$2,000 = \$22,000
\]
\[
\text{Total per car after tax (including registration)} = \$22,000 + \$1,000 = \$23,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all 12 cars.
Since there are 12 cars, multiply the total per car by 12:

\[
\text{Total cost for all cars} = 12 \times \$23,000 = \$276,000
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything (cars and associated fees) is:

\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total number of penguins**: We start with 36 penguins.
2. **Penguins jumping**: One-third of the total penguins jump into the ocean. 
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins jump.
3. **Penguins swimming**: Another one-third of the total penguins swim in the ocean.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins swim.
4. **Penguins going inside the cave**: The remaining two-thirds (which is two-thirds since we already counted those that jumped or swam) go inside the cave.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \) penguins go inside the cave.
5. **Remaining penguins after these actions**:
   - Subtracting those that jumped from the total,
     \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) penguins remain after they jump.
   - Then subtracting those that swam,
     \( 24 - 12 = 12 \) penguins remain after they swim.
   - Finally, subtracting those that went inside the cave,
     \( 12 - 24 = -12 \).

Since it's not possible for any penguin to be negative, we need to re-evaluate our steps:

- First, let's correctly calculate how many penguins were actually accounted for in the first two steps before considering those that went inside the cave.
  
Let's correct the calculation:

1. Puppies jumping and swimming should be considered together as they both go outside.
2. Therefore, only one-third of the total penguins (jump + swim) would be considered outside.

So, let’s recalculate:

- Total penguins initially: 36
- Penguins jumping and swimming together: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)
- Remaining penguins after those who jump and swim: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \)

Now, out of these 24, two-thirds go inside the cave:
- Penguins going inside the cave: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \)

Thus, the remaining penguins left outside:

- Penguins still left sunbathing: \( 24 - 16 = 8 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}. 8.<|im_end|>","This many penguins are swimming: 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 penguins.

<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many total pens Ram will end up having after using his 25 pens to make new ones. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Purchase**:
   - Ram buys 25 pens.
   
2. **Ink Extraction Process**:
   - Ram takes 5 empty pens and extracts ink into one full pen.
   
3. **Total Pens Used in Inking Process**:
   - Since Ram used 5 empty pens to extract ink for one full pen, he effectively ""used"" these 5 empty pens as part of the process but doesn't count them again because they are now filled with ink.
   
4. **Remaining Empty Pens**:
   - After extracting ink, Ram has 20 remaining empty pens (since he started with 25 pens and used 5).
   
5. **New Pencils Made**:
   - From these 20 remaining empty pens, Ram makes new pencils using the extracted ink. Each time he uses an empty pen to fill another pen, he creates one new pencil.
   
6. **Number of New Pencils**:
   - The number of new pencils he makes is equal to the number of times he fills one empty pen to create ink for another pen. This means he makes 20 new pencils (one for each of the 20 remaining empty pens).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - Adding the original 25 pens plus the 20 new pencils gives us the total number of pens: 
     \[
     25 + 20 = 45
     \]

Therefore, Ram ends up with a total of **45 pens**.<|im_end|>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5

He will have 31 total pens because 25 + 5 + 1 = <<25+5+1=31>>31

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much money Johnny had before investing**
Johnny's initial allowance was $20.

So, before adding any extra money, Johnny had:
\[ \$20 \]

**Step 2: Add the extra money to Johnny's initial amount**
Johnny added an extra $10 to his allowance.

Therefore, the total amount of money Johnny had before investing is:
\[ \$20 + \$10 = \$30 \]

**Step 3: Determine how much money Johnny invested**
After adding the extra money, Johnny's total investment became:
\[ \$30 \]

**Step 4: Calculate how much money Johnny had after his investment tripled**
His investment tripled, so the amount became:
\[ 3 \times \$30 = \$90 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the final amount of money Johnny had after one year**
Since the problem states that his investment tripled in one year, his final amount would be:
\[ \$90 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on the given relationships and then find their total age.

1. **Determine Jessa's age**:
   - We know that Jessa is 20 years old.
   
2. **Calculate Joan's age**:
   - According to the problem, Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.
   - Therefore, Joan’s age = Jessa's age + 5
   - Substituting the value of Jessa's age: 
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate Mary's age**:
   - The problem states that Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Therefore, Mary’s age = Joan's age - 2
   - Substituting the value of Joan's age: 
     \[
     \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23
     \]

4. **Sum the ages of the three girls**:
   - Now, add up the ages of Jessa, Joan, and Mary.
   - Summing these values gives us:
     \[
     \text{Total age} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68

                    question:
                    The number of students in a school hall was 1000. The : hall had ? 3 ? entrances . A, B, , and C ! which also served as the exits.

C.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who left the building after the meeting.
- Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall.
- After the meeting, 30% of the students left the building.
- Therefore, the number of students who left = \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \).

### Step 2: Determine how many students left through each exit.
- Let's denote the number of students leaving through exit A, B, and C as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) respectively.
- According to the problem, 30% of the students (i.e., 300 students) left through exit A.
- Also, it states that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B, and the rest through exit C.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students leaving through exit B.
- Since 300 students left through exit A, the remaining students after exiting through A is \( 1000 - 300 = 700 \).
- Now, according to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of these remaining students leave through exit B.
- So, the number of students leaving through exit B is \( 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students leaving through exit C.
- We know that the total number of students leaving through all three exits must be equal to the initial number of students minus those who stayed in the building, i.e., \( 1000 - 300 = 700 \).
- This 700 should be equal to the sum of students leaving through A, B, and C.
- Therefore, \( A + B + C = 700 \).

### Step 5: Use the information about students leaving through exit B to find \( A \).
- From the previous calculation, we have \( A = 300 \).

### Step 6: Substitute \( A \) into the equation for \( A + B + C \).
- Substituting \( A = 300 \) into \( A + B + C = 700 \), we get \( 300 + B + C = 700 \).
- Solving for \( B + C \), we get \( B + C = 700 - 300 = 400 \).

### Step 7: Find the number of students leaving through exit C.
- We know that \( B + C = 400 \).
- To find \( C \), we can use the fact that the remaining students after exiting through A and B go through exit C.
- The number of students who stay in the building after exiting through A and B is \( 1000 - 300 - (B + C) \).
- Simplifying, we get \( 1000 - 300 - 400 = 300 \).
- These 300 students leave through exit C.
- Therefore, \( C = 300 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of students who went out through exit C is **300**.<|im_end|>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.
The number of students who didn't use exit A is 1000-300 = <<1000-300=700>>700
3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of candies James has.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   According to the information given:
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert: 
     \[
     J = R + 6
     \]
   
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert:
     \[
     J = 2R
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Candies Robert Has:**
   - We know that John has 54 candies:
     \[
     J = 54
     \]
   - Substitute \( J \) in the equation for John’s candies:
     \[
     54 = 2R
     \]
   - Solve for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Candies James Has:**
   - Using the value of \( R \), we can find \( J \):
     \[
     J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

5. **Find How Many More Candies John Has Than James:**
   - Subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
     \[
     54 - 33 = 21

To determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Reading Each Other’s Books**:
   - Since Dolly reads Pandora's book and vice versa, we need to consider these interactions.

3. **Calculating Total Reads for Each Person**:
   - For Dolly: 
     - She initially has 2 books.
     - Reading Pandora's book counts as one more book in her collection (since she doesn't have Pandora's book).
     - Therefore, after reading Pandora's book, Dolly now has 3 books total (her original 2 + 1 additional book).

   - For Pandora:
     - Initially, she has 1 book.
     - Reading Dolly's book counts as one more book in her collection (since she didn't have Dolly's book before).
     - Therefore, after reading Dolly's book, Pandora also has 3 books total (her original 1 + 1 additional book).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - By the end, both Dolly and Pandora together will have read 5 books (each person's initial 2 books plus the 1 book they exchanged).

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many pen pals Mike still has:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being a pen pal with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he still has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Each of the remaining 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   - So, the total number of letters sent per week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Calculate the total number of pages written per week:**
   - Each letter consists of 5 pages.
   - Thus, the total number of pages written per week is \(6 \times 5 = 30\).

4. **Determine how many pages Mike writes per hour:**
   - It takes him 6 minutes to write one page.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, he writes \(\frac{1}{6}\) pages per minute.
   - To find out how many pages he writes per hour, we multiply his writing rate per minute by 60 (minutes/hour):
     \[
     \text{Pages per hour} = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 60 = 10 \text{ pages}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time spent writing per week:**
   - Since he writes 30 pages per week and he writes 10 pages per hour,
   - The time he spends writing per week is \(\frac{30}{10} = 3\) hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Count**: Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Kyle Takes Fries**:
   - Kyle takes 5 fries.
   - After Kyle takes his fries, Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.

3. **Billy Takes Fries**:
   - Billy takes twice as many as Kyle (i.e., \(2 \times 5 = 10\)).
   - After Billy takes his fries, Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.

4. **Ginger Gives Fries to Griffin**:
   - Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives to Griffin as \(x\).
   - After receiving fries from Ginger, Griffin ends up with 27 fries.

5. **Colby Takes Fries**:
   - Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle originally took (i.e., \(5 - 3 = 2\)).
   - Before Colby takes any fries, Griffin still has \(9 + x\) fries after receiving from Ginger.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Since Colby takes 2 fries, we can set up the equation for Griffin's total fries: 
     \[
     9 + x - 2 = 27
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     7 + x = 27

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium.

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.
     - Number of snails in the first aquarium = 4
     - Number of snails in the second aquarium = 32
     - Difference between the number of snails = 32 - 4 = 28
     - Twice the number of fish in both aquariums = 2 * (number of fish in each aquarium)

   Therefore, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   28 = 2F
   \]

3. **Solve for \( F \):**
   \[
   F = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]
   So, each aquarium has 14 fish.

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is 14.<|im_end|>","The difference between the number of snails is 32 - 4 = <<32-4=28>>28 snails.

                    question:
                    Jeans . makeup artist charges her $250 an hour.  . She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is : in and it takes 6 hours to do each ? day . and she needs it done 4 times ; a week.  The movie ; takes 5 weeks to finish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the makeup services before and after the discount.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup.
- Each day, the makeup artist spends 6 hours.
- There are 7 days in a week (Monday to Sunday).
- Jean needs the makeup done 4 times per week.

First, calculate the total hours spent on makeup per week:
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks until the movie finishes:
\[ \text{Total hours until movie finishes} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

After the movie is finished, there's an additional 30 hours needed for the second movie (since 5 weeks - 2 movies = 3 weeks remaining):
\[ \text{Additional hours for second movie} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total hours spent on makeup is:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 120 \text{ hours} + 30 \text{ hours} = 150 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost without any discount.
The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 150 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$37,500 \]

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount.
A 10% discount means the artist will charge 90% of the original price.
\[ \text{Discounted cost} = \$37,500 \times 0.90 = \$33,750 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$33,750}
\]<|im_end|>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

To determine how much the chef spent on onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of onions purchased:**
   - The chef bought 4 bags.
   - Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \times 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication for the total weight:**

\[
4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

3. **Determine the cost per pound:**
   - Each pound costs $1.50.

4. **Calculate the total cost based on the total weight and the cost per pound:**

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Cost per pound}
\]

Substituting in our values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound}
\]

5. **Perform the multiplication for the total cost:**

\[
200 \times 1.50 = \$300

<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many cookies Sue ate on Monday.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 4 \times (\text{Cookies eaten by her sister})
\]

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 2 \times (\text{Cookies eaten by her sister})
\]

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by Sue} = 2 \times 13 = 26
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies Sue consumed over both days.
- Total cookies eaten by Sue = Cookies on Monday + Cookies on Tuesday

\[
\text{Total cookies eaten by Sue} = 20 + 26 = 46
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by her sister.
- Sister's total cookies = Cookies on Monday + Cookies on Tuesday

\[
\text{Sister's total cookies} = 5 + 13 = 18
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister.
- Calories per cookie = 200
- Calories from Sue's cookies = Total cookies * Calories per cookie

\[
\text{Calories from Sue's cookies} = 46 \times 200 = 9200
\]

- Calories from her sister's cookies = Total cookies * Calories per cookie

\[
\text{Calories from her sister's cookies} = 18 \times 200 = 3600
\]

### Step 6: Find the difference in calorie consumption.
- Difference in calories = Calories from Sue - Calories from her sister

\[
\text{Difference in calories} = 9200 - 3600 = 5600
\]

### Conclusion:
Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 5600.<|im_end|>","Sue’s Monday cookie intake is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students.
Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of boys and girls.
- The school has 50% boys and 50% girls.
  
Since the total number of students is 60:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many boys are in the first class.
We know that the first class has 15 girls.

Since the total number of students in the first class is 20:

\[
\text{Number of boys in the first class} = 20 - 15 = 5
\]

### Step 4: Find out how many boys are in the second class.
We know that the second class has 12 girls.

Since the total number of students in the second class is also 20:

\[
\text{Number of boys in the second class} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of boys in all three classes combined.
From Step 3 and Step 4, we have found the number of boys in the first and second classes.

Now add these together to get the total number of boys across all three classes:

\[
\text{Total number of boys} = 5 + 8 = 13
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total number of boys in the third class can be determined from the remaining boys after accounting for the first two classes.

Since we don't have specific information about the third class yet, we can only conclude based on the given data:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many wolves Rick killed today.
Rick killed three times as many wolves as he did last night. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Wolves killed today} = 3 \times (\text{Wolves killed last night}) \]
\[ \text{Wolves killed today} = 3 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Wolves killed today} = 30 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many cougars Rick killed today.
Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night. Last night, Rick killed 15 cougars. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Cougars killed today} = (\text{Cougars killed last night}) - 3 \]
\[ \text{Cougars killed today} = (15) - 3 \]
\[ \text{Cougars killed today} = 12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals Rick killed over two nights.
We add up all the animals Rick killed last night and today.

\[ \text{Total animals killed} = (\text{Wolves killed last night}) + (\text{Cougars killed last night}) + (\text{Wolves killed today}) + (\text{Cougars killed today}) \]
\[ \text{Total animals killed} = 10 + 15 + 30 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total animals killed} = 67 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total number of animals Rick killed is **67**.<|im_end|>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.
In total, he has 48+25 = <<48+25=73>>73 animals from the hunt.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.
2. Use that information to find out how many times Robert went down the slide.

Let's start with the given data:

- Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
- Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
- Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

Step 1: Calculate how many times Anne went down the slide.

Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's slides} = \text{Mitchel's slides} - (\text{Mitchel's slides} \times 30\%) \]

First, convert 30% into a decimal for easier calculation:

\[ 30\% = 0.3 \]

Now, perform the calculation:

\[ \text{Anne's slides} = 30 - (30 \times 0.3) \]
\[ \text{Anne's slides} = 30 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Anne's slides} = 21 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Step 2: Determine how many times Robert went down the slide.

We know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore:

\[ \text{Robert's slides} = 4 \times \text{Anne's slides} \]

Substitute Anne's number of slides:

\[ \text{Robert's slides} = 4 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Robert's slides} = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

   - Mr. Sylas divides these 240 cows equally among the 10 stalls.
   - Number of cows per stall: \(\frac{240}{10} = 24\).

5. **Cows in 8 Stalls**:
   - Since there are 24 cows in each stall, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of these stalls.
   - Cows in 8 stalls: \(8 \times 24 = 192\).

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. 192.<|im_end|>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.

Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

                    Brady is counting , the , money ; in . his : piggy ? bank. He has 100 ; pennies, , 40 nickels, 20 dimes, ; and 40 pieces of dollar bills. ; How much does Brady have in his piggy bank in , dollars?

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Number of pennies = 100
   - Value of pennies = \( 100 \times 0.01 = \$1.00 \)

2. **Nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Number of nickels = 40
   - Value of nickels = \( 40 \times 0.05 = \$2.00 \)

3. **Dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Number of dimes = 20
   - Value of dimes = \( 20 \times 0.10 = \$2.00 \)

4. **One Dollar Bills:**
   - Each one-dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Number of one-dollar bills = 40
   - Value of one-dollar bills = \( 40 \times 1.00 = \$40.00 \)

### Summing Up All Values:
\[
\$1.00 (pennies) + \$2.00 (nickels) + \$2.00 (dimes) + \$40.00 (one-dollar bills) = \$53.00
\]

Therefore, Brady has a total of **$53.00** in his piggy bank.<|im_end|>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the entire redwood.
- The redwood is 200 feet tall.
- Each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds.

First, determine how many 10-foot sections there are in 200 feet.
\[ \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Height per section}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \]

Next, calculate the total weight of all sections combined.
\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 2: Determine the amount of wood that termites have eaten.
- Termites eat 30% of the wood.

Calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites.
\[ \text{Wood eaten} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Percentage eaten} = 8000 \times 0.30 = 2400 \text{ pounds} \]

Step 3: Subtract the weight of the wood eaten from the total weight to find out how much remains.
\[ \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Wood eaten} = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. 5600 pounds.<|im_end|>","First find how many 10-foot sections are in the redwood: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = <<200/10=20>>20 sections

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Nancy has to pay in total, we need to calculate both the cost per book and the additional fees based on the number of overdue books.

1. Calculate the cost per book:
   - The cost per book is given as $0.50.
   
2. Calculate the total cost for all 8 books:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for books} = 8 \times \$0.50 = \$4.00
   \]

3. Determine if there are any extra fees applied:
   - The problem states that there is an additional flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue.
   
4. Calculate the total amount Nancy needs to pay:
   - Add the total cost for the books to the flat fee.
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the number of apples Andrea has:**
   - According to the problem, Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jamal has:**
   - The problem states that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
   - Therefore, we can set up an equation to find out how many apples Jamal has:
     \[
     \text{Apples}_{\text{Andrea}} = \text{Apples}_{\text{Jamal}} + 8
     \]
   - Given that Andrea has 52 apples, we substitute:
     \[
     52 = \text{Apples}_{\text{Jamal}} + 8
     \]
   - Solving for the number of apples Jamal has:
     \[
     \text{Apples}_{\text{Jamal}} = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits Jamal has:**
   - We know Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples, he also has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
   - Adding the number of apples and bananas together gives us:
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits}_{\text{Jamal}} = \text{Apples} + \text{Bananas} = 44 + 48 = 92
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Since Jamal has 44 apples (and thus 48 bananas), half of these would be:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Bananas}_{\text{Jamal}}}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
     \]
   - Adding the apples and the calculated banana amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits}_{\text{Andrea}} = \text{Apples}_{\text{Andrea}} + \text{Bananas}_{\text{Andrea}} = 52 + 24 = 76
     \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits Andrea has is 76.<|im_end|>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of cookies Carla needs to make.
2. Calculate how much flour is needed for that amount of cookies.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Determine the total number of cookies Carla needs to make.
- Today, Carla wants to make 36 cookies.
- Tomorrow, Carla wants to make 30 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies she needs to make is \(36 + 30 = 66\) cookies.

Now, let's move on to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate how much flour is needed for those 66 cookies.
We know from the problem statement that two cups of flour are needed to make one dozen (12) cookies. Since there are 66 cookies in total, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \left(\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}}\right) \times 66 \text{ cookies}
\]

\[
x = \left(\frac{2}{12}\right) \times 66
\]

\[
x = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 66
\]

\[
x = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Carla will need **11** cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.<|im_end|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

4. **Compare the total cost to Mrs. Cruz’s budget:**
   - Mrs. Cruz’s budget is $400,000.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500

                    question:
                    Mr. Tan sold his house for $400 000. He paid the transfer fees that amount to 3% of : the selling price and also paid a brokerage fee that is 5% of the selling price.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total transfer fees.
2. Calculate the total brokerage fees.
3. Add the remaining loan amount to the selling price.
4. Subtract the total fees (transfer and brokerage) from the selling price.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the Transfer Fees
The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.

- Selling Price = $400,000
- Transfer Fee Rate = 3%

\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = \text{Selling Price} \times \text{Transfer Fee Rate} \]

\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = \$400,000 \times 0.03 \]

\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = \$12,000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Brokerage Fees
The brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price.

- Selling Price = $400,000
- Brokerage Fee Rate = 5%

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = \text{Selling Price} \times \text{Brokerage Fee Rate} \]

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = \$400,000 \times 0.05 \]

\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = \$20,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Net Proceeds Before Loan Payment
First, calculate the total fees (transfer + brokerage).

\[ \text{Total Fees} = \text{Transfer Fee} + \text{Brokerage Fee} \]

\[ \text{Total Fees} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 \]

\[ \text{Total Fees} = \$32,000 \]

Next, add the remaining loan amount to the selling price.

\[ \text{Loan Amount} = \$250,000 \]

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Fees} \]

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 \]

\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \$368,000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are **$368,000**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the steps and calculate the total time taken.

1. **Heating the Oil to 300 Degrees:**
   - Time taken = 20 minutes

2. **Heating the Oil to 400 Degrees:**
   - The problem states that it takes 40% more time than heating it to 300 degrees.
   - Calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this additional time to the original 20 minutes:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Cooking Chicken:**
   - The problem also states that after warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   - Subtract 5 minutes from the total time calculated in step 2 (which includes both heating phases):
     \[
     28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent on both newspaper ads and television ads separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost for newspaper ads:**
   - The cost per newspaper ad is $5.
   - Number of newspaper ads = 50.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = 5 \times 50 = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for television ads:**
   - The cost per television ad is $75.
   - Number of television ads = 15.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for television ads} = 75 \times 15 = 1125
   \]

3. **Sum the costs from both types of ads:**

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Cost for television ads}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of bedrooms in both houses:**
   - John has 2 houses.
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.

   Therefore, the total number of bedrooms across both houses = \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

2. **Calculate the total number of windows per bedroom:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.

   So, for all bedrooms combined, the total number of windows = \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

3. **Identify the additional windows in one house:**
   - The question states that there are 4 additional windows in one house (not connected to others).
   
   Since these windows are in only one house, they do not add to the total count but rather represent extra windows within that specific house.

4. **Sum up the total number of windows:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of all items purchased**

- Cocoa at $4.20
- Laundry detergent at $9.45
- Pasta package at $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts together:

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65 (Cocoa and laundry detergent)
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00 (Total before adding the pasta)

Now, let's include the price of the pasta package:

$15.00 + $1.35 = $16.35 (Total after including the pasta)

So, the total amount spent on all items is **$16.35**.

**Step 2: Subtract the total amount spent from the amount paid**

The mother paid a total of $20.

Change given back = Amount paid - Total spent

Change given back = $20.00 - $16.35

Subtracting these values gives us:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stitches each sleeve takes in order to find out the total number of stitches needed for the entire sweater.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   - We know that the body of the sweater requires 900 stitches.
   - Let's denote the number of stitches in one sleeve as \( x \).
   - Since there are two sleeves, the total number of stitches for both sleeves would be \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:**
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches in the body.
   - Therefore, the collar uses \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.

3. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette:**
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Thus, the rosette uses \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.

4. **Sum up all the stitches:**
   - The total number of stitches required for the entire sweater is given as 1800.
   - This includes the body, collar, and rosette stitches.
   - So, we have:
     \[
     900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Determine the remaining stitches for the sleeves:**
   - Subtract the known stitches from the total stitches:
     \[
     1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
     \]
   - These 630 stitches will be distributed equally between the two sleeves.

6. **Find the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   - Divide the remaining stitches by 2 to get the number of stitches per sleeve:
     \[
     \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches per sleeve}
     \]

Therefore, each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Each sleeve takes 315 stitches}}
\]<|im_end|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.

The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

   - Total cost of tomato seeds = 20 * $40 = $800

2. Calculate the cost of celery seeds:
   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80
   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30
   - Total cost of celery seeds = 80 * $30 = $2400

3. Add the two amounts together to find the total cost of all seeds:
   - Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
   - Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

   - According to the problem, the first scene has ""twice the number"" of lines, so \( L_1 = 2L_2 \).
   - We also know that the first scene has ""six more lines than the song"", so \( L_1 = L_2 + 6 \).

2. **Solve for \( L_1 \):**
   - From \( L_1 = 2L_2 \), we can express \( L_2 \) as \( L_2 = \frac{L_1}{2} \).
   - Substitute \( L_2 \) into the equation \( L_1 = L_2 + 6 \):
     \[
     L_1 = \left(\frac{L_1}{2}\right) + 6
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2L_1 = L_1 + 12
     \]
   - Subtract \( L_1 \) from both sides:
     \[
     L_1 = 12
     \]

3. **Determine the number of lines for the second scene:**
   - Let \( L_2 \) be the number of lines in the second scene.
   - According to the problem, the second scene has ""six more lines than the song"".
   - Since the song has 54 lines, the second scene has \( L_2 = 54 + 6 = 60 \) lines.

4. **Calculate the number of lines for the first scene (excluding his own lines):**
   - The first scene has \( L_1 = 12 \) lines.
   - Only three-fourths of these lines are his own, so he has \( \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \) lines.

5. **Determine how many lines are not his in the first scene:**
   - The total number of lines in the first scene is 12, and he has 9 of those lines, so he has \( 12 - 9 = 3 \) lines left to memorize.

6. **Calculate the number of lines for the second scene (excluding his own lines):**
   - The second scene has 60 lines, and half of them are his, so he has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) lines.

7. **Determine how many lines are not his in the second scene:**
   - The total number of lines in the second scene is 60, and he has 30 of those lines, so he has \( 60 - 30 = 30 \) lines left to memorize.

8. **Sum up all the lines Sean needs to memorize:**
   - Lines for the first scene: 9 lines (not including his own)
   - Lines for the second scene: 30 lines (including his own)

So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \( 9 + 30 = 39 \).

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 39 lines.<|im_end|>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cards have each letter (A, B, C, or D) and then find out how many cards have the letter D.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter A.
Carly has 80 cards in total. 
\[ \text{Number of cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Number of cards with A} = 32 \]

#### Step 2: Determine the remaining number of cards after accounting for those with A.
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 80 - 32 \]
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter B.
Half of the remaining cards have the letter B.
\[ \text{Number of cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Number of cards with B} = 24 \]

#### Step 4: Determine the remaining number of cards after accounting for those with A and B.
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 48 - 24 \]
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter C.
Five-eighths of the remaining cards have the letter C.
\[ \text{Number of cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 \]
\[ \text{Number of cards with C} = 15 \]

#### Step 6: Determine the remaining number of cards after accounting for those with A, B, and C.
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 24 - 15 \]
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 9 \]

#### Step 7: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter D.
Since all the remaining cards have the letter D, there are no other letters involved.
\[ \text{Number of cards with D} = 9 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","The number of cards with the letter A on them is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Matthew to dig multiple small and large holes. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate time for one small hole
Given:
- Time to dig one small hole = 3 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate total time for 30 small holes
\[
\text{Total time for 30 small holes} = 30 \times 3 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate time for one large hole
Given:
- Time to dig one large hole = 10 minutes

### Step 4: Calculate total time for 15 large holes
\[
\text{Total time for 15 large holes} = 15 \times 10 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total time for both types of holes combined
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for small holes} + \text{Time for large holes}
\]
\[
= 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Convert total time from minutes to hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
\[
\frac{\text{Total time}}{60} \text{ hours}
\]
\[
= \frac{240}{60} \text{ hours}
\]
\[
= 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take Matthew **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.<|im_end|>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Understand the given information.
- Mico and Marco want to get to know each other.
- The sum of their current ages is 20.

Step 2: Determine the current ages of Mico and Marco.
Let's denote Mico's age as \( M \) and Marco's age as \( A \).
We have the equation:
\[ M + A = 20 \]

Step 3: Calculate the future ages of Mico and Marco after 10 years.
After 10 years, both their ages will increase by 10 years.
So, Mico's future age will be \( M + 10 \), and Marco's future age will be \( A + 10 \).

Step 4: Find the sum of their ages in 10 years.
Add their future ages together:
\[ (M + 10) + (A + 10) \]

Step 5: Simplify the expression.
Combine like terms:
\[ M + A + 20 \]

Step 6: Substitute the known value from Step 2.
Since we know \( M + A = 20 \), substitute this into our simplified expression:
\[ 20 + 20 \]

Step 7: Perform the addition.
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be **40**.<|im_end|>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.
   Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   - The first piece of information tells us that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. This can be written as:
     \[
     R = 6S
     \]

   - The second piece of information states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. This can be written as:
     \[
     R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
     \]

3. **Substitute the First Equation into the Second Equation:**
   From the first equation, we know \( R = 6S \). We can substitute \( 6S \) for \( R \) in the second equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

4. **Solve for \( S \):**
   Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
   
   Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( S \):
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]
   
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Sam is currently 6 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Peter paid in total for his purchases, we need to calculate the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream separately, then add them together.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles
- Number of popsicles: 20
- Cost per popsicle: $0.25

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Cost per popsicle}
\]

\[
= 20 \times 0.25
\]

\[
= 5
\]

So, Peter spent $5 on the popsicles.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars
- Number of ice cream bars: 4
- Cost per ice cream bar: $0.50

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Cost per ice cream bar}
\]

\[
= 4 \times 0.50
\]

\[
= 2
\]

So, Peter spent $2 on the ice cream bars.

### Step 3: Add the costs together
\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of popsicles} + \text{Total cost of ice cream bars}
\]

\[
= 5 + 2

\[
= 7

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of spots on one mamba.
2. Calculate the total number of spots on all cobras.
3. Calculate the total number of spots on all mambas.
4. Find the combined total number of spots for both snakes.
5. Divide that total by two.

Let's start with step 1: 

Step 1: 
We know that the cobra has 70 spots and it has twice as many spots as the mamba. Therefore, if the cobra has 70 spots, then the mamba must have \( \frac{70}{2} = 35 \) spots.

Next, let's move to step 2:

Step 2:
There are 40 cobras, so the total number of spots on all the cobras combined would be \( 40 \times 70 = 2800 \).

Then, let's proceed to step 3:

Step 3:
There are 60 mambas, so the total number of spots on all the mambas combined would be \( 60 \times 35 = 2100 \).

Now, let's move to step 4:

Step 4:
The combined total number of spots for both snakes is the sum of the spots from the cobras and the mambas, which is \( 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \).

Finally, let's move to step 5:

Step 5:
Half of the total number of spots is \( \frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \).

Therefore, half the number of spots they all have combined is 2450. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.

To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizzas, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the event**

- Number of team members = 12
- Number of coaches = 3
- Number of guests per team member = 2

Total number of guests brought by team members = \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

Now, add up all participants (team members + coaches + guests):

\[ 12 (\text{team members}) + 3 (\text{coaches}) + 24 (\text{guests}) = 40 \]

So, there are **40 people in total**.

**Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are needed**

Each pizza serves 3 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of people by the serving capacity of one pizza:

\[ \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

Since you can't order a fraction of a pizza, we round up to ensure everyone gets served. So, Maddy needs **14 pizzas**.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost**

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[ 14 \times 15 = \$210 \]

Therefore, **Maddy will spend $210** on pizzas.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of stories written by each person in the first week:**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

2. **Sum up the total number of stories written by all three in the first week:**

\[
20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ stories}
\]

3. **Determine how many times each person doubles their writing in the second week:**
   - Alani writes twice as much as she did in the first week.
   - Braylen also writes twice as much as he did in the first week.
   - Margot also writes twice as much as she did in the first week.

4. **Calculate the number of stories each person writes in the second week:**

- Alani’s second-week stories:
\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ stories}
\]

- Braylen’s second-week stories:
\[
2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ stories}
\]

- Margot’s second-week stories:
\[
2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ stories}
\]

5. **Add the second-week stories to the total from the first week to find the overall total:**

\[
120 \text{ (first week)} + 40 \text{ (Alani's second week)} + 80 \text{ (Braylen's second week)} + 120 \text{ (Margot's second week)}
\]

6. **Perform the addition:**

\[
120 + 40 + 80 + 120 = 360 \text{ stories}
\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is:

\[
\boxed{360} \text{ stories}
\]<|im_end|>","In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.

Braylen also wrote 40 stories in the first week, and on doubling that number in the second week the number became 2*40 =<<40*2=80>>80
His total number of stories in the two weeks is 80+40 = <<80+40=120>>120
Together, Alani and her brother Braylen had written 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 stories.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Ann's brother's current age:**
   - Ann is 9 years old.
   - Her brother is twice as old as Ann.

2. **Calculate the brother's current age:**
   \[
   \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Predict the brother's age in 3 years:**
   - We need to add 3 years to his current age.
   \[
   \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has initially:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth \(0.25\) dollars (since \(1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ quarters}\)).
   - Therefore, the value of 5 quarters is \(5 \times 0.25 = 1.25\) dollars.

   - Kelly also has 2 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth \(0.10\) dollars (since \(1 \text{ dollar} = 10 \text{ dimes}\)).
   - Therefore, the value of 2 dimes is \(2 \times 0.10 = 0.20\) dollars.

   - Adding both amounts together gives us the total amount of money Kelly has:
     \[
     1.25 + 0.20 = 1.45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of buying the can of pop:**
   - The can of pop costs 55 cents or $0.55 in dollars.

3. **Subtract the cost of the can from Kelly's initial amount:**
   - Subtracting $0.55 from her total of $1.45 gives us:
     \[
     1.45 - 0.55 = 0.90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Convert the remaining amount back into cents:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, converting $0.90 to cents results in:
     \[
     0.90 \times 100 = 90 \text{ cents}
     \]

Therefore, after buying the can of pop, Kelly will have \(\boxed{90}\) cents left.<|im_end|>","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rows of five stars (5-stars) are present in the flag.

1. **Identify the total number of stars:**
   - The flag has three rows of eight stars.
   - There are two rows of six stars.
   - Let's denote the number of rows of five stars as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of stars in the known parts of the flag:**
   - Three rows of eight stars: \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) stars.
   - Two rows of six stars: \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) stars.

3. **Determine the remaining number of stars that must be five stars:**
   - The total number of stars on the flag is 76.
   - Subtract the sum of the known stars from the total number of stars: 
     \[
     76 - (24 + 12) = 76 - 36 = 40
     \]
   So, there are 40 stars left to be arranged in rows of five stars.

4. **Find out how many rows of five stars can fit into the remaining stars:**
   - Since each row contains 5 stars, divide the remaining stars by 5:
     \[
     \frac{40}{5} = 8
     \]

Therefore, there are 8 rows of five stars on the flag.

**Final Answer:**  
There are \( \boxed{8} \) rows of five stars on the flag.<|im_end|>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.

Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones weighing 75 pounds each, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   - Weight per flagstone = 75 pounds.
   - Number of flagstones = 80.

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight per flagstone} \times \text{Number of flagstones}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} \times 80 \text{ flagstones}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight:**
   - Total weight that needs to be carried = 6000 pounds.
   - Each truck can carry up to 2000 pounds.

   To find out how many trucks are needed, divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Capacity of one truck}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000 \text{ pounds}}{2000 \text{ pounds/truck}}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000} = 3
   \]

Therefore, the landscaping company will need **3 trucks** to transport 80 flagstones on one trip.<|im_end|>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.

   - The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The car in the slow lane travels at half that speed.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles:**
   - Distance = 480 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   
   Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \),

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of medals Izzy has.
Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.

\[ \text{Izzy's Medals} = \text{Ali's Medals} - 5 \]

Substitute Ali's medals into the equation:

\[ \text{Izzy's Medals} = 22 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Izzy's Medals} = 17 \]

So, Izzy has 17 medals.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of medals they both have together.
Add the medals Ali and Izzy have to find their combined total.

\[ \text{Combined Medals} = \text{Ali's Medals} + \text{Izzy's Medals} \]

Substitute the values we found:

\[ \text{Combined Medals} = 22 + 17 \]
\[ \text{Combined Medals} = 39 \]

So, together they have 39 medals.

### Step 3: Find how many more medals were given compared to what they have.
We know that the total medals given out are 10 times the combined medals they have.

\[ \text{Medals Given Out} = 10 \times \text{Combined Medals} \]

Substitute the value from Step 2:

\[ \text{Medals Given Out} = 10 \times 39 \]
\[ \text{Medals Given Out} = 390 \]

Therefore, 390 medals have been given out for counting.<|im_end|>","Izzy has 22-5=<<22-5=17>>17 medal

   - There are 8 packets of chocolate bars.
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   \[
   \text{Total chocolate bars} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars each adult receives:**
   - Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
   - There are 4 adults.
   \[
   \text{Chocolate bars per adult} = 6
   \]
   - Total chocolate bars for all adults:
   \[
   \text{Total chocolate bars for adults} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining chocolate bars after adults have been given their share:**
   - Subtract the total chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars.
   \[
   \text{Remaining chocolate bars} = 40 - 24 = 16
   \]

4. **Determine the number of chocolate bars each child will receive:**
   - The remaining chocolate bars need to be divided equally among the 8 children.
   \[
   \text{Chocolate bars per child} = \frac{16}{8} = 2
   \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Susan earns from her online task, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Susan spends working:**
   - Susan starts at 8 a.m.
   - She works until 11 a.m., which means she has worked for 3 hours (since \(11 \text{ a.m} - 8 \text{ a.m} = 3 \text{ hours}\)).
   - Since she takes a break of half an hour after each 10-minute interval, we need to calculate how many 10-minute intervals fit into 3 hours.

2. **Convert the work duration to minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in one hour.
   - Therefore, 3 hours is equivalent to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

3. **Determine the number of 10-minute intervals in 180 minutes:**
   - Each interval lasts 10 minutes.
   - The number of intervals is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 18 \text{ intervals}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings based on the number of intervals:**
   - Susan earns $5 for each 10-minute interval.
   - With 18 intervals, her total earnings will be:

So, initially, the points are:
- Mike: 21
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42

### Step 2: Calculate Total Points After the Fourth Round

In the fourth round, each player receives an extra point if their current points exceed 20. We'll check each player individually:

- **Mike's Points after the fourth round**: Mike already has 21 points, which is greater than 20. So, he gets another point, making his total 21 + 1 = 22 points.
- **Jim's Points after the fourth round**: Jim already has 18 points, which is not greater than 20. So, he does not get any additional points.
- **Tony's Points after the fourth round**: Tony already has 42 points, which is also greater than 20. So, he gets another point, making his total 42 + 1 = 43 points.

Now, let's sum up the total points after the fourth round:
- Mike: 22
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 43

Adding these together gives us the total points after the fourth round:
\[ 22 + 18 + 43 \]

### Final Calculation

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 22 + 18 = 40 \]
\[ 40 + 43 = 83 \]

Therefore, the total number of points that all three friends have after the extra points were distributed is \( 83 \).

{The final answer is} 83 points.<|im_end|>","After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the age of the youngest son.
Since the youngest son is half as old as the oldest son, who is 8 years old, the youngest son's age is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years.

Step 2: Calculate how many oranges each son can wash based on their ages.
- The oldest son (age 8) can wash \( 8 \) oranges.
- The youngest son (age 4) can wash \( 4 \) oranges.

Step 3: Sum the number of oranges washed by both sons.
\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Step 4: Subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges bought.
Will originally bought \( 15 \) oranges, so after washing \( 12 \), the remaining number of oranges unwashed is:
\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Pushups
- First Day: 100 pushups
- Second Day: 100 + 20 = 120 pushups (since he does 20 more pushups on the second day)

Total pushups over two days: 
\[ 100 \text{ (first day)} + 120 \text{ (second day)} = 220 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Squats
- First Day: 50 squats
- Second Day: 50 - 10 = 40 squats (since he does 10 fewer squats on the second day)

Total squats over two days:
\[ 50 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 90 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Dumbbell Presses
- First Day: 20 dumbbell presses
- Second Day: \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) dumbbell presses (since he doubles the number of dumbbell presses on the second day)

Total dumbbell presses over two days:
\[ 20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \]

### Step 4: Summarize Total Activities Done Over Two Days
- Pushups: 220
- Squats: 90
- Dumbbell Presses: 60

Total count of all activities:
\[ 220 \text{ (pushups)} + 90 \text{ (squats)} + 60 \text{ (dumbbell presses)} = 370 \]

Therefore, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is **370**.<|im_end|>","The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last given that 5 people consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal (lunch and dinner), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total daily consumption**:
   - There are 2 meals per day.
   - Each meal consumes \(0.2 \text{ kg}\).
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 2 \times 0.2 \text{ kg} = 0.4 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate total weekly consumption**:
   - Weekly consumption is calculated by multiplying daily consumption by the number of days in a week.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 7 \times 0.4 \text{ kg} = 2.8 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount of rice consumed over a period**:
   - We have a 42 kg bag of rice available.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Total rice consumed} = 42 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of weeks the rice will last**:
   - Divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2.8 \text{ kg/week}} = 15 \text{ weeks}
   \]

### Conclusion:
A 42 kg bag of rice will last for 15 weeks.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: 15 weeks.<|im_end|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

To determine how many more or fewer crates Sam sold compared to his target, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of crates Sam actually sold:**
   - Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): Sam sold 20 crates.
   - Days not included in the calculation: Monday and Friday were closed, so no sales.
   - Sales on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday: 
     \[
     15 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 12 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 18 \text{ (Thursday)}
     \]

   Let's add these up:
   \[
   15 + 12 + 18 = 45
   \]

   Now, sum this with the weekend sales:
   \[
   45 + 20 = 65

2. **Compare the actual total to the target:**
   Sam’s target is 120 crates.

3. **Determine the difference between the actual total and the target:**
   \[
   120 - 65 = 55

Thus, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is} 55 crates.<|im_end|>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.

To determine how much the desk costs Carmen, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial bid and increment**: The first bidder starts at $200, and each subsequent bid increases by $50.

2. **Calculate the total amount bid by all participants**:
   - There are three other bidders.
   - Each of them bids twice (once before Carmen and once after).
   
Let's calculate the total amount bid by all participants:

- First bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
- Second bidder: $200 + $50 = $250
- Third bidder: $200 + $50 = $250

Since there are three other bidders who bid twice, we add their amounts together:

\[ 2 \times ($200 + $50) = 2 \times $250 = $500 \]

Now, let’s sum up all the amounts bid:

\[ $200 \text{ (initial bid)} + $500 \text{ (total from others)} = $700 \]

So, the total amount of money that Carmen pays for the desk is $700.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost John incurs for hiring a driving service over a full year. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of miles driven per day.
John drives from home to work and back each day. Therefore, the distance one way is 30 miles. Since he makes two trips (to work and back) in a day:

\[ \text{Miles driven per day} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of miles driven per week.
Since he works 5 days a week:

\[ \text{Total miles driven per week} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of miles driven per year.
There are approximately 52 weeks in a year:

\[ \text{Total miles driven per year} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 15600 \text{ miles/year} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost based on the mileage rate.
John pays $2 per mile driven:

\[ \text{Annual cost for mileage} = 15600 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$31200 \]

### Step 5: Add the monthly bonus.
He also receives a $150 bonus per month. There are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual bonus} = \$150 \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1800 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total annual cost.
Finally, add the annual cost for mileage and the annual bonus:

\[ \text{Total annual cost} = \$31200 + \$1800 = \$33000 \]

Therefore, John pays a total of $\boxed{33000}$ dollars annually for driving services.<|im_end|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Peter should exercise on Tuesday based on his exercise schedule.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday.
Peter exercised for 16 minutes on Monday.

### Step 2: Determine the total time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday.
According to the problem, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.

First, let's calculate the combined time from Monday and Sunday:
\[ \text{Total time on Monday and Sunday} = 16 + 23 \]

Now, double that total to find out how long he wants to exercise on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Time on Tuesday} = 2 \times (16 + 23) \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation.
Let’s do the addition first:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \]

Then, multiply the sum by 2:
\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \]

So, Peter wants to exercise for **78** minutes on Tuesday.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheets of paper are required to make a 32-page tabloid.

Step 1: Understand the structure of a tabloid.
A typical tabloid has two pages per sheet, folded horizontally into a single sheet of paper that looks like it's three-quarters full.

Step 2: Determine the number of sheets needed for one column of pages.
Since there are 32 pages total, and each sheet contains 2 columns of pages (one above the other), we divide the total number of pages by the number of columns per sheet:

\[ \text{Number of sheets} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per sheet}} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \]

So, you would need 16 sheets of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

What's ; the total amount of money ; she earned ? in the ! second , year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine how many books were sold in each year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the first year.
   - Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year (which is 45), we have \( x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:**
   - Books sold in the first year: \( x = 90 \)
   - Books sold in the second year: \( y \) (where \( y \) will be determined later)
   - Books sold in the third year: \( z \) (where \( z \) will be determined later)

3. **Set up an equation for the total number of books sold:**
   - The total number of books sold must equal the initial collection of 250 books.
   \[
   90 + y + z = 250
   \]

4. **Solve for \( y \) and \( z \):**
   - We know that \( y \) represents the number of books sold in the second year, and \( z \) represents the number of books sold in the third year.
   - To find \( y \) and \( z \), we need additional information or assumptions about their values.

5. **Given that there are currently 50 unsold books:**
   - This means the sum of books sold minus the number of unsold books equals the initial collection.
   \[
   90 + y + z - 50 = 250
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   40 + y + z = 250
   \]
   Solving for \( y + z \):
   \[
   y + z = 210
   \]

6. **Since \( y \) and \( z \) represent different years, they should not exceed the total number of books sold so far (90).**

7. **Assume \( y \) and \( z \) are such that \( y + z = 180 \)** (since 210 exceeds the maximum possible value considering only the current year’s sales):

8. **Substitute back to find \( y \) and \( z \):**
   - If \( y + z = 180 \) and \( y < 90 \), then \( z \) would need to be greater than 90, which doesn't fit our assumption.
   - Therefore, let's assume \( y \) and \( z \) are such that \( y + z = 150 \):
     - Then, if \( y = 60 \) and \( z = 90 \), this fits within our constraints since \( y + z = 150 \).

9. **Verify the solution:**
   - Total books sold: \( 90 + 60 + 90 = 240 \)
   - Unsold books: \( 250 - 240 = 10 \)
   - Corrected, now we can calculate the total earnings:
   - Earnings from each book: $20
   - Total earnings: \( 240 \times 20 = 4800 \)

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned is $\boxed{4800}$.<|im_end|>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.
The total number of books sold in the first and current year is 90+45 = <<90+45=135>>135.
The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.
If each book sells at 20$, then she earned 20*65 = $<<20*65=1300>>1300 in the second year

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Watson made in April when the company performed very well throughout the entire month, let's break down the calculation into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate Watson's daily earnings from his hourly wage.
- **Daily Earnings**: 
  \[
  \text{Hourly Wage} = \$10 \quad (\text{per hour})
  \]
  \[
  \text{Number of Hours per Day} = 10 \quad (\text{hours})
  \]
  \[
  \text{Daily Earnings} = \$10 \times 10 = \$100
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Watson's weekly earnings before bonuses.
- **Weekly Earnings Before Bonuses**:
  \[
  \text{Weekly Earnings (before bonuses)} = \$100 \times 5 = \$500
  \]

### Step 3: Add the weekly bonus to the total earnings.
- **Bonus per Week**:
  \[
  \text{Bonus per Week} = \$300
  \]
  - Since the company performed very well for the whole month, this bonus is added to the total.
  \[
  \text{Total Weekly Earnings Including Bonus} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800
  \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the amount of money Watson made in April, given that the company performed very well throughout the month, is $\boxed{\$800}$.<|im_end|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people John lost to in his arm wrestling matches.

Step 1: Determine the total number of people John competed against.
John competed against 20 people.

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of wins.
John beat 80% of his opponents.

Step 3: Convert the percentage to a decimal for easier calculation.
80% as a decimal is 0.80.

Step 4: Calculate the number of people John won.
Number of people John won = Total number of opponents × Percentage of wins
= 20 × 0.80
= 16

Step 5: Subtract the number of winners from the total number of opponents to find the number of losers.
Number of people John lost to = Total number of opponents - Number of winners
= 20 - 16
= 4

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:**
   - Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   - Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the morning = \(\frac{2}{3} \times 60\).

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses over 4 weeks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total weight lost by Joey:**
   - Joey loses 8 pounds per week.
   - Joey works for 4 weeks.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost by Joey} = 8 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[
   8 \times 4 = 32 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

   So, Joey loses a total of 32 pounds in 4 weeks.

3. **Determine Sandy's rate of weight loss:**
   - We know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.
   
   Since Joey loses 32 pounds in 4 weeks, Sandy must also lose 32 pounds in 4 weeks.

4. **Calculate Sandy's weekly weight loss rate:**
   - To find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose 32 pounds, we divide the total weight by the number of weeks she has to lose it.

   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss rate} = \frac{32 \, \text{pounds}}{4 \, \text{weeks}}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**

   \[
   \frac{32}{4} = 8 \, \text{pounds/week}
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Sandy can lose 32 pounds in 4 weeks if she maintains her current weight loss rate.

Therefore, it will take Sandy exactly **4 weeks** to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

{The final answer is} 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one tub of ice cream after the discount.
- Original price of one tub of ice cream = $13
- Discount on one tub of ice cream = $0.5
- Price after discount for one tub of ice cream = $13 - $0.5 = $12.5

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of two tubs of ice cream.
- Cost of one tub of ice cream after discount = $12.5
- Number of tubs of ice cream bought = 2
- Total cost for two tubs of ice cream = $12.5 × 2 = $25

### Step 3: Calculate the total savings from buying two tubs of ice cream.
- Original total cost without discount for two tubs of ice cream = $13 × 2 = $26
- Savings from two tubs of ice cream = $26 - $25 = $1

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of four packets of milk before the discount.
- Original price of one packet of milk = $11
- No discount on one packet of milk (since it's not mentioned)
- Price of one packet of milk = $11

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of four packets of milk after the discount.
- Since there is no discount mentioned for milk, the price remains unchanged.
- Price of one packet of milk = $11
- Number of packets of milk bought = 4
- Total cost for four packets of milk = $11 × 4 = $44

### Step 6: Calculate the total savings from buying four packets of milk.
- Original total cost without discount for four packets of milk = $11 × 4 = $44
- Savings from four packets of milk = $44 - $44 = $0

### Step 7: Calculate the total savings from both purchases.
- Savings from two tubs of ice cream = $1
- Savings from four packets of milk = $0
- Total savings = $1 + $0 = $1

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is} $1<|im_end|>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of new limbs grown after 15 days based on the given conditions: growing an extra arm every 3 days and an extra leg every 5 days.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the growth pattern**:
   - An extra arm grows every 3 days.
   - An extra leg grows every 5 days.

2. **Calculate the number of times each limb grows within 15 days**:
   - For arms: Since an arm grows every 3 days, in 15 days, the number of arms that grow is \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \).
   - For legs: Since a leg grows every 5 days, in 15 days, the number of legs that grow is \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).

3. **Sum up all the limbs grown**:
   - Total arms grown: 5 (as calculated above)
   - Total legs grown: 3 (as calculated above)

4. **Combine both results**: The total number of limbs grown is the sum of the arms and legs grown.

\[
\text{Total limbs grown} = \text{Number of arms} + \text{Number of legs} = 5 + 3 = 8
\]

### Conclusion:
After 15 days, the person would have grown a total of 8 new limbs from the Lots-of-Limbs Serum.

\[

<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on business suits.
- The price of one business suit is $100.
- Theo bought 6 business suits.

\[ \text{Total cost of business suits} = 6 \times \$100 = \$600 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on suitcase rentals.
- The price of one suitcase rental is $50.
- Theo rented 3 suitcases.

\[ \text{Total cost of suitcase rentals} = 3 \times \$50 = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Determine the additional cost of the flight ticket.
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a single business suit.

First, calculate 5 times the cost of one business suit:

\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]

Then, add $700 to this amount:

\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

### Step 4: Sum up all expenses so far.
- Cost of business suits: $600
- Cost of suitcase rentals: $150
- Cost of flight ticket: $1200

\[ \text{Total expenses so far} = \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the savings from Theo’s initial funds.
- Theo initially has $6000.

Subtract the total expenses from his initial funds:

\[ \$6000 - \$1950 = \$4050 \]

This leaves him with $4050 after covering the costs.

### Step 6: Deduct the amount saved for the trip.
- Theo wants to save $2000 specifically for the trip.

Thus, subtracting $2000 from his remaining funds:

\[ \$4050 - \$2000 = \$2050 \]

### Conclusion:
Theo has to spend **$2050** on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.<|im_end|>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.

Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of people in the family:**
   There are 5 people in the family.

2. **Determine who eats how many eggs per person per day:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each.
   - Two people eat 2 eggs each.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the first group (three people):**
   Each of the three people eats 3 eggs per day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs from the three people} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by the second group (two people):**
   Each of the two people eats 2 eggs per day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs from the two people} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

5. **Add the totals together to find the daily consumption:**
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 9 + 4 = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

6. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the daily consumption by 7.
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
   \]

Therefore, the family consumes **91 eggs** in a week.<|im_end|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
   - Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
   - Quinn is 30 years old.

2. **Calculate Jane's age based on Quinn's age:**
   - Since Quinn is 30 years old, Jane must be 3 years younger than Quinn.
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]

3. **Calculate Trent's age based on Jane's age:**
   - Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane,
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

4. **Verify the consistency of the ages:**
   - We have calculated that Jane is 27 years old (from step 2).
   - Therefore, Trent should be 5 years older than Jane, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]
   This matches our previous calculation from step 3.

                    question:
                    Six , years ago, . when Noah ; was , half as old ; as Cera, the population of Chile was half what : it , is now. Currently, Cera is ? 46 years old. If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times : the . age ! of Noah, ! calculate ? the population of Chile now.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
   - Let \( C \) be Cera's current age.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Cera is currently 46 years old (\( C = 46 \)).
   - The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah’s age at that time.

3. **Calculate Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Noah's age six years ago would have been \( N - 6 \).

4. **Population Relation:**
   - According to the given information, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
     Therefore,
     \[
     P_{\text{Chile, then}} = 3000 \times (N - 6)
     \]
     where \( P_{\text{Chile, then}} \) represents the population of Chile six years ago.

5. **Current Population Calculation:**
   - Now, we need to find the current population of Chile.
   - We know that the current population is twice the population in six years ago because Noah is half as old today as he was six years ago.

   So, the current population of Chile can be represented as:
   \[
   P_{\text{Chile, now}} = 2 \times P_{\text{Chile, then}}
   \]

6. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Substitute \( P_{\text{Chile, then}} \) from step 4 into the equation for the current population:
     \[
     P_{\text{Chile, now}} = 2 \times (3000 \times (N - 6))
     \]

7. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     P_{\text{Chile, now}} = 2 \times (3000 \times (N - 6)) = 6000 \times (N - 6)
     \]

8. **Determine Noah's Current Age \( N \):**
   - Since the current population of Chile is also given as twice the population six years ago, we equate the two expressions for the population:
     \[
     P_{\text{Chile, now}} = 2 \times (P_{\text{Chile, then}})
     \]
     Substituting \( P_{\text{Chile, then}} \):
     \[
     6000 \times (N - 6) = 2 \times 3000 \times (N - 6)
     \]

9. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - Divide both sides by \( 6000 \):
     \[
     N - 6 = \frac{2 \times 3000}{6000} \times (N - 6)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     N - 6 = \frac{2}{3} \times (N - 6)
     \]
     Factor out \( N - 6 \):
     \[
     N - 6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(N - 6)
     \]
     Divide both sides by \( N - 6 \):
     \[
     1 = \frac{2}{3}
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     N = 46 + 6 = 52
     \]

10. **Verify Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
    - Noah's age six years ago would have been:
      \[
      N - 6 = 52 - 6 = 46
      \]

11. **Check the Population Relation:**
    - Verify if the population relation holds true:
      \[
      P_{\text{Chile, then}} = 3000 \times 46 = 138000
      \]
      \[
      P_{\text{Chile, now}} = 2 \times 138000 = 276000
      \]

Thus, the calculations confirm Noah's age six years ago is indeed correct.

**Final Answer:**

Cera is currently 46 years old. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} Cera is 46 years old.<|im_end|>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.
Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, meaning Noah was 1/2*40 = 20 years.
If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to define variables for the number of players in each position and then set up equations based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( D \) as the number of players in the defense,
- \( O \) as the number of players on the offense,
- \( S \) as the number of players on the special teams.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The total number of players is 105.
2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense: \( O = 2D \).
3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense: \( S = \frac{1}{2}D \).

Now let's set up our equations:

1. Total number of players equation:
\[ D + O + S = 105 \]

Substituting the expressions from points 2 and 3 into the above equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]
\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{7}{2}D = 105 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{105}{\frac{7}{2}} \]
\[ D = 105 \times \frac{2}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \).<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many people will attend Martha's party, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited.
- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each.
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ people}
  \]
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each.
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ people}
  \]

Adding both groups together gives us the total number of people invited:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of people who cannot attend due to illness or previous commitments.

- 8 people could not attend due to illness.
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of those who could not be sick were previously committed.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
  \]

So, there were 2 people who were already committed but did not show up because they had previous commitments.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of people who cannot attend from the total number of invited guests.

\[
24 - (8 + 2) = 24 - 10 = 14 \text{ people}
\]

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.
2. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon now has.
3. Convert the total number of marbles into their equivalent weight.

Step 1: Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
- His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as Solomon bought.
\[
\text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8

Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon now has.
- Solomon initially had 50 marbles.
- He then received 20 + 8 more marbles.
\[
\text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 + 8 = 78
\]

Step 3: Convert the total number of marbles into their equivalent weight.
- Each marble weighs 2 kg.
\[
\text{Weight of marbles} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the pool first, then determine how much it costs based on the given rate.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
- The pool has dimensions of 6 feet (length) x 4 feet (width) x 5 feet (depth).
- Volume = length × width × depth

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication to find the volume in cubic feet.

\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Step 3: Determine the total cost to fill the pool at $0.1 per cubic foot.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per Cubic Foot} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \times 0.1 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of girls, boys, and non-gendered children in the classroom based on the given relationships.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the relationship between boys and girls:**
   - The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.
   
2. **Given data for boys:**
   - There are 30 boys.

3. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys,
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys}
     \]
     Substituting the number of boys (30):
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90
     \]

4. **Identify the relationship between boys and non-gendered children:**
   - The problem also states that there are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as boys.
   
5. **Given data for boys again:**
   - There are still 30 boys.

6. **Calculate the number of non-gendered children:**
   - Since there are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as boys,
     \[
     \text{Number of non-gendered children} = \frac{\text{Number of boys}}{10}
     \]
     Substituting the number of boys (30):
     \[
     \text{Number of non-gendered children} = \frac{30}{10} = 3
     \]

7. **Calculate the total number of children:**
   - To find the total number of children, add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of non-gendered children}
     \]
     Substituting the numbers we found:
     \[
     \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given ratio
We are given that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.

This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of wires per pole
Since the ratio is 1:3, it implies that for each pole, there are 3 wires.

### Step 3: Determine the number of poles based on the total number of wires
Given that the total number of wires needed is 45, we can set up the equation where \( P \) represents the number of poles:
\[ P \times 3 = 45 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( P \)
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully:

1. **Determine the initial total number of people:**
   - There are initially 25 men.
   - There are also 15 women.

   Therefore, the total number of people at the beginning of the party is:
   \[
   25 + 15 = 40 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of people who leave after one hour:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left.
   
   The number of people who left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people remaining after the departure:**
   - Subtract the number of people who left from the initial total:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Determine how many men remain at the party:**
   - It's given that 22 men remained at the party.

5. **Calculate the number of women remaining at the party:**
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of women remaining.
   - We know the total number of people remaining is 30, so:
     \[
     25 \text{ (men)} + W \text{ (women)} = 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( W \):
     \[
     W = 30 - 25 = 5

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of a pen based on the given information about magazines and books.

Step 1: Determine the cost of a magazine.
- We know that the magazine costs half as much as a book.
- The book costs $4.
- Therefore, the magazine's cost = $\frac{4}{2} = $2.

Step 2: Determine the cost of a pen.
- We know that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine.
- Since the magazine costs $2, then the pen must cost $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

Final Answer: The final answer is The pen costs $1.<|im_end|>","The cost of a magazine is $4/2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
The cost of a pen is $2 - $1 = $<<2-1=1>>1.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of pencils in one box:**
   - We know that the total number of pencils (including both in-box and loose) is 26.
   - This includes 2 loose pencils.
   - Therefore, the number of pencils in the boxes = Total pencils - Loose pencils = 26 - 2 = 24.

2. **Calculate the number of boxes needed for the loose pencils:**
   - Since each box contains an unknown number of pencils but we have information about the loose ones, let’s denote the number of boxes as \( x \).
   - Each box would then contain \( y \) pencils where \( y \) is a constant per box.
   - The total number of loose pencils divided by the number of pencils per box gives us the number of boxes needed for the loose pencils.
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes for loose pencils} = \frac{\text{Total loose pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}}
     \]
   - Given there are 2 loose pencils and assuming each box holds an equal amount, if each box contains \( z \) pencils, then:
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes for loose pencils} = \frac{2}{z}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining pencils after accounting for the loose ones:**
   - After removing the loose pencils from the total, we have:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pencils} = 26 - 2 = 24
     \]

4. **Divide the remaining pencils equally among the boxes:**
   - Let’s assume each box still contains \( y \) pencils as before, so we divide the remaining 24 pencils by \( y \):
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes needed for remaining pencils} = \frac{\text{Remaining pencils}}{\text{Pencils per box}}
     \]
   - Simplifying further, since each box now contains the same amount:
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes needed for remaining pencils} = \frac{24}{y}
     \]

5. **Sum up the total number of boxes required:**
   - Adding the boxes needed for the loose pencils and those needed for the remaining pencils gives us:
     \[
     \text{Total number of boxes} = (\text{Boxes for loose pencils}) + (\text{Boxes for remaining pencils})
     \]
   - Substituting our values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of boxes} = \left(\frac{2}{z}\right) + \left(\frac{24}{y}\right)
     \]

6. **Substitute back the value of \( z \):**
   - From the given information, we can determine \( z \). However, without knowing the exact distribution or individual amounts in each box, we cannot directly calculate \( z \).

Given that we don't have enough specific details to find \( z \), we conclude that the calculation depends on this variable. 

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{(\frac{2}{z} + \frac{24}{y})}
\]<|im_end|>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.
Thus, each box can contain 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8 pencils.
Together, Jam and Meg have 26 + 46 = <<26+46=72>>72 pencils.
Therefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.

                    question:
                    , Shannon ! makes herself iced coffee ! by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each : ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any , added liquid also weakens : the coffee. How many milliliters weaker ; is Shannon’s , iced : coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much the iced coffee becomes weaker after being cooled by 65 degrees and having 15 ml of cream added, we need to consider two effects: the cooling effect from the ice cubes and the weakening effect due to the additional liquid.

1. **Cooling Effect**: 
   - Each ice cube reduces the temperature by 13 degrees.
   - There are no restrictions on the number of ice cubes that can be added; therefore, the total cooling effect depends only on the quantity of ice used.
   
2. **Weakening Effect**:
   - The addition of any liquid (cream) will weaken the coffee by 12 ml for every 100 ml of coffee. This means if you add 15 ml of cream, the coffee will become weaker by \( \frac{15}{100} \times 12 = 1.8 \) ml.

Now let's calculate the total weakening:

- Cooling effect from ice: Since there is no upper limit on the number of ice cubes, the amount of coffee reduced in temperature is directly proportional to the volume of ice added. However, without knowing the exact volume or number of ice cubes, we can't precisely calculate this value. But we know that as long as ice is added, the coffee will cool down until it reaches the same temperature as the added ice.

- Weakening effect due to cream: As mentioned above, adding 15 ml of cream results in a weakening of 1.8 ml.

Since we don't have enough information about the initial volume of coffee before adding ice and cream, we cannot provide an exact numerical result. Therefore, the problem statement seems incomplete or misleading because it doesn't specify how much coffee was originally made. 

Given the information provided, we can conclude that adding cream would reduce the coffee by 1.8 ml, but the cooling effect from the ice could not be quantified without more details on the volume of ice added.

Thus, based on the given data and assuming all other conditions remain constant, the final answer would be:  
\[
\boxed{1.8 \text{ ml}}
\]<|im_end|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Understand the trading system**
- The store allows people to trade an old record (record) for a new one.
- For every 2 old records traded, you receive 1 new record.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of new records received**
Given that there were 7 new records left after 5 people participated:

\[ \text{Total new records} = 7 \]

Since each person trades 2 old records, we need to find out how many old records were traded in total:

\[ \text{Number of old records traded} = \frac{\text{Total new records}}{\text{Records per pair}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Number of old records traded} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of old records brought in**
Since each person brings in 2 old records:

\[ \text{Total old records brought in} = \text{Number of old records traded} \times \text{People} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total old records brought in} = 3.5 \times 5 = 17.5 \]

Therefore, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is **17.5**.<|im_end|>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the company spends on programming salaries. We'll break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of Junior programmers
Given that the number of Junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees:

- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of Junior programmers = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 100 \)

\[
\text{Number of Junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the salary for one Junior programmer
Each Junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.

\[
\text{Salary per Junior programmer} = \$2000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total salary for all Junior programmers
There are 40 Junior programmers, so their total monthly salary is:

\[
\text{Total salary for Junior programmers} = 40 \times \$2000 = \$80,000
\]

### Step 4: Determine the number of Senior programmers
Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are Junior programmers, the remaining must be Senior programmers:

\[
\text{Number of Senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the salary for one Senior programmer
Senior programmers earn $400 more than Junior programmers. Since Junior programmers are paid $2000, senior programmers are paid:

\[
\$2000 + \$400 = \$2400
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total salary for all Senior programmers
There are 60 Senior programmers, so their total monthly salary is:

\[
\text{Total salary for Senior programmers} = 60 \times \$2400 = \$144,000
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total monthly salary for all programmers
Summing up the salaries from both groups gives us the total monthly cost to the company:

\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = \$80,000 (\text{Junior}) + \$144,000 (\text{Senior})
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly salary} = \$80,000 + \$144,000 = \$224,000
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is **$224,000**.<|im_end|>","The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40

There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.
All the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the initial number of passengers:**
   - Initially, some people got on the bus at the terminal.
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of passengers.

2. **Add the additional passengers at the first bus stop:**
   - At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus.
   - So, the total after the first bus stop is \( x + 5 \).

3. **Subtract the passengers who got off at the second bus stop:**
   - At the second bus stop, 7 people got off the bus, but 8 more got on.
   - Therefore, the total before the second bus stop was reduced by 7 and increased by 8.
   - The equation for the total after the second bus stop is:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6
     \]

4. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - We know that the total number of passengers at the third stop is 20.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     x + 6 = 20
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 20 - 6
     \]
     \[
     x = 14
     \]

So, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the charging rate**: 
   - The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point (pp) every 3 minutes.

2. **Convert the initial charge state into a numerical value**:
   - At 60% charged, we can think of this as a 60 pp system because 100% = 100 pp, so 60% = 60 pp.

3. **Calculate how many times the phone needs to charge from its current level to reach 100%**:
   - We need to determine how many 3-minute intervals it takes for the phone to go from 60 pp to 100 pp.
   
4. **Divide the total number of pp needed by the charging interval**:
   - From 60 pp to 100 pp requires \(100 - 60 = 40\) pp more than what the phone has already.
   - Each time the phone charges, it increases by 1 pp.
   - Therefore, it will take \( \frac{40}{1} = 40 \) intervals of 3 minutes to achieve full charge.

5. **Calculate the total time required**:
   - Since each cycle is 3 minutes, the total time in minutes is \(40 \times 3 = 120\) minutes.

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours.

7. **Final Answer**:
   - It will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.

Therefore, the final answer is: **The final answer is 2 hours**.<|im_end|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.

Their last shopping trip, they spent $80. : This shopping trip, ? they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon . that took twice the amount , of : rewards off the price. How many dollars did the customer pay ? on this . shopping . trip?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Spending:**
   - The customer spent $80 in their last shopping trip.

2. **Rewards Application:**
   - They received a discount of $1 off for every $20 spent.
   - Since they spent $80, we calculate how many times $20 fits into $80:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ times}
     \]
   - Each time they receive $1 off, so they get $4 off from spending $80:
     \[
     4 \times 1 = \$4 \text{ off}
     \]

3. **Coupon Application:**
   - They also used a coupon that was worth twice as much as the rewards given.
   - The rewards were worth $4 off, so the coupon would be worth:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = \$8 \text{ off}
     \]

4. **Total Discount Calculation:**
   - First, subtract the discounts from the total spent:
     \[
     \$80 - \$4 (rewards) - \$8 (coupon) = \$78
     \]

5. **Final Amount Paid:**
   - After applying all the discounts, the customer paid $78 on this shopping trip.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\boxed{78}<|im_end|>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.
Their coupon was worth 4 * 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8.
Thus, they paid 43 - 4 - 8 = $<<43-4-8=31>>31 on this shopping trip.

                    question:
                    Nick is choosing between two jobs. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, and , is in a state ! with a 20% total tax rate.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs first.

**Step 1: Calculate the annual salary for Job A**

Job A pays $15 per hour for 2000 hours.
\[ \text{Annual Salary}_A = 15 \times 2000 = \$30,000 \]

Next, we apply the state tax rate to this amount.
\[ \text{Tax}_A = 30,000 \times 0.20 = \$6,000 \]
\[ \text{Net Pay}_A = 30,000 - 6,000 = \$24,000 \]

So, Job A offers a net pay of $24,000.

**Step 2: Calculate the annual salary for Job B**

Job B pays $42,000 annually.
\[ \text{Property Tax}_B = \$6,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Income}_B = 42,000 - 6,000 = \$36,000 \]

Now, apply the net income tax rate to this amount.
\[ \text{Tax}_B = 36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600 \]
\[ \text{Net Pay}_B = 36,000 - 3,600 = \$32,400 \]

So, Job B offers a net pay of $32,400.

**Step 3: Compare the net pay rates**

Comparing the net pay amounts:
- Net Pay_A (Job A) = $24,000
- Net Pay_B (Job B) = $32,400

Since $32,400 > $24,000, Job B has a higher net pay rate.

**Step 4: Determine how much more money Nick makes at Job B compared to Job A**

\[ \text{Additional Money}_B = 32,400 - 24,000 = \$8,400 \]

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is: $\boxed{\$8,400}$<|im_end|>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000

Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many castles are ruins.
2. Calculate how many of those ruins are unmanned.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of ruins:**
   - We know that 40% of the castles are ruins.
   - There are 220 castles in total.

   To find 40% of 220, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of ruins} = 220 \times \frac{40}{100}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses gives:
   \[
   \text{Number of ruins} = 220 \times 0.40
   \]
   Now, performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Number of ruins} = 88
   \]

Next, let's calculate the number of unmanned ruins:

2. **Calculate the number of unmanned ruins:**
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - We found that 88 castles are ruins.

   To find half of 88, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruins} = 88 \times \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses gives:
   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruins} = 88 \times 0.5

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the difference in costs between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for both options and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer**

- **Advance Payment**: $1,350
- **Monthly Installment**: $350
- **Number of Months**: 6

Total Cost = Advance Payment + (Monthly Installment * Number of Months)

\[
= 1350 + (350 \times 6)
\]

\[
= 1350 + 2100
\]

\[
= 3450
\]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $3450.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer**

- **Advance Payment**: $1,100
- **Monthly Installment**: $250
- **Number of Months**: 9

Total Cost = Advance Payment + (Monthly Installment * Number of Months)

\[
= 1100 + (250 \times 9)
\]

\[
= 1100 + 2250
\]

\[
= 3350
\]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $3350.

**Step 3: Find the difference in costs**

Difference = Total Cost of Furniture United's Offer - Total Cost of Cozy Homes' Offer

\[
= 3450 - 3350
\]

\[
= 100
\]

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100. The final answer is:

The final answer is: $100.<|im_end|>","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar required for both the suckers and the fudge.

**Step 1: Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers**

- Each batch requires 30 ounces.
- Number of batches = 8.

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Sugar per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches}
\]

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 240 \text{ ounces}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge**

- Each batch requires 70 ounces.
- Number of batches = 1.

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Sugar per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = 70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch}
\]

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = 70 \text{ ounces}
\]

**Step 3: Add the sugar from both batches**

\[
\text{Total sugar} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge}

Substitute the calculated values:

\[
\text{Total sugar} = 240 \text{ ounces (suckers)} + 70 \text{ ounces (fudge)}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's denote the number of students in the three groups as follows:

- Let \( x \) be the number of students in the two equal-sized groups.
- The third group has \( y \) students.

Given:
1. There are a total of 200 students.
2. One of these groups is smaller than the others.
3. The largest group is 10 more students than each of the other groups.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Since there are three groups, we have:
\[ x + x + y = 200 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x + y = 200 \]

2. We know one of the groups is larger, so it must be either \( x \) or \( y \).

Since the largest group is 10 more students than the other groups, we need to consider both possibilities for the largest group.

**Case 1: Largest group is \( x \)**

If \( x \) is the largest group, then:
\[ x = x + 10 \]
This implies:
\[ x - 10 = 0 \]
So,
\[ x = 10 \]

Now substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the equation \( 2x + y = 200 \):
\[ 2(10) + y = 200 \]
\[ 20 + y = 200 \]
\[ y = 180 \]

Thus, if \( x \) is the largest group, then \( y = 180 \), which means the second group also has 180 students.

In this case, all groups would have the same number of students, but since the problem states ""one of them is equal"", this case does not fit the description.

**Case 2: Largest group is \( y \)**

If \( y \) is the largest group, then:
\[ y = y + 10 \]
This implies:
\[ y - 10 = 0 \]
So,
\[ y = 10 \]

Now substitute \( y = 10 \) back into the equation \( 2x + y = 200 \):
\[ 2x + 10 = 200 \]
\[ 2x = 190 \]
\[ x = 95 \]

Thus, if \( y \) is the largest group, then \( x = 95 \), and the remaining group will have:
\[ 200 - 95 - 95 = 10 \]

Therefore, the smallest group has **10 students**.

Final Answer: The final answer is {The final answer is} 10.<|im_end|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.

   Also, we know there are twice as many chickens as cows:
   \[
   C = 2K
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve for One Variable:**
   Substitute \( C = 2K \) into the first equation:
   \[
   2K + K = 60
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3K = 60
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   K = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 cows.

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   Using \( C = 2K \):
   \[
   C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   Therefore, there are 40 chickens.

5. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs. The total number of legs can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = (C \times 2) + (K \times 4)
   \]
   Substitute \( C = 40 \) and \( K = 20 \):
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = (40 \times 2) + (20 \times 4)
   \]
   Calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160
   \]

**Conclusion:**
The total number of legs from all the animals combined is 160. Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.

                    Josh : decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month : in ; the future.

With a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with how many : balls?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this scenario step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Josh starts with 3 balls.
   - Each week, he adds 1 more ball.

2. **Progression**:
   - Week 1: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - Week 2: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - Week 3: 5 + 1 = 6 balls
   - Week 4: 6 + 1 = 7 balls

3. **Drop Situation**:
   - When Josh performs on the stage after the fourth week, he accidentally drops 3 balls.
   - Out of these 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught by people in the audience.
   - The remaining 1 ball rolls off the stage into the auditorium (dark area).

4. **Revised Counting**:
   - After dropping 3 balls, the number of balls left for performance should be calculated correctly before considering the drop.
   
   Let's calculate the total number of balls Josh has accumulated:
   - Week 1: 3 balls
   - Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - Week 4: 5 + 1 = 6 balls
   
   Total balls accumulated over 4 weeks = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 balls

5. **Adjustment Due to Drop**:
   - Josh drops 3 balls, out of which 2 are caught by the audience.
   - This means only 1 ball from the drop remains unaccounted for.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Before the drop, Josh had 18 balls.
   - After dropping 3 balls, he would have 18 - 3 = 15 balls available for performance.
   - Since only 1 ball was lost due to the drop, it doesn't affect the count of balls available for performance.

Therefore, the final answer is that Josh can still perform juggling with 15 balls after the drop incident.<|im_end|>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7

                    question:
                    A pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird. If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, calculate the total weight of a container carrying ! one of each animal ; if the container ! also weighs 20 pounds.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal based on the given information and then find the total weight of a container that contains one of each animal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the weight of the blue beetle:**
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle.
   - Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of the green toad:**
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad.
   - Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of the yellow snake:**
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
   - Let \( W_s \) be the weight of the yellow snake.
   - Therefore, \( 50 = W_s - 10 \).
   - Solving for \( W_s \):
     \[
     W_s = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the weight of the red bird:**
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - Let \( W_b \) be the weight of the red bird.
   - Therefore, \( 50 = W_b + 20 \).
   - Solving for \( W_b \):
     \[
     W_b = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Total Weight Calculation:

Now, let's sum up the weights of all animals in the container:

\[
\text{Total weight} = (\text{Weight of pink frog}) + (\text{Weight of blue beetle}) + (\text{Weight of green toad}) + (\text{Weight of yellow snake}) + (\text{Weight of red bird})
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, add the weight of the empty container:

\[
\text{Final total weight} = \text{Total weight} + \text{Weight of empty container}
\]
\[
\text{Final total weight} = 260 + 20
\]
\[
\text{Final total weight} = 280 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Conclusion:

The final answer is: \boxed{280} pounds.<|im_end|>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

To determine how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of baby outfits given by Laurel's friend**

Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

**Step 2: Determine the number of baby outfits Laurel received at the baby shower**

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits as what was given by her friend. 
Since her friend gave her 24 outfits,
\[ \text{Outfits from shower} = 2 \times 24 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Outfits from shower} = 48 \]

**Step 3: Add the gifts from the shower to the gift from the friend**
Now add the 24 outfits from her friend to the 48 outfits from the shower:
\[ \text{Total outfits so far} = 24 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total outfits so far} = 72 \]

**Step 4: Include the gift from Laurel's mom**
Laurel's mom gave her an additional 15 outfits.
So, we'll add these to the previous total:
\[ \text{Final Total} = 72 + 15 \]

Finally, let's perform this addition:
\[ \text{Final Total} = 87 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the new daily running distance after the increase.
Tyson initially runs 5000 meters per day. According to the coach's advice, he should run \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more than his current distance.

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\) of 5000 meters:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
\]

Now add this to his original distance:
\[
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day}
\]

So, after following the coach's advice, Tyson will run 6000 meters per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance Tyson covers in one month (30 days).
Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply his increased daily distance by 30:
\[
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
\]

Therefore, if Tyson follows the coach's advice and trains for a month, he would cover a total distance of 180000 meters. 

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{180000 \text{ meters}}
\]<|im_end|>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of Juice Box B.
We know that Juice Box B is $5 more expensive than Juice Box A. Given that Juice Box A costs $4, we can calculate the cost of Juice Box B as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = \text{Cost of Juice Box A} + 5 \]

Substituting the given value for Juice Box A:

\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = 4 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = 9 \]

So, Juice Box B costs $9.

### Step 2: Determine the cost of Juice Box C.
Next, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B. We know that Juice Box C is $7 more expensive than Juice Box A. Given that Juice Box A costs $4, we can calculate the cost of Juice Box C as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box C} = \text{Cost of Juice Box A} + 7 \]

Substituting the given value for Juice Box A:

\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box C} = 4 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Cost of Juice Box C} = 11 \]

So, Juice Box C costs $11.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
Finally, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Juice Box C} - \text{Cost of Juice Box B} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 9 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 2 \]

Therefore, Juice Box C costs $2 more than Juice Box B.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of tables with 4 legs:**
   - The restaurant has a total of 90 tables (40 tables with 4 legs + 50 tables with 3 legs).

2. **Calculate the number of tables that have 4 legs:**
   - Since there are 40 tables with 4 legs, all 40 of these tables will also have 3 legs.

3. **Calculate the number of tables that have only 3 legs:**
   - There are 50 tables with 3 legs in total.
   - Out of these, 40 tables already have 4 legs, so the remaining \(50 - 40 = 10\) tables will still have 3 legs.

4. **Sum up the total number of legs:**
   - Tables with 4 legs: \(40 \times 4\)
   - Tables with 3 legs: \(50 \times 3\)

Let's calculate this:

- Total legs from tables with 4 legs: 
\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

- Total legs from tables with 3 legs: 
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

- Summing both totals gives us:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many cookies Jenny buys in total**

Jenny buys 1 bag per week.

Bag contains = 36 cookies

So, Jenny buys **36 cookies per week**.

**Step 2: Calculate how many cookies are eaten by her son**

Her son eats 4 cookies every 5 days.

Number of weeks in a month ≈ 4 (since we're considering a week)

Cookies eaten by her son per week = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 4 \) cookies

\( = 4 \times \frac{4}{5} \)

\( = 4 \times 0.8 \)

\( = 3.2 \) cookies

Since you can't have a fraction of a cookie in practical terms, assume she rounds up or down based on context but here we'll consider the exact calculation.

**Step 3: Calculate how many cookies are eaten by her husband**

Her husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days.

Total cookies eaten by her husband per week = \( 1 \times 7 \) cookies

\( = 7 \) cookies

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining cookies after accounting for her son and husband**

Total cookies bought per week - Cookies eaten by her son - Cookies eaten by her husband = Remaining cookies

Remaining cookies = 36 - 3.2 - 7

\( = 36 - 3.2 - 7 \)

\( = 36 - 10.2 \)

   - Davos buys 2 shirts.
   
   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 2 \times \$30 = \$60

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount rate is 40%.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \$60 \times 40\% = \$60 \times 0.40 = \$24
   \]

3. **Subtract the discount from the original total cost to find out how much Davos actually paid:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the total cost.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Amount paid} = \$60 - \$24 = \$36

- Difference in revenue = Total revenue from tractors - Total revenue from silos
- Difference in revenue = $1000 - $1100 = -$100

Since the difference is negative, it means that the factory is actually losing money on silos when compared to tractors. Therefore, there is no increase or decrease; instead, there's a loss.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The factory is not making any more (or less) money; they are actually losing money on silos.<|im_end|>","They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly expenses**

- **Food**: $25 per week × 4 weeks/month = $100 per month
- **Treats**: $20 per month (no change)
- **Medicine**: $100 per month (no change)

Total monthly expenses = Food + Treats + Medicine
= $100 + $20 + $100
= $220 per month

**Step 2: Calculate the yearly expenses**

There are 12 months in a year.

Yearly expenses = Monthly expenses × Number of months/year

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday Yoga Class**:
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Tuesday Cooking Class**:
   - The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class.
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours

3. **Wednesday Cheese-Tasting Event**:
   - Duration: Half an hour (0.5 hours)

4. **Thursday Museum Tour**:
   - The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class.
   - Calculation: \(0.5 \div 3 = 0.167\) hours (approximately 1/6 of an hour)

5. **Friday Errands**:
   - Duration: Two hours

Now, let's add up the durations:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: approximately 0.167 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Summing these up gives us:
\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + 0.167 + 2\]

Let's do the addition step-by-step:
\[1 + 3 = 4\]
\[4 + 0.5 = 4.5\]
\[4.5 + 0.167 = 4.667\]
\[4.667 + 2 = 6.667\]

To determine how many plant pots April has left over after her donation, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of plant pots required for the roses:**
   - According to the problem, April asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.
   - She also needs twice as many for the roses.

2. **Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses:**
   - Twice the amount of daisy pots = \(2 \times 30 = 60\) pots for the roses.

3. **Total number of plant pots needed for both types:**
   - Daisies: 30 pots
   - Roses: 60 pots
   - Total: \(30 + 60 = 90\) pots.

4. **Subtract the total needed from what April already purchased:**
   - April initially bought 100 pots.
   - Required total: 90 pots.
   - Pots remaining: \(100 - 90 = 10\) pots.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - After fulfilling all donations (daisies and roses), April will have 10 plant pots left over.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is} 10.<|im_end|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Andrea has after spending.
- We know that after saving ""some"" money, she spent the remaining amount on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4.

Let's denote the amount Andrea saved as \( S \).

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money before spending.
- The total amount of money before spending can be represented as the sum of what she saved and what she spent on the sweater plus what she gave to her brother.
\[ \text{Total} = S + \$11 + \$4 \]

Step 3: Use the information about the total amount she had at the start to set up an equation.
- We know that the total amount before spending was $36.
\[ \$36 = S + \$11 + \$4 \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation to find \( S \).
\[ \$36 = S + \$15 \]
\[ S = \$36 - \$15 \]
\[ S = \$21 \]

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on other activities:**
   - Boating: 6 hours
   - Swimming: Half of the boating time (i.e., \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours)
   - Shows: Each show lasts 2 hours, and there are 3 shows. So, \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) hours

   Total time spent on other activities: 
   \[
   6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}

2. **Determine the total time John spent during his vacation:**
   Let \( T \) be the total time spent during the vacation.
   
   According to the information given, this time is 30% of the total time spent:
   \[
   T = 0.3T

3. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing.

   Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
   \[
   \text{Time Spent Sightseeing} = 0.4 \times T = 0.4 \times 2 = 0.8 \text{ days}

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine total earnings from both jobs:**
   - From the first job (where she works 20 hours):
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 20 \times \$10 = \$200
     \]
   - From the second job (where she works 15 hours):
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 15 \times \$5 = \$75
     \]

2. **Calculate total savings after working both jobs:**
   - Total amount saved so far (\$80) + Earnings from first job (\$200) + Earnings from second job (\$75)
     \[
     \text{Total Savings} = \$80 + \$200 + \$75 = \$355

3. **Subtract the cost of the phone from the total savings:**
   - Cost of the phone (\$400) - Total Savings (\$355)
     \[
     \text{Remaining Amount Needed} = \$400 - \$355 = \$45

   - The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree.

2. **Calculate the height of the second tree:**
   \[
   \text{Height of the second tree} = \text{Height of the shortest tree} + 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Substituting the value for the shortest tree:
   \[
   \text{Height of the second tree} = 6 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the total height of both shorter trees combined:**
   \[
   \text{Combined height of both shorter trees} = \text{Height of the shortest tree} + \text{Height of the second tree}

   Substituting the values calculated above:
   \[
   \text{Combined height of both shorter trees} = 6 \text{ feet} + 11 \text{ feet} = 17 \text{ feet}

4. **Calculate the height of the tallest tree:**
   - The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees.
   \[
   \text{Height of the tallest tree} = 2 \times (\text{Combined height of both shorter trees})
   \]
   Substituting the value obtained:
   \[

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money required for the activities and then divide it by the available budget.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for one round of mini-golf.
- One round of mini-golf costs $5.

Step 2: Determine the number of rounds needed for each friend.
- Since there are four people (Morgan + three friends), they will need to play 4 rounds of mini-golf.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the mini-golf.
- Total cost = Number of rounds × Cost per round
- Total cost = 4 × $5 = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the arcade tokens.
- Each person needs $5 worth of arcade tokens.
- For four people, the total cost is 4 × $5 = $20.

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the go-karts.
- Each go-kart ride costs $10.
- Since each person gets to ride the go-karts twice, the total cost per person is 2 × $10 = $20.
- For four people, the total cost is 4 × $20 = $80.

Step 6: Sum up the total costs for all items.
- Total cost = Mini-golf cost + Arcade token cost + Go-karts cost
- Total cost = $20 + $20 + $80 = $120

Step 7: Subtract the available budget from the total cost to find out how much more money is needed.
- Money needed beyond budget = Total cost - Budget
- Money needed beyond budget = $120 - $90 = $30

Since $30 exceeds the budget of $90, Morgan cannot afford to invite any friends.

Final Answer: {The final answer is} None of her friends can be invited since the total cost exceeds her budget.<|im_end|>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate daily spending on lollipops:**
   - Marisa spends $0.25 per lollipop.
   - Each day, she buys 4 lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Daily spending} = 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Determine total savings over 5 days:**
   - Since she saves all the remaining money after buying lollipops, we need to subtract her daily spending from her daily pocket money.

   \[
   \text{Total saving per day} = \$5 - \$1.00 = \$4.00
   \]

3. **Calculate total savings over 5 days:**
   - Multiply the daily savings by the number of days (5).

   \[
   \text{Total savings over 5 days} = \$4.00 \times 5 = \$20.00
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days is $\boxed{\$20.00}$.<|im_end|>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

                    question:
                    Billy is buying some candy with $10 his father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes ! half his change and spends it on , gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of money Billy has left after buying candy.
Billy starts with $10 from his father.

- Cost of one pound of candy = $1.5
- Number of pounds of candy Billy can buy = Total money / Cost per pound
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{10}{1.5} \]

Let's calculate the number of pounds of candy Billy buys first:

\[
\text{Number of pounds} = \frac{10}{1.5} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Billy buys approximately **6.67 pounds** of candy.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Billy gets after purchasing the candy.
After buying the candy, Billy will have the remaining money as his change.

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total Money} - (\text{Cost per Pound} \times \text{Number of Pounds})
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 10 - (1.5 \times \frac{20}{3})
\]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the candy:

\[
\text{Change} = 10 - (1.5 \times \frac{20}{3}) = 10 - \frac{30}{3} = 10 - 10 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since there is no change, Billy doesn't take any money back.

### Step 3: Determine how much money Billy spent on gumballs.
Billy took half of his original $10 in change to spend on gumballs.

\[
\text{Money Spent on Gumballs} = \frac{\text{Original Amount}}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many gumballs Billy bought.
Each gumball costs $0.05.

\[
\text{Number of Gumballs} = \frac{\text{Money Spent on Gumballs}}{\text{Cost per Gumball}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of Gumballs} = \frac{5}{0.05} = 100
\]

So, Billy bought **100 gumballs**.

### Step 5: Determine how many pounds of candy he bought.
We already calculated that Billy bought approximately **6.67 pounds** of candy.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{6.67 \text{ pounds}}
\]<|im_end|>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2
He had $4 in change because 2 / .5 = <<2/.5=4>>4

He bought 4 pounds of candy because 6 / 1.5 = <<6/1.5=4>>4

                    question:
                    Carver just ! turned 45 years old, which makes him ? 5 . years , less than twice the age of his son.  How old is his son, in , years?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Carver's son based on the information given about their ages.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Carver is turning 45 years old.
   - This means Carver will be exactly 45 years old after one year from now.

2. **Define the variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the age of Carver's son.

3. **Set up an equation based on the relationship provided:**
   According to the problem, Carver's age (which is 45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can write this as:
   \[
   45 = 2x - 5
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2x
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   50 = 2x
   \]
   Then divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

Therefore, Carver’s son is 25 years old. The final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{25}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.
Since Carver's age (45) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, then 45=(2*x)-5.
Add 5 to each side of the equation and we get 50=2*x.
Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance traveled in one round trip between three cities and then calculate how many days the train can operate before needing a service.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total distance for one round trip:**
   - From City 1 to City 2 (distance = 75 miles)
   - From City 2 to City 3 (distance = 100 miles)
   - From City 3 back to City 1 (distance = 50 miles less than 100 miles)

   Let's calculate the last part:
   \[
   100 \text{ miles} - 50 \text{ miles} = 50 \text{ miles}
   \]

   So, the total distance for one round trip is:
   \[
   75 + 100 + 50 = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of round trips per day:**
   The problem states that the train makes 3 round trips per day.

   Therefore, the total distance covered in one day is:
   \[
   3 \times 225 \text{ miles} = 675 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled over multiple days:**
   We need to find out how many days the train operates without needing a service.
   
   Given that the train needs service after covering 18,000 miles, let’s find out how many days it takes to cover 675 miles in one day.

   Since the train covers 675 miles per day, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Distance per Day}} = \text{Number of Days}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{675 \text{ miles/day}}{675 \text{ miles/day}} = 1 \text{ day}
   \]

Therefore, the train will need to stop for service once every 18,000 miles.

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the required number of stuffed animals:**
   - We have to create 4 beds for Chihuahuas.
   - We also have to create 3 beds for Collies.

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for one Chihuahua bed:**
   - Each Chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.

3. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for all Chihuahua beds:**
   - Since we need to make 4 Chihuahua beds, the total stuffing required is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.

4. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for all Collie beds:**
   - Each Collie bed requires an average amount of stuffing that is less than both the Rottweiler and the Chihuahua beds.
   - The average amount of stuffing for one Collie bed is calculated as follows:
     - First, find the difference in stuffing requirements between the Rottweiler (8 pounds) and the Chihuahua (2 pounds).
     - This difference is \(8 - 2 = 6\) pounds.
     - Next, divide this difference by 2 to get the average: \(\frac{6}{2} = 3\) pounds per Collie bed.

5. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for all Collie beds:**
   - Since we need to make 3 Collie beds, the total stuffing required is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) pounds.

6. **Add the stuffing needed for Chihuahua beds and Collie beds together:**
   - Total stuffing needed = Stuffed Chihuahua beds + Stuffed Collie beds
   - Total stuffing needed = \(8\) pounds (Chihuahua beds) + \(9\) pounds (Collie beds)
   - Total stuffing needed = \(8 + 9 = 17\) pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs a total of 17 pounds of stuffing to make 4 Chihuahua beds and 3 Collie beds.<|im_end|>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance John traveled**

- The original trip distance was 200 miles.
- John took a detour adding 10 more miles to his trip.
  
Total distance = Original distance + Detour distance
                = 200 miles + 10 miles
                = 210 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the detour**

John drove at a speed of 70 mph on the detour.

Time = Distance / Speed
      = 210 miles / 70 mph
      = 3 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance after the detour**

Remaining distance = Total distance - Detour distance
                  = 210 miles - 200 miles
                  = 10 miles

**Step 4: Calculate the time taken to go back home**

After arriving at his friend's house, John drives home using a different route that is 240 miles long.

Speed on the return trip is 80 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
      = 240 miles / 80 mph
      = 3 hours

**Step 5: Calculate the total time taken for the entire trip**

Total time = Time for detour + Time for return trip
            = 3 hours (detour) + 3 hours (return trip)
            = 6 hours

Therefore, the total time John spent on the trip is **6 hours**.<|im_end|>","The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles

   - There are 96 fourth-grade students in total.

2. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade girls:**
   - According to the information given, 43 girls are present.
   
3. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys:**
   - Since there are 96 fourth-grade students in total and 43 of them are girls, we can find the number of boys by subtracting the number of girls from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53

4. **Account for the missing students on Friday:**
   - On Friday, 5 girls were absent.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of boys who were absent.

5. **Set up an equation based on the number of boys present:**
   - The number of boys who were not absent should equal the number of boys who were present plus those who were absent:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present} + \text{Number of boys absent} = \text{Total number of boys}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information provided:

1. Four times as many customers were kicked out for not wearing masks.
2. The number of customers who refused to wear masks was equal to three times the number of shoplifters.
3. Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.

From these points, we can determine the number of shoplifters:
- Let \( S \) be the number of shoplifters.
- According to point 2: \( S = 4 \times (S - 5) \)
- Simplifying this equation gives us: \( S = 4(S - 5) \)
- Expanding and simplifying further: \( S = 4S - 20 \)
- Rearranging terms: \( 3S = 20 \)
- Solving for \( S \): \( S = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \)

Since the number of people must be an integer, let's round up or down appropriately. Given the context, it seems more logical to consider whole numbers here, so we'll assume \( S = 7 \).

Now, using the value of \( S \), we can find the number of customers who refused to wear masks:
- Number of customers who refused to wear masks = \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \)

We already know from point 3 that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence:
- Number of shoplifters = \( \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \)
- Number of people for physical violence = \( 3 \times 6.67 \approx 20 \)

So far, we have accounted for:
- Shoplifters: 7
- Customers who refused to wear masks: 21
- People for physical violence: 20

Given that the total number of people kicked out is 50, we subtract the sum of shoplifters, customers who refused to wear masks, and those for physical violence:
- Total: \( 20 + 21 + 7 = 48 \)

Therefore, the remaining number of people who were kicked out for other reasons is:
- Other reasons: \( 50 - 48 = 2 \)

Final Answer: Two people were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.<|im_end|>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers

                    question:
                    After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points ! than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many points Sara has after scoring.
Sara scored 8 points. According to the problem, after scoring, Erin has three times as many points as Sara.

\[ \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times \text{Sara's points} \]

Substitute Sara's points:

\[ \text{Erin's points} = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Erin's points} = 24 \]

So, after scoring, Erin has 24 points.

### Step 2: Calculate how many points Erin had before scoring.
We know that Erin has 14 points after scoring. To find out how many points she had before scoring, we subtract her current score from her total score.

\[ \text{Points before scoring} = \text{Total points} - \text{Current points} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Points before scoring} = 24 - 14 \]
\[ \text{Points before scoring} = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had **10** points before scoring.<|im_end|>","Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.

                    question:
                    44 seniors need to receive awards.  Each senior receives a picture ! frame that costs $20.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of senior frames needed.
There are 44 seniors, and each one gets a picture frame costing $20. So, the total cost for the frames is:
\[ \text{Total Cost of Frames} = 44 \times \$20 = \$880 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of picture frames needed.
Since there are 44 seniors, and each one gets a picture frame, the total number of picture frames required is 44.

### Step 3: Calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame.
Each frame has an additional cost of 20%, which means the logo adds another 20% to the frame's original price of $20. The additional cost per frame is:
\[ \text{Additional Cost per Frame} = \$20 \times 0.20 = \$4 \]
So, the total cost for etching the logo on all frames is:
\[ \text{Total Logo Etch Cost} = 44 \times \$4 = \$176 \]

### Step 4: Add the additional cost for etching the logo to the total cost of the frames.
\[ \text{Total Cost Including Logo Etching} = \$880 + \$176 = \$1056 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of seniors who will receive pins.
Out of the 44 seniors, \( \frac{1}{4} \) are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \text{Number of Officers} = 44 \times \frac{1}{4} = 11 \]
Since each officer receives a pin worth $5, the total cost for the pins is:
\[ \text{Total Pin Cost} = 11 \times \$5 = \$55 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of seniors who will receive cords.
Again, out of the 44 seniors, \( \frac{1}{4} \) are officers, so the number of officers is:
\[ \text{Number of Officers} = 44 \times \frac{1}{4} = 11 \]
Since each officer needs cords worth $12, the total cost for the cords is:
\[ \text{Total Cord Cost} = 11 \times \$12 = \$132 \]

### Step 7: Add up all the individual costs to get the total amount spent on gifts.
Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount spent on gift items:
\[ \text{Total Gift Cost} = \$1056 + \$55 + \$132 = \$1243 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent on senior gifts is:
\[
\boxed{\$1243}
\]<|im_end|>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.

The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.
The total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.

3. **Subtract the savings from the original price to find the DIY cost:**
   \[
   \text{DIY Cost} = 400 - 80 = 320
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the DIY option saved 20%, the final price for making the wallpaper yourself would be $320.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of equipment:**
   - The company initially bought $400,000 worth of equipment.
   - We need to find out how many pieces of equipment this amount can buy at the given price per piece.

2. **Determine the value of one piece of equipment:**
   - Since the total cost is $400,000 for all equipment,
     \[
     \text{Value of one piece} = \frac{\$400,000}{\text{Total number of pieces}}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of equipment purchased:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pieces.
   - Therefore, the value of one piece is:
     \[
     \text{Value of one piece} = \frac{\$400,000}{x}
     \]

4. **Find the number of faulty pieces of equipment (40%):**
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty,
     \[
     \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.4 \times x
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining non-faulty pieces:**
   - Subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:
     \[
     \text{Remaining non-faulty pieces} = x - 0.4 \times x = 0.6 \times x
     \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for the functioning pieces:**
   - Each non-faulty piece costs the same as the original purchase price.
   - Therefore, the total cost for functioning pieces is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times x \times \text{Value of one piece}
     \]
     Substituting the value found in step 3:
     \[
     \text{Cost for functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times x \times \left(\frac{\$400,000}{x}\right)
     \]
     Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{Cost for functioning pieces} = 0.6 \times \$400,000 = \$240,000

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $\boxed{240000}$.<|im_end|>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many sheep get 1 kg of milk daily**

Mary has 30 sheep in total. We need to find out how many sheep get 1 kg of milk.

- Half of the sheep will get 1 kg of milk.
\[ \text{Number of sheep getting 1 kg} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk collected from these 15 sheep**

Each of these 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk per day.

- The total milk produced by these 15 sheep per day is \( 15 \times 1 \) kg.
\[ \text{Total milk from 15 sheep} = 15 \times 1 = 15 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many sheep get 2 kg of milk daily**

Again, we need to find out how many sheep get 2 kg of milk.

- The remaining half of the sheep (i.e., another 15 sheep) will get 2 kg of milk per day.

**Step 4: Calculate the amount of milk collected from these 15 sheep**

Each of these 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk per day.

- The total milk produced by these 15 sheep per day is \( 15 \times 2 \) kg.
\[ \text{Total milk from 15 sheep} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ kg/day} \]

**Step 5: Sum up the total milk collected daily**

Now, we add the milk collected from both groups of sheep.

- Total milk collected per day = Milk from 15 sheep + Milk from other 15 sheep
\[ \text{Total milk collected per day} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg/day} \]

Therefore, Mary collects **45 kg of milk every day**.<|im_end|>","Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total revenue from Monday to Wednesday.
Lucy made a total of $56 from selling apples over the three days. Let \( T \) be the total number of apples sold over the three days. We know that:

\[ T = \$56 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples sold on Monday.
On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked. Let \( M \) be the number of apples sold on Monday. Since the price per apple is $4, we can write:

\[ 4M = \$56 \]
\[ M = \frac{\$56}{\$4} \]
\[ M = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of apples sold on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Lucy sold 12 apples.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of apples sold on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Lucy picked twice as many apples as she did on Monday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

\[ W = 2 \times M \]
\[ W = 2 \times 14 \]
\[ W = 28 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days.
The total number of apples picked over the three days is:

\[ T_{total} = M + 12 + W \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of socks**: Lindsay has 50 socks to wash.
2. **Determine the number of socks washed**:
   - She washes 10 pairs of socks.
   - Each pair consists of 2 socks.
   - Therefore, 10 pairs * 2 socks per pair = 20 socks from pairs.
   - She also washes 15 loose socks.
3. **Calculate the total number of socks washed**:
   - Total socks washed = Socks from pairs + Loose socks
   - Total socks washed = 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose)
   - Total socks washed = 35 socks

4. **Subtract the number of socks already washed from the total number of socks needed to find out how many socks were missed**:
   - Socks missed = Total socks needed - Total socks washed
   - Socks missed = 50 (total socks needed) - 35 (socks already washed)

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

{The final answer is} 15 socks.<|im_end|>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the monthly payment that Karan has to make on her loan over five months.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total interest:**
   - The principal amount (P) is $3,650.
   - The annual interest rate (r) is 10%, so the monthly interest rate is \( \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.00833 \).
   - The number of months (n) is 5.
   
   Using the formula for simple interest:
   \[
   I = P \times r \times n
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.00833 \times 5
   \]

2. **Perform the calculation:**
   \[
   I = 3650 \times 0.04165 \approx 152.375
   \]

3. **Add the total interest to the principal to get the total amount to be paid back:**
   \[
   A = P + I
   \]
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.375
   \]

4. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   A = 3650 + 152.375 = 3802.375
   \]

So, Karan has to pay approximately $3,802.38 per month over the five-month period.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 3802.38.<|im_end|>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how far each person traveled and then find the difference between their distances.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance hiked by Cho:**
   - Speed = 14 km/hour
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 14 \, \text{km/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 14 \times 8 = 112 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance hiked by Chloe:**
   - Speed = 9 km/hour (since the speed was not specified in the problem, we assume it's unknown)
   - Time = 5 hours (as given in the problem)

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 9 \, \text{km/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{km}
   \]

5. **Find the difference between the two distances:**

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km}

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many silver pesos Anna has.
2. Determine how many gold pesos Anna has.
3. Calculate the total number of silver pesos that both Axel and Anna have.
4. Calculate the total number of gold pesos that both Axel and Anna have.
5. Add the total number of silver pesos to the total number of gold pesos.

Step 1: Determine how many silver pesos Anna has.
Axel has 50 silver pesos. Since Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, we can calculate Anna's silver pesos as follows:
\[ \text{Anna's silver pesos} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Step 2: Determine how many gold pesos Anna has.
Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel. Since Axel has 80 gold pesos, we can calculate Anna's gold pesos as follows:
\[ \text{Anna's gold pesos} = 80 + 40 = 120 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of silver pesos that both Axel and Anna have.
We add the number of silver pesos each person has:
\[ \text{Total silver pesos} = 50 (\text{Axel}) + 100 (\text{Anna}) = 150 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gold pesos that both Axel and Anna have.
Since there is no information about gold pesos for Axel or Anna, we assume that only gold pesos are involved in the calculation. Therefore:
\[ \text{Total gold pesos} = 120 (\text{Anna}) = 120 \]

Step 5: Add the total number of silver pesos to the total number of gold pesos.
Finally, we add the total number of silver pesos to the total number of gold pesos:
\[ \text{Total peso sum} = 150 (\text{silver pesos}) + 120 (\text{gold pesos}) = 270 \]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is {270}.<|im_end|>","Axel has 50 + 80 = <<50+80=130>>130 pesos.

To determine Millie's profit per hour from selling lemonade, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade.**
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- There are 3 pitchers.

\[ \text{Total cups} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lemonade.**
- Each cup is sold for $1.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 36 \times \$1 = \$36 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of supplies.**
- The cost of supplies is $18.

**Step 4: Subtract the cost of supplies from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the time spent on sales in hours.**
- Assume Millie operates her stand for 10 hours (a common assumption).

\[ \text{Time spent on sales} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 6: Divide the profit by the time spent on sales to find the profit per hour.**

\[ \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\$18}{10 \text{ hours}} = \$1.80 \]

Therefore, Millie makes a profit of **$1.80** per hour from selling lemonade at her stand.<|im_end|>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the fraction of land that was not sold.
Since Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, the remaining part must be \(1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}\).

Step 2: Express the amount of land left in terms of the total land.
We know that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total land equals 12.8 hectares.

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total land.
Let \(x\) represent the total land Mr. Ruther originally owned. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

Step 4: Solve for \(x\).
Multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\) to isolate \(x\):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
x = 6.4 \times 5
\]
\[
x = 32
\]

Therefore, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

The final answer is:
The final answer is: 32 hectares.<|im_end|>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.

Let's break this problem into steps:

1. **Determine the number of male and female members:**
   - Total members = 52
   - 50% are boys, so the number of boys is \( \frac{52}{2} = 26 \)
   - 50% are girls, so the number of girls is also \( \frac{52}{2} = 26 \)

2. **Calculate how many will be performing on the day of the performance:**
   - Half of the girls can't make it (since they're only half), so the number of girls who can't make it is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \).
   - Therefore, the number of girls performing is \( 26 - 13 = 13 \).

3. **Calculate how many teachers join the performance:**
   - Since there are 3 teachers and all of them join, the total number of people joining the performance is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of people who performed:**
   - The total number of people who performed is the sum of the boys, girls, and teachers.
   - Total performers = Boys + Girls + Teachers = 26 + 13 + 3 = 42.

                    question:
                    To have the car for the weekend, Wilson's report card needs to show that he received 80 or higher in his math class.  His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test ! scores.  On those tests, he received: 65, 94, 81, 86 and 74.  What is his current math grade?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of all five test scores**
Wilson has taken five tests, and their scores are as follows:
- Test 1: 65
- Test 2: 94
- Test 3: 81
- Test 4: 86
- Test 5: 74

First, add up all the scores:

\[ 
\text{Sum} = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 
\]

**Step 2: Perform the addition**

Let's do this step-by-step:

\[ 
65 + 94 = 159 
\]
\[ 
159 + 81 = 240 
\]
\[ 
240 + 86 = 326 
\]
\[ 
326 + 74 = 400 
\]

So, the total score from all five tests is **400**.

**Step 3: Determine how many points above 80 Wilson needs to be**

Wilson needs at least an 80 on one of the tests. The highest possible score is 100 (if all tests were perfect).

Since he already scored 65, let’s calculate what score would give him 80:

If \( x \) is the score needed to reach 80, then:

\[ 
x = 80 - 65 = 15 
\]

He needs a minimum score of **15** to meet the requirement.

**Step 4: Find the average score required to achieve 80**

Now, we know he needs a total score of at least **400** (since the highest score is 100). Let’s denote the number of tests where he achieves at least 80 as \( n \). We can use the formula for the average:

\[ 
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}} 
\]

We want the average to be **at least 80**, so:

\[ 
80 \leq \frac{400}{n} 
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ 
80 \leq \frac{400}{n} \\
80n \leq 400 \\
n \geq \frac{400}{80} \\
n \geq 5 
\]

Therefore, Wilson must get at least **5 out of 5** tests to meet the requirement of having an average of 80 or higher.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Wilson will need to receive a **score of 80 or higher on at least 5 out of 5 tests** to ensure he meets the condition for the car rental.

Thus, the final answer is **The final answer is**: **Wilson needs to achieve at least a score of 80 on at least 5 out of 5 tests to qualify for the car rental**.<|im_end|>","He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.
- According to the information given, James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

Step 2: Calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.
- It is stated that James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.
- To find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu, we need to calculate 1/3 of 66.

Calculation for messages to Mr. Yu:
\[ \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 \]

Step 3: Perform the calculation.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost if both David and Dasha purchase rides in different ways and then determine who saves money.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of riding using tickets:**
   - There are 9 rides.
   - Each ride costs 2 tickets.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets needed is \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \) tickets.
   - Each ticket costs $2.
   - So, the total cost without any bracelets or other options would be \( 18 \times 2 = \$36 \).

2. **Calculate the cost of riding with a ride bracelet:**
   - A ride bracelet allows access to 9 rides for just $30.
   - This means that out of the 9 rides, only one ride costs extra (since the rest are included in the bracelet).
   - The total cost remains the same as above because the price structure doesn't change based on the type of ride.

3. **Determine the savings:**
   - If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys 7 tickets (which totals 14 tickets), their combined cost would be:
     - David's cost with the bracelet: $30 (bracelet + 1 ride)
     - Dasha's cost with tickets: \( 7 \times 2 = \$14 \)

4. **Compare the costs:**
   - Total cost if both use tickets: $36
   - Total cost if David uses a bracelet and Dasha uses tickets: \( 30 + 14 = \$44 \)

5. **Calculate the difference:**
   - Savings for David: \( 44 - 36 = \$8 \)

### Conclusion:
David saves $8 compared to the scenario where he buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys 7 tickets. 

{The final answer is} $8.<|im_end|>","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon Monica can use per gift bow given that she has a total of 144 inches of ribbon.

Step 1: Determine the number of gift bows Monica needs.
Monica has a total of 6 gifts to wrap, but only 2 of those are for her teachers. Therefore, she needs to wrap 4 gifts for her family and 2 gifts for her friends.

Number of gift bows needed = Number of gifts to be wrapped = 4 (family) + 2 (friends) = 6 gift bows.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of ribbon per gift bow.
Since Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon and she needs to wrap 6 gift bows, we divide the total length of ribbon by the number of gift bows.

Length of ribbon per gift bow = Total length of ribbon / Number of gift bows
= 144 inches / 6
= 24 inches

Therefore, Monica can use **24 inches** of ribbon for each gift bow.<|im_end|>","Monica is has 6 gifts for family + 4 gifts for friends + 2 gifts for teachers = <<6+4+2=12>>12 gifts to wrap.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's popsicles is 5:6.
- Together, they have 165 popsicles.

### Step 2: Determine the values based on the ratio
Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \).

Given the ratio 5:6, we can write:
\[ \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6} \]

This implies:
\[ B = \frac{5}{6}S \]

### Step 3: Set up an equation for the total number of popsicles
We know the total number of popsicles is 165:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substitute \( B \) from the previous step into this equation:
\[ \frac{5}{6}S + S = 165 \]

### Step 4: Combine like terms
Combine the terms involving \( S \):
\[ \frac{5}{6}S + \frac{6}{6}S = 165 \]
\[ \frac{11}{6}S = 165 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( S \)
Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[ 11S = 990 \]

Divide by 11:
\[ S = \frac{990}{11} \]
\[ S = 90 \]

So, Sam has 90 popsicles.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of popsicles Betty has
Since \( B = \frac{5}{6}S \), substitute \( S \) with 90:
\[ B = \frac{5}{6} \times 90 \]
\[ B = \frac{450}{6} \]
\[ B = 75 \]

So, Betty has 75 popsicles.

### Step 7: Find out how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty
Subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 \]
\[ S - B = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty}}
\]<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

Sam has 165-75 = <<165-75=90>>90 popsicles.
Sam has 90-75 = <<90-75=15>>15 more popsicles than Betty.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tim saves by switching to streaming services, let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost of the cable package.
- Cable package costs = $60 per month.

### Step 2: Determine the savings on individual services without bundling discounts.
- Netflix: $10/month
- Hulu: $10/month
- Disney+ (normal price): $10/month

Total savings from not bundling these services would be:
\[ \text{Savings} = 3 \times \$10 = \$30 \]

### Step 3: Apply the 20% discount for bundling.
- Bundled cost for Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+: 
\[ \text{Bundled cost} = \frac{\$60}{1.2} = \$50 \]

- Savings from bundling Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+: 
\[ \text{Savings from bundling} = \$50 - \$60 = -\$10 \]
(The negative value indicates an additional charge due to the bundled plan.)

### Step 4: Compare the total savings before and after bundling.
- Total savings before bundling = $30
- Total savings after bundling = -$10 (additional charge)

### Final Calculation:
- Net savings = Total savings before bundling - Total savings after bundling
\[ \text{Net savings} = \$30 - (-\$10) = \$40 \]

### Conclusion:
Tim saves $40 by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to the bundled streaming services.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is The net savings amount is $40.<|im_end|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

<|im_start|>system
To determine what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each task:**
   - Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
   - Time spent recording the song: Half the time spent writing = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes (which needs to be converted into hours)

2. **Convert all times to the same unit for consistency:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert 90 minutes to hours.
     \[
     \text{Time spent editing in hours} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Sum up the total time spent on all tasks:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Writing time} + \text{Recording time} + \text{Editing time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent editing:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100

   \[
   \text{Percentage spent editing} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage spent editing} = 0.2 \times 100

- Slices for Bill = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12\)

Calculating that:
\[ \text{Slices for Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of slices given to Mark**
Jenny gives Mark \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the pizza.
- Total slices in the pizza = 12
- Slices for Mark = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12\)

Calculating that:
\[ \text{Slices for Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices given away (to Bill and Mark)**

Adding the slices given to Bill and Mark:

                    Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, ! 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and a number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. How many bugs did she count total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different types of insects Nancy found in the woodshed and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of millipedes
Nancy saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.
- Number of spiders = \(90\)
- Number of millipedes = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30\)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stink bugs
The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
- Number of stink bugs = \(2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48\)

### Step 3: Sum up all the insects
- Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
- Total number of bugs = \(90 + 30 + 48 = 168\)

### Final Answer
\[

Then subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs
Then add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Beth's age**:
   - We know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
   - If we let Beth's age be \( B \), then Alice's age would be \( B + 7 \).
   
2. **Determine Erica's age**:
   - We also know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
   - Since Beth's age is \( B \), Erica's age would be \( B - 5 \).

3. **Given information about Erica's age**:
   - The problem states that Erica is 30 years old.

4. **Set up an equation to find Beth's age**:
   - From step 2, since Erica is \( B - 5 \) and she is 30 years old, we can write: 
     \[
     B - 5 = 30
     \]

5. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     B = 30 + 5 = 35
     \]
   - So, Beth is 35 years old.

6. **Find Alice's age**:
   - Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is:
     \[
     A = B + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42
     \]

7. **Calculate the difference in ages between Alice and Erica**:
   - Erica is 30 years old, and Alice is 42 years old.
   - The difference in their ages is:
     \[
     A - E = 42 - 30 = 12

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to break down his work schedule into its components and then calculate his earnings based on those components.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of working days per year
- The builder works for **4 weeks** every month.
- There are **3 months** in a quarter (since there are 4 quarters in a year).
- Therefore, the total number of working days per year is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total working days} = (\text{working weeks per month}) \times (\text{months per year}) \]

\[
= 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ working days per quarter}
\]

- Since there are **4 quarters in a year**, we multiply this by 4:

\[ \text{Total working days per year} = 12 \times 4 = 48 \text{ working days} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned
- The builder gets paid **$50 per day**.
- We now calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total number of working days by his daily wage:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total working days} \times \text{Daily wage} \]

\[
= 48 \times 50 = \$2400

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many more bags of flour Mark needs compared to bottles of milk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total ingredients needed:**
   - For the brownie mixture (excluding flour and milk):
     \[
     \text{Total ingredients} = 4 \times (\text{normal recipe ingredients})
     \]
     Since the normal recipe uses 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk,
     \[
     \text{Total ingredients} = 4 \times (3 + 1) = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of bags of flour needed:**
   - Each bag contains 2 cups.
   - To find out how many bags are needed for 16 cups,
     \[
     \text{Number of bags of flour} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ bags}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of bottles of milk needed:**
   - Each bottle contains 2 cups.
   - To find out how many bottles are needed for 16 cups,
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles of milk} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of bags of flour} - \text{Number of bottles of milk}
   \]
   Substituting the values obtained,
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 8 - 8 = 0
   \]

### Conclusion:
Mark has to buy an equal number of bags of flour and bottles of milk. Therefore, he does not need any additional bags of flour or bottles of milk beyond what he already has on hand.

**The final answer is:** 
\[

                    question:
                    Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by , 5 hours ? a ; day, how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total power consumption when using the AC:**
   - The AC has a power rating of 900 watts.
   - He uses the AC for 8 hours per day.
   
2. **Determine the daily electricity usage:**
   \[
   \text{Daily Electricity Usage} = \text{Power Rating} \times \text{Hours Used}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Daily Electricity Usage} = 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

3. **Convert the daily electricity usage to kilowatt-hours (kWh):**
   Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we can convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 3600:
   \[
   \text{Daily Electricity Usage (in kWh)} = \frac{\text{Daily Electricity Usage (in Wh)}}{3600}
   \]
   Substituting the value:
   \[
   \text{Daily Electricity Usage (in kWh)} = \frac{7200}{3600} = 2 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total savings if he reduces his use by 5 hours:**
   - His current usage is 8 hours/day.
   - Reducing it by 5 hours means he will only use AC for \(8 - 5 = 3\) hours/day.
   
5. **Calculate the new daily electricity usage:**
   \[
   \text{New Daily Electricity Usage} = \text{Power Rating} \times \text{Reduced Hours Used}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{New Daily Electricity Usage} = 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

6. **Convert the new daily electricity usage to kilowatt-hours:**
   Using the same conversion as before:
   \[
   \text{New Daily Electricity Usage (in kWh)} = \frac{2700}{3600} = 0.75 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

7. **Calculate the savings over 30 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Savings (in kWh)} = \text{Original Daily Usage (in kWh)} - \text{New Daily Usage (in kWh)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Savings (in kWh)} = 2 - 0.75 = 1.25 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

8. **Convert the total savings from kilowatt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**
   \[
   \text{Total Savings (in kW)} = \frac{\text{Total Savings (in kWh)}}{1000}
   \]
   Substituting the value:
   \[
   \text{Total Savings (in kW)} = \frac{1.25}{1000} = 0.00125 \, \text{kW}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of stripes for each zebra.
- Jane has three zebras.

#### Zebras with 17 stripes:
- Let's denote the total number of stripes as \( S \).

Given: 
\[ S = 17 \]

#### Zebras with 36 stripes:
- This zebra already has 36 stripes.

#### Zebra with half the number of stripes as the one with 36 stripes:
- The second zebra has half of 36 stripes.
\[ \text{Stripes} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of stripes across all zebras.
- We need to sum up the stripes from all zebras.

Total stripes:
\[ S_{total} = 17 + 36 + 18 \]

Calculate the total:
\[ S_{total} = 17 + 36 + 18 \]
\[ S_{total} = 71 \]

### Step 3: Find the average number of stripes per zebra.
- To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras (which is 3).
\[ \text{Average stripes} = \frac{S_{total}}{number\ of\ zebras} \]
\[ \text{Average stripes} = \frac{71}{3} \]

Perform the division:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many muffaletta sandwiches Tyson needs to make and then calculate the total cost based on the given information.

### Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed
Tyson wants to serve 20 people, and each sandwich serves 4 people. So, we divide the total number of people by the number of people served per sandwich:

\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{People per sandwich}} \]

\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Tyson needs to make **5 muffaletta sandwiches**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Since there are 5 sandwiches, we multiply the amount of meat needed for one sandwich by the number of sandwiches:

\[ \text{Meat needed (total)} = 5 \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} \]

\[ \text{Meat needed (total)} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of cheese needed:

\[ \text{Cheese needed (total)} = 5 \times 1 \text{ pound/sandwich} \]

\[ \text{Cheese needed (total)} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese
We know that the cost of meat is $7.00 per pound and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$7.00/\text{pound} \]

\[ \text{Cost of meat} = \$35.00 \]

Similarly,

\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} \]

\[ \text{Cost of cheese} = \$15.00 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Finally, we add the costs of the meat and cheese together to find out how much money Tyson will spend:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$35.00 + \$15.00 \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$50.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is **$50.00**.<|im_end|>","Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches

To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of corns and cannolis Allan has, then calculate the new quantities after he buys additional items.

1. **Initial Cannolis:**
   - Allan initially has 40 cannolis.
   
2. **Total Cannolis Including New Purchase:**
   - After buying 60 more cannolis,
     \[
     \text{New Total Cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100

3. **Corn Quantities:**
   - The problem states that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis.
   - Therefore, if he has 40 cannolis, he must have \(2 \times 40 = 80\) corns.

4. **Cannolis Bought (Additional):**

                    question:
                    : Elliott is trying to walk 10,000 steps . a : day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break down Elliott's journey into manageable parts and calculate each segment.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of steps Elliott aims to take.
Elliott aims to take **10,000 steps** in total.

### Step 2: Determine how many steps Elliott has already taken.
- On his walk to school and back, he took **5,000 steps** (half of his goal).
- After walking to school and back, he took an additional **1,000 steps** for a short walk.

So far, he has completed:
\[ 5,000 \text{ steps} + 1,000 \text{ steps} = 6,000 \text{ steps} \]

### Step 3: Subtract the completed steps from his goal to find out how many more steps he needs.
He still needs:
\[ 10,000 \text{ steps} - 6,000 \text{ steps} = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining steps after completing his walk to school and back.
After finishing his walk to school and back, he takes another **1,000 steps** for a short walk.

Now, we subtract these steps from the remaining steps needed:
\[ 4,000 \text{ steps} - 1,000 \text{ steps} = 3,000 \text{ steps} \]

### Step 5: Determine how many steps he walked for his short jog.
Since he still needs **3,000 steps** after his short walk, it means he walked for his short jog:
\[ 3,000 \text{ steps} \]

### Conclusion:
Elliott took **3,000 steps** during his short jog. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\]<|im_end|>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many minutes early Toby will be upon arriving at the airport, we need to calculate his total reading time based on the given word count and then compare it to the travel time.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book**

Given:
- The book is 45 pages long.
- Each page contains 200 words.

Total words = Number of pages * Words per page
= 45 pages * 200 words/page
= 9000 words

**Step 2: Determine Toby's reading speed**

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

**Step 3: Calculate the total reading time**

Reading time = Total words / Reading speed
= 9000 words / 300 words/minute
= 30 minutes

So, Toby needs 30 minutes to finish reading the book.

**Step 4: Compare the reading time to the travel time**

Travel time = 10 minutes (to the airport).

Since Toby needs 30 minutes to read the book and only 10 minutes for travel:

Time saved = Travel time - Reading time
= 10 minutes - 30 minutes
= -20 minutes

This negative value indicates that Toby would actually arrive later than expected due to the extended reading time. 

Therefore, Toby will not be able to reach the airport before his scheduled departure time. 

**Final Answer:** Toby will be late by **20 minutes**.<|im_end|>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5
It will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30
He will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40
He will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20

                    Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires on a contract basis. ? In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 , per hour for a 40-hour workweek.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to its employees over the two months (May and June), we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of hours worked by all employees in May.

- Number of employees hired in May = 40
- Hours worked per week = 40 hours
- Weeks in May = 4 weeks

Total hours worked in May:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment made in May.

- Hourly wage rate = $15 per hour

Total payment in May:
\[ \text{Total payment} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly wage} \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = (40 \times 40 \times 4) \times 15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of employees who had their contracts expire in June.

- Total employees hired in May = 40
- Employees whose contracts expired in June = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the number of employees still working in June.

- Employees still working in June = Total employees - Employees whose contracts expired in June
\[ \text{Employees still working in June} = 40 - \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \right) \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of hours worked by remaining employees in June.

- Remaining employees = 40 - (1/4 * 40)
- Hours worked per week = 40 hours

Total hours worked in June:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Remaining employees} \times \text{Hours per week} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total payment made in June.

- Hourly wage rate = $15 per hour

Total payment in June:
\[ \text{Total payment} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly wage} \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = \left[ \left( 40 - \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \right) \right) \times 40 \times 4 \right] \times 15 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the total payment for both months.

Total payment for both months:
\[ \text{Total payment} = (\text{Total payment in May}) + (\text{Total payment in June}) \]

Now let's perform the calculations:

#### Calculation for May:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 40 \times 40 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 6400 \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = 6400 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = 96000 \]

#### Calculation for June:
First, determine the number of employees still working in June:
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = 40 - \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \right) \]
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = 40 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = 30 \]

Next, calculate the total hours worked in June:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 30 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 1200 \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = 1200 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = 18000 \]

Finally, add the payments from both months:
\[ \text{Total payment} = 96000 + 18000 \]
\[ \text{Total payment} = 114000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to its employees in the two months is {The final answer is}: $114,000.<|im_end|>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many pounds of taffy Sally purchased.
- The trinket shop offers a deal where you can buy one pound of taffy and get another half-pound free if you spend more than $3.
- Sally buys 2 pounds of taffy.

Since Sally spends more than $3 (she gets 2 pounds + 1 pound = 3 pounds total), she qualifies for the free half-pound offer twice.

Total amount spent on taffy = $3 (first purchase) + $3 (second purchase) = $6

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the taffy.
- The price per pound of taffy is $3.
- Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.

Cost of taffy = $3/pound × 2 pounds = $6

### Step 3: Add the cost of the mixed bag of seashells.
- Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the items she bought.
- Cost of taffy = $6
- Cost of mixed bag of seashells = $1.50

Total cost = $6 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashell mix) = $7.50

### Step 5: Subtract the total cost from the initial amount given.
- Sally initially had $10.
- Total cost = $7.50

Money left = Initial amount - Total cost = $10 - $7.50 = $2.50

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} $2.50.<|im_end|>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks.
Tim buys a pack of fireworks worth $400.

- The second pack is worth twice as much as the first one.
\[ \text{Cost of second pack} = 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 20% discount to the first pack.
- The original price of the first pack is $400.
- A 20% discount means he pays 80% of the original price.
\[ \text{Discounted price of the first pack} = \$400 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$400 \times 0.80 = \$320 \]

### Step 3: Add the discounted price of the first pack and the cost of the second pack.
- Cost of the first pack after discount: $320
- Cost of the second pack: $800
\[ \text{Total cost before finale} = \$320 + \$800 = \$1120 \]

### Step 4: Add the cost of the finale.
- The finale costs $150.
\[ \text{Final total cost} = \$1120 + \$150 = \$1270 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is $\boxed{\$1270}$.<|im_end|>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many madeleine cookies Shannon consumes per day**
Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies per night.
There are 7 nights in a week (assuming she eats every night).
So, she consumes \(2 \times 7 = 14\) cookies per week.

**Step 2: Calculate how many madeleine cookies she needs for 30 days**
Since there are 7 days in a week, for 30 days she would consume:
\(14 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cookies}\).

**Step 3: Convert the number of cookies needed from daily consumption to total servings**
Her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies, which is equivalent to 12 cookies.
She needs 420 cookies in total.

**Step 4: Calculate how many dozen cookies she should make**
To find out how many dozen cookies she needs to make, divide the total number of cookies required by the number of cookies that one dozen represents:
\(\frac{420 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 35 \text{ dozen}\).

Therefore, Shannon needs to make **35 dozen** cookies to have enough for 30 days stored in the freezer.<|im_end|>","She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies

To determine how many candles Marcy will make that both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode.
2. Subtract this value from the total number of candles made.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of candles that will both smell like wet dog and explode**

- We know that 5% of the candles will have defects (both exploding and smelling like wet dog).
- Given that Marcy makes 50,000 candles, we can calculate the number of defective candles as follows:
\[ \text{Number of defective candles} = 5\% \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of defective candles} = 0.05 \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of defective candles} = 2,500 \]

So, **2,500 candles** will both smell like wet dog and explode.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of defective candles from the total number of candles made**

- The total number of candles made is 50,000.
- Subtracting the number of defective candles gives us the number of candles that do not meet either condition:
\[ \text{Number of non-defective candles} = 50,000 - 2,500 \]
\[ \text{Number of non-defective candles} = 47,500 \]

Therefore, **47,500 candles** will not only not explode but also not smell like wet dog.

**Final Answer:** 
{The final answer is} 47,500 candles.<|im_end|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount on one blouse:**
   - The original price of one blouse is $20.
   - The store offers a 30% discount on each blouse.
   
   To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of $20.

   \[
   \text{Discount per blouse} = 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the sale price after the discount:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the sale price.

   \[
   \text{Sale price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for all four blouses:**
   - Since Misha buys 4 blouses at the sale price, we multiply the sale price per blouse by 4.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $\boxed{56}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of apples collected by Joanne's sister:**

   - Joanne gathers 30 apples.
   - Her sister helps collect half of Joanne's amount from the tallest trees, so she collects \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.

   Therefore, the sister gathers \( 15 + 30 = 45 \) apples in total.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples collected by both sisters:**
   
   The sisters together have gathered 500 apples.

3. **Find out how many apples Joanne's sister collected from the shortest trees:**
   
   Since her sister has collected 45 apples in total and we know that she helped with the shortest trees, let's denote the number of apples collected from the shortest trees as \( x \). 

   So, \( x \) apples are collected from the shortest trees.

4. **Determine the number of apples collected from the average trees:**

   Since Joanne and her sister together have gathered 500 apples, and their sister collected 45 apples from the shortest trees (half of what Joanne collected), the remaining apples must be from the average trees. Let's denote the number of apples collected from the average trees as \( y \).

   From step 3, we know that the total number of apples is 500, and the sister collected 45 apples from the shortest trees. Therefore, the remaining apples (which are from the average trees) would be \( 500 - 45 = 455 \).

5. **Verify the distribution of apples between the two sisters:**

   - Joanne's sister collected 15 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, which sums up to \( 15 + 45 = 60 \).
   - The rest of the apples, 455, were collected from the average trees.

Therefore, Joanne's sister collected 15 apples from the tallest trees and 45 apples from the shortest trees, totaling 60 apples from the average trees.

**Final Answer:** Joanne's sister collected 60 apples from the average trees.<|im_end|>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of dromedaries.

Let's denote:
- \( C \) as the number of camels,
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Each camel has 2 humps.
2. Each dromedary has 1 hump.
3. The total number of heads (camels + dromedaries) is 180.
4. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304.

We can express these facts mathematically:
\[ H_{\text{heads}} = C + D \]
\[ B_{\text{bumps}} = 2C + D \]

Given that the total number of heads is 180, we have:
\[ C + D = 180 \tag{1} \]

And since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the total number of bumps is:
\[ 2C + D = 304 \tag{2} \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

First, let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

So, the number of camels (\( C \)) is 124. Now substitute \( C = 124 \) back into equation (1) to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the distances Tom traveled for each part of his trip.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 200 \times 4 = 800 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next two days:**
   - He traveled only 30% of the distance from the first 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

3. **Determine the distance Tom traveled on the last day:**
   - Since there was no travel mentioned for that day, we assume he didn't travel at all.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 0 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for 7 days.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 300 \times 7 = 2100 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

5. **Sum up all the distances:**
   - First 4 days: 800 km
   - Next two days: 240 km
   - Last day: 0 km
   - Second week: 2100 km
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\boxed{3140}<|im_end|>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Zack's locker.
2. Use the size of Zack's locker to determine the size of Timothy's locker.

Let's start with the given information about Peter's locker:

- Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of Zack's locker.
- Peter's locker has an area of 5 cubic inches.

From this, we can calculate Zack's locker size:

\[
\text{Zack's locker size} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker size}
\]

Substituting the value of Peter's locker into the equation:

\[
\text{Zack's locker size} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Now that we know Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, let's find out the size of Timothy's locker:

- Timothy's locker is half as big as Zack's locker.
- So, Timothy's locker size will be:

\[
\text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{\text{Zack's locker size}}{2}
\]

Substituting the value of Zack's locker into the equation:

\[
\text{Timothy's locker size} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Zack's locker is 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 cubic inches.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the elevation difference between Stanley and Oliver
Stanley is at 10,000 feet, while Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

Elevation difference = 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 feet

### Step 2: Calculate how much higher Stanley needs to go to reach Oliver's location
Since Stanley has already fallen 4,000 feet from where he started, we need to calculate the remaining distance for Oliver.

Remaining distance = 7,000 - 4,000 = 3,000 feet

Therefore, Oliver must climb **3,000 feet** to reach the same elevation as Stanley.

### Final Answer
Oliver must climb **3,000 feet** to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.<|im_end|>","The elevation of Stanley's comb was 10,000 - 4,000 = <<10000-4000=6000>>6,000 feet.

2. Add this amount to the initial capital.
3. Sum up all the amounts received.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money given by the second bank.
The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank. Since the first bank gave him $4000, the second bank gave him:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Step 2: Add the amounts from both banks to the initial capital.
Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Adding the amounts from both banks gives us:

2. **First boat trip**:
   - 4 boats arrived.
   - Each boat carries 5 cats.
   - Total cats carried away = \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Cats remaining after first trip: \(50 - 20 = 30\).

3. **Second boat trip**:
   - Now there are 30 cats left.
   - Again, 4 boats arrive.
   - Each boat carries 5 cats.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost over two years based on the different pricing tiers. Let's break down the costs step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 6 months.
- The first 6 months have a monthly fee of $8.

\[
\text{Cost for first 6 months} = 6 \times \$8 = \$48
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the next 3 months (months 7 and 8).
- After the initial 6 months, the price increases to $12 per month.

\[
\text{Cost for months 7 and 8} = 2 \times \$12 = \$24
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining months (month 9 onwards).
- After month 8, the price further increases to $14 per month.

Since the total time is 2 years, which is equivalent to 24 months, and we've already accounted for 10 months (first 6 + months 7 and 8), there are 14 more months left to be calculated at the higher rate.

\[
\text{Remaining months (months 9 onwards)} = 24 - 10 = 14 \text{ months}
\]
\[
\text{Cost for these 14 months} = 14 \times \$14 = \$196
\]

### Step 4: Sum all the costs together.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$48 (\text{first 6 months}) + \$24 (\text{months 7 and 8}) + \$196 (\text{remaining months})
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$48 + \$24 + \$196 = \$268
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is **$268**.<|im_end|>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the jogger jeans.
Given that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28:

\[ \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = \$28 - \$6 = \$22 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount saved.
Cole saved a total of $6 in total.

### Step 3: Determine how much Cole saved from the jogger jeans.
Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, let \( S_j \) be the total savings from the jogger jeans. We know that:

\[ S_j = \$6 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times \$6 = \$2 \]

This means Cole saved $2 from the jogger jeans.

### Step 4: Determine how much Cole saved from the tattered jeans.
Since the total savings from the tattered jeans plus the savings from the jogger jeans equals the total savings ($6), we can find the savings from the tattered jeans as follows:

Let \( S_t \) be the total savings from the tattered jeans. Then:

\[ S_t + \$2 = \$6 \]
\[ S_t = \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, Cole saved $4 from the tattered jeans.

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in original costs between the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans.
Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost compared to the tattered jeans, subtract the savings from the tattered jeans from the savings from the jogger jeans:

\[ \text{Difference} = \$22 - \$4 = \$18 \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $18 more than the tattered jeans.<|im_end|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.

Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

                    question:
                    The employees of Google went on a day trip. : 4 buses were rented that have the capacity of holding 60 employees. 6 minibusses that can hold , 30 employees, , and 10 minivans that can ? hold 15 ; employees. How : many employees can ? join : the . day trip?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many employees can join the day trip given the capacities of the buses, minibusses, and minivans.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the buses.
- There are 4 buses.
- Each bus has a capacity of 60 employees.
  
\[ \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the minibusses.
- There are 6 minibusses.
- Each minibuss has a capacity of 30 employees.

\[ \text{Total capacity of minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining capacity after accounting for the buses and minibusses.
Since the total number of employees who participated in the day trip was not provided, let's assume there were \( E \) employees originally planned for the trip.

\[ \text{Remaining capacity} = 240 + 180 - E \]

### Step 4: Calculate the capacity of the minivans.
- There is 1 van with a capacity of 15 employees.

\[ \text{Capacity of vans} = 15 \]

### Step 5: Combine all capacities to find out how many more employees can join.
Now, we add up all these capacities (buses, minibusses, and vans).

\[ \text{Total available capacity} = 240 + 180 + 15 \]

### Final Calculation:
\[ \text{Total available capacity} = 435 \]

Therefore, the total number of additional employees that can join the day trip is **435**.

This means if 435 more employees join the trip, they will be accommodated based on the existing vehicle capacities. If fewer than 435 employees plan to join, the trip might not fit their numbers perfectly due to space constraints.<|im_end|>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.
15 x 10 = <<15*10=150>>150 employees can ride on the minivans.
Therefore 240 + 180 + 150 = <<240+180+150=570>>570 employees can join the day trip.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Lillian's Garden Setup**:
   - She has built 3 bird feeders.
   - She bought 3 other bird feeders from the store.

2. **Bird Attraction per Feeder**:
   - The homemade feeders attract 20 birds per day.
   - The store-bought feeders attract 10 more birds than the homemade ones (i.e., 20 + 10 = 30 birds per day).

3. **Total Number of Birds at Feeders**:
   - Since both types of feeders attract their respective numbers of birds, we need to sum them up.

4. **Calculation**:
   - Homemade feeders: 3 feeders * 20 birds/feeder = 60 birds/day.
   - Store-bought feeders: 3 feeders * 30 birds/feeder = 90 birds/day.
   - Total number of birds attracted by all feeders combined: 60 + 90 = 150 birds/day.

Therefore, Lillian expects to see 150 birds in her garden each day if the same amount keeps coming to her bird feeders. 

{The final answer is} 150 birds.<|im_end|>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.

Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps.

1. **Calculate the cost of the soup:**
   - The bagel costs $4.
   - The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
   
   Let's denote the original cost of the bagel as \( B \).
   - Therefore, the cost of the soup \( S \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     S = B + 0.25B = 1.25B
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost before adding the cake:**
   - We know the bagel costs $4, so \( B = 4 \).
   - Substituting back into the equation for the soup:
     \[
     S = 1.25 \times 4 = 5
     \]
   - So, the soup costs $5.

3. **Calculate the cost of the cake:**
   - The cake is only half the price of the bagel.
   - Since the bagel costs $4, the cake \( C \) would be:
     \[
     C = \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]
   - So, the cake costs $2.

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on the meal:**
   - Adding up all the costs (bagel, soup, and cake):
     \[
     Total\ Cost = Bagel\ Cost + Soup\ Cost + Cake\ Cost = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
     \]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay a total of $11 for her dinner. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $11.<|im_end|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.

                    question:
                    Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park . with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon cards Kenny started with given that he plans to sell some of them at $1.5 each and use the remaining money to pay for a ticket to an amusement park.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine how much money Kenny will spend on the amusement park:**
   - The cost of the amusement park ticket is $100.
   - Kenny starts with $50 in spending cash.

2. **Calculate how much money Kenny will have left after buying the amusement park ticket:**
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Starting money} - \text{Cost of amusement park ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 100 = -50
   \]

Since it's not possible to have negative money, let's re-evaluate our approach. We realize that if Kenny spends all $50 on the amusement park ticket, he cannot afford any Pokémon cards because he needs more than $100 just for one card (since each card sells for $1.5).

Therefore, he can't afford any Pokémon cards with his current budget. 

Given the constraints, it seems there might be a mistake or misunderstanding in the problem statement. If the goal was to find out how many Pokémon cards he could buy, then he would indeed need more than $100 to cover the cost of the amusement park ticket alone. However, without additional information about how much extra money he has beyond what he uses for the amusement park ticket, we cannot accurately determine the number of Pokémon cards he started with based on the provided information.

**Final Answer:** 
Since the problem as stated does not allow for purchasing Pokémon cards due to the high cost of the amusement park ticket, the number of Pokémon cards Kenny started with cannot be determined from the given information.<|im_end|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of hotdogs needed if everyone got two:**
   - There were originally 36 guests.
   - Each guest should have received 2 hotdogs.
   - Total required = 36 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 72 hotdogs.

2. **Calculate how many hotdogs were actually provided:**
   - The caterer prepared enough for half of the original guests (18 guests).
   - Number of hotdogs prepared = 18 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 36 hotdogs.

3. **Compare the actual number of hotdogs prepared to the total needed:**
   - Original requirement: 72 hotdogs.
   - Prepared amount: 36 hotdogs.
   - Since 36 < 72, there isn't enough hotdogs.

4. **Adjust the number of hotdogs per guest based on the new scenario:**
   - Now, 40 guests showed up.
   - Everyone wants two hotdogs.
   - Total required = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

5. **Recalculate the number of hotdogs needed given the adjusted number of guests:**
   - Number of hotdogs needed now = 40 guests * 2 hotdogs/guest = 80 hotdogs.

6. **Determine how many additional hotdogs are needed beyond what was initially prepared:**
   - Initial preparation: 36 hotdogs.
   - Additional hotdogs needed = 80 hotdogs (required) - 36 hotdogs (prepared) = 44 hotdogs.

Therefore, the caterer needs an additional 44 hotdogs to ensure that all 40 guests receive at least two hotdogs.

**Final Answer:** 44 guests! did not get a second hotdog.<|im_end|>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
2. Apply the 20% discount to find the final amount.

Let's start with step one: calculating the total cost before the discount.

Step 1a: Calculate the cost of the pot and pans (set).
- Pot and pans = $120.00

Step 1b: Calculate the cost of the mixing bowls (individual item).
- Mixing bowls = $20.00

Step 1c: Calculate the cost of the 5 separate utensils (each $5.00).
- Utensils = 5 × $5.00 = $25.00

Now, let's add up all these costs to get the total cost before the discount.

Total cost before discount = Cost of pots and pans + Cost of mixing bowls + Cost of utensils
= $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
= $165.00

Next, let's move on to step two: applying the 20% discount.

Step 2a: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount = Total cost before discount × Discount rate
= $165.00 × 20%
= $33.00

Step 2b: Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount.

Final order amount = Total cost before discount - Discount
= $165.00 - $33.00
= $132.00

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much gas was in each container.
We start with 15 gallons of gas and divide it equally among 5 containers.

\[
\text{Gas per container} = \frac{\text{Total gas}}{\text{Number of containers}} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5}
\]

\[
\text{Gas per container} = 3 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much gas Josey needs.
Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Since each container holds 3 gallons, we calculate:

\[
\text{Gas for Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Container size} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons}
\]

\[
\text{Gas for Josey} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Convert gallons to pints.
There are 8 pints in a gallon (since 1 gallon = 8 pints).

\[
\text{Pints for Josey} = \text{Gallons for Josey} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon}
\]

\[
\text{Pints for Josey} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
First convert the fraction to a decimal or use the fact that dividing by 4 gives us half, so:

\[
\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now multiply by 8 pints per gallon:

\[
\text{Pints for Josey} = 0.75 \times 8
\]

\[
\text{Pints for Josey} = 6 \text{ pints}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ pints}}
\]<|im_end|>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container
(1/4)24 = 6 pints

                    The , vending machines sell chips for 40 cents and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had ! 1% of his money left. How many candy bars did he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much George spent on chips.
George bought 3 bags of chips at $5.

First, calculate the total cost of the chips:
\[
\text{Cost of chips} = \frac{\$5}{3}
\]

Calculate the exact amount:
\[
\text{Cost of chips} = \$1.\overline{666}_2
\]
This means George spent approximately $1.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying chips.
Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount George started with ($5):
\[
\$5 - \$1.\overline{666}_2 = \$3.33
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much George spent on candy bars.
We know that George has 1% of his original money left. So let's denote the total amount George initially had as \( T \). We know that 1% of \( T \) equals the remaining amount, which is $3.33.

So,
\[
0.01T = \$3.33
\]

Solve for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{\$3.33}{0.01} = \$333
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of candy bars George bought.
Each candy bar costs 75 cents or $0.75. To find out how many candy bars he bought, divide the total amount he spent on candies by the price per candy bar:
\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{T}{\$0.75}
\]

Substitute the value of \( T \):
\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{333}{0.75}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = 444
\]

Therefore, George bought **444** candy bars.<|im_end|>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05

1. **Determine how many lollipops Ray keeps:**
   - Ray starts with 25 lollipops.
   - He keeps 5 lollipops for himself.
   - Therefore, he keeps \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) lollipops.

2. **Calculate how many lollipops are left to be shared:**
   - After keeping 5 lollipops for himself, there are \( 25 - 5 = 20 \) lollipops remaining.

3. **Divide the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends:**
   - There are 20 lollipops left after keeping some for himself.
   - These 20 lollipops are divided equally among 4 friends.
   - So, each friend receives \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) lollipops.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final answer is {The final answer is}: 5.<|im_end|>","Ray shared a total of 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 lollipops.

To determine how much of the remaining cake weighs after Rory and her mom take their pieces, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total weight of the cake:**
   The cake weighs 20 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces each person gets:**
   Rory and her mom each get one piece from an eight-piece cake.
   
3. **Find out how many pieces are left:**
   Since there were originally 8 pieces and both Rory and her mom took one piece each, only 7 pieces remain.

4. **Determine the weight per piece:**
   We know that the entire cake (20 ounces) was cut into 8 equal pieces initially. Therefore, each piece weighs:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the remaining pieces:**
   Each of the remaining 7 pieces weighs 2.5 ounces. So, the total weight of the remaining cake is:
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges:**
   - Sitti bought 34 oranges.
   - Juris bought 22 oranges.
   - They decided to share these oranges equally among themselves plus some other friends.
   - The total number of people sharing the oranges includes both Sitti and Juris (let's call this number \( P \)).
   - We need to find out how many oranges each person gets in total.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges available:**
   - Sitti has 34 oranges.
   - Juris has 22 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges is \( 34 + 22 = 56 \).

3. **Determine the number of people sharing the oranges:**
   - Let \( P \) be the number of people sharing the oranges.
   - Since they want to share the oranges equally with their other friends, we can assume that there are more than just themselves and these friends (let's call the number of additional friends \( F \)).

4. **Set up an equation for the total number of oranges:**
   - Each person gets the same number of oranges from the total pool.
   - So, if each person gets \( x \) oranges, then the total number of oranges distributed is \( Px \).
   - This must equal the total number of oranges, which is 56.
   - Therefore, \( Px = 56 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - From \( Px = 56 \), we can see that \( x \) is the number of oranges each person gets.
   - To find \( x \), we divide 56 by \( P \):
     \[
     x = \frac{56}{P}
     \]

6. **Determine the value of \( P \):**
   - Since \( P \) represents the number of people sharing the oranges, and we don't have specific information about \( P \), we'll leave it as a variable for now.

7. **Calculate the number of oranges each person gets:**
   - Once \( P \) is known, we can substitute it into the equation \( x = \frac{56}{P} \) to find the exact number of oranges each person gets.

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer depends on the value of \( P \). Without knowing \( P \), we cannot determine the exact number of oranges each person gets.

Since the problem doesn't provide enough information to determine the number of people sharing the oranges (\( P \)), the final answer is:

\boxed{\text{The final answer is dependent on the value of } P.}<|im_end|>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

So, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of servings**: The recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. Since he doubles this amount, he will use \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds of onions.
2. **Cost of onions**: The onions are currently on sale for $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 4 pounds of onions is \(4 \times \$2.00 = \$8.00\).
3. **Number of servings**: The recipe serves 6 people.

Now, we can calculate the cost per serving:
- Cost per serving = Total cost / Number of servings = \(\frac{\$8.00}{6}\).

Let's perform the division:
\[ \frac{8}{6} = 1.3333... \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is approximately $1.33.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1.33}\).<|im_end|>","His recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions but he wants to double that amount so he needs 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 pounds of onions

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time difference between when Wayne and Bernadette will arrive at the theater.

1. **Determine the time for Wayne's trip:**
   - Wayne drives to the theater and it takes him 4 minutes.
   
2. **Calculate the time for Bernadette's trip:**
   - Bernadette's drive takes four times longer than Wayne's trip.
   - Since Wayne's trip takes 4 minutes, Bernadette's trip takes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

3. **Convert all times into the same unit (minutes):**
   - Wayne's trip: 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's trip: 16 minutes.

4. **Determine the time difference:**
   - Wayne leaves his hotel 4 minutes after the start of the event.
   - Bernadette needs to leave 16 minutes before the start of the event to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.

To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom given its area and one dimension (length). Here’s how we can do it:

1. **Convert the given dimensions into consistent units:**
   - We know that 1 yard = 3 feet.
   - Therefore, if the length of the room is 3 yards, then \(3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet}\).

2. **Calculate the width using the area formula:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by \( \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \).
   - Given the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can set up the equation as follows:
     \[
     360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Solving for the Width:
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter using the lengths found:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \( P = 2(\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     P = 2(9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet})
     \]
     \[
     P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet}
     \]
     \[

To determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads for each sister first.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of beads Elizabeth bought.
- Elizabeth bought:
  - 1 pack of red beads (which contains 20 beads)
  - 2 packs of clear beads (each containing 20 beads)

Let's add these up:

\[ \text{Total beads from red} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Total beads from clear} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of beads Margaret bought.
- Margaret bought:
  - 3 packs of blue beads (each containing 20 beads)
  - 4 packs of red beads (each containing 20 beads)

Again, let's add these up:

\[ \text{Total beads from blue} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
\[ \text{Total beads from red} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

So, the total number of beads Margaret bought is:

\[ 60 + 80 = 140 \]

### Step 3: Compare the total beads between the two sisters.
Now, we compare the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth has 60 beads.
Margaret has 140 beads.

### Step 4: Determine who has more beads.
Since 140 > 60, it means that Margaret has more beads than Elizabeth.

### Conclusion:
Margaret has **more** beads than Elizabeth.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Initial Temperature
- **Initial Temperature**: 40 degrees.

### Step 2: Baking Process
- **Duration of Baking**: 3 hours.
- **Temperature Increase per Hour**: 5 degrees.

First, calculate the total temperature increase during the baking process:
\[ \text{Total Temperature Increase} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, add this to the initial temperature:
\[ \text{Final Temperature After Baking} = 40 + 15 = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

### Step 3: Cooling Down from Baking
- **Cooling Rate**: 2 degrees per 10 minutes.

Calculate the cooling time after baking (in minutes):
\[ \text{Cooling Time} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, calculate how much the temperature decreases due to cooling:
\[ \text{Temperature Decrease Due to Cooling} = \frac{30}{10} \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtract this decrease from the temperature after baking:
\[ \text{Final Temperature After Cooling} = 55 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

### Step 4: Open Window Process
- **Duration of Opening Window**: 30 minutes.
- **Temperature Decrease per Minute**: 2 degrees.

Calculate the total temperature decrease due to opening the window:
\[ \text{Total Temperature Decrease Due to Window} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtract this decrease from the current temperature:
\[ \text{Final Temperature After Window Opening} = 49 - 60 = -11 \text{ degrees} \]

Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

                    question:
                    Jon runs a : triathlon. ;  It takes him ? 40 minutes for ? the swim, an ; hour . and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time taken by James for each part of his triathlon and then calculate the total time he took.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert all times to minutes:**
   - Jon's total time: \(40 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}\)
   - James' total time: \(10\%\) faster in the swim → \(90\%\) of the time Jon swam.
     \[
     \text{James' Swim Time} = 0.9 \times 40 = 36 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - James takes \(5 \text{ minutes}\) longer on the bike than Jon.
     \[
     \text{James' Bike Time} = 60 + 5 = 65 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining time for the run:**
   - The difference between Jon's and James' run times is \(10 \text{ minutes}\).
     \[
     \text{James' Run Time} = 150 \text{ minutes} - (36 \text{ minutes} + 65 \text{ minutes}) = 49 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer:
James took \(49\) minutes to complete the run. Thus, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes
So his total time was 40+80+50=<<40+80+50=170>>170 minutes
James finished the swim 40*.1=<<40*.1=4>>4 minutes faster
So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long Movie A is, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes.
Movie C is given as 1.25 hours.

First, convert this into minutes:
\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

### Step 2: Determine the length of Movie B based on the information that it is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:
\[ 75 \text{ minutes (Movie C)} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

### Step 3: Calculate the length of Movie A using the fact that it is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
Given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The length of Movie A is **20 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = <<75+5=80>>80 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance the horse can run in 30 minutes.
2. Determine how many bails of hay the horse will eat based on the distance it can run.
3. Calculate the total cost of the hay.
4. Determine if Michael has enough money to buy the required amount of hay.
5. Calculate the remaining money after buying the hay.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse can run in 30 minutes.
- The speed of the horse is 32 miles per hour (mph).
- Time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 32 mph × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

Step 2: Determine how many bails of hay the horse will eat.
- For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- Total bails eaten = 16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay.
- Each bail costs $3.
- Total cost = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24.

Step 4: Determine if Michael has enough money to buy the required amount of hay.
- Michael has six $5 bills, so he has a total of $30.
- Cost of hay = $24.
- Money left after buying hay = $30 - $24 = $6.

Therefore, after buying the hay, Michael will have $6 in change.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs:**
   - Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, 4 dozen equals \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs.

2. **Add the loose eggs:**
   - She also has 2 eggs that are loose in the cupboard.
   - So, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\).

3. **Determine the number of eggs needed per tray:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.
   - Therefore, each tray will need \(5 \text{ glasses} \times 5 \text{ eggs/glass} = 25 \text{ eggs}\).

4. **Calculate the number of trays needed:**
   - To find out how many trays she can put out, divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.
   - The calculation is \(50 \div 25 = 2\).

Therefore, Rozanne can put out **2** trays of eggnog.<|im_end|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.

So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many points Joey is winning after Marcy's score, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Points**: Joey starts with 214 points.
2. **Joey's Score**: Joey scores an additional 26 points. So, we add these to his initial points: 
   \[
   214 + 26 = 240
   \]
   Now Joey has 240 points.

3. **Marcy's Initial Points**: Marcy starts with 225 points.
4. **Marcy's Score**: Marcy then scores 10 more points. So, we add these to her initial points:
   \[
   225 + 10 = 235
   \]
   Now Marcy has 235 points.

5. **Comparison**: To find out how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's total from Joey's current total:
   \[
   240 - 235 = 5
   \]

Therefore, Joey is currently winning by 5 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost per Sneaker
First, we need to find out how much the salesman spent on buying the sneakers.

- Total cost = $576
- Number of sneakers = 48

Cost per sneaker = Total cost / Number of sneakers
= $576 / 48
= $12

### Step 2: Calculate Sales from Flash Sale
Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the sneakers during the flash sale.

Number of sneakers sold during the flash sale = 17
Price per sneaker (flash sale) = $20

Revenue from flash sale = Number of sneakers × Price per sneaker
= 17 × $20
= $340

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Sneakers Sold
We know that the salesman has 48 sneakers in total. Out of these, he sold 17 during the flash sale. Therefore, the number of remaining sneakers is:

Remaining sneakers = Total sneakers - Sneakers sold during flash sale
= 48 - 17
= 31

### Step 4: Calculate Revenue from Department Store Sales
Now, we'll calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store.

Number of sneakers sold to the department store = Remaining sneakers
= 31

Price per sneaker (department store) = $25

Revenue from department store sales = Number of sneakers × Price per sneaker
= 31 × $25
= $775

### Step 5: Calculate Total Revenue
Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store sales
= $340 + $775
= $1115

### Step 6: Calculate Profit
Finally, we subtract the initial investment from the total revenue to get the profit.

Profit = Total revenue - Initial investment
= $1115 - $576
= $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.<|im_end|>","The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.

In total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of color packs that Beatrice purchased and then determine how many individual colors she has.

1. **Calculate the total number of packs:**
   - Six of the ten packets have eight colors.
   - The remaining four packets have sixteen colors.

2. **Sum up the total number of color packs:**

\[
6 \text{ (six-pack)} + 4 \text{ (four-pack)} = 10 \text{ (total packs)}
\]

3. **Determine the total number of colors:**
   - Each six-pack contains \(8\) colors per packet.
   - Each four-pack contains \(16\) colors per packet.

Let's calculate:

- For the six-packs:
\[
6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ colors}
\]

- For the four-packs:
\[
4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ colors}
\]

Now, add these together to get the total number of colors:

\[
48 + 64 = 112 \text{ colors}

To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's break down the given information and solve it step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Super Ticket Offer
- **Super Ticket Cost**: $20 (includes all movies)
- **Regular Movie Ticket Cost**: $12
- **Additional Items**:
    - Popcorn + Soda = Regular Price
    - Additional cost for popcorn + soda = $1 extra per item

### Step 2: Calculate Total Savings from the Super Ticket Offer
- If you bought the super ticket instead of buying individual tickets and items separately, you saved $2.
  
### Step 3: Determine the Total Amount Saved
- Let \( P \) be the regular price of popcorn.
- The total savings from the super ticket offer is $2.

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
- The total savings should equal the difference between the super ticket cost and the sum of the regular ticket cost and the additional items' cost.
\[ 20 = 12 + (P + 3) \]

### Step 5: Simplify the Equation
\[ 20 = 12 + P + 3 \]
\[ 20 = 15 + P \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( P \)
\[ P = 20 - 15 \]
\[ P = 5 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial cost per balloon
Given that the total cost for 20 balloons on one day is $900, we can calculate the initial cost per balloon.

\[
\text{Initial Cost per Balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20}
\]

\[
\text{Initial Cost per Balloon} = \$45
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the increase
After two days, the cost of filling each balloon increases by $20. So, we add $20 to the initial cost per balloon.

\[
\text{New Cost per Balloon} = \$45 + \$20
\]

\[
\text{New Cost per Balloon} = \$65
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price
Now, we need to find out how much Bentley would pay to fill 170 balloons at the new price.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Balloons} \times \text{New Cost per Balloon}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 170 \times \$65
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$11,050

                    question:
                    Jenna starts ! out , with 8 sapphires. She trades ? 3 ; sapphires for two rubies. If sapphires are worth $800 and rubies are worth $1200, how much money are all her jewels worth?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of sapphires traded.
Jenna initially has 8 sapphires. She trades away 3 sapphires.

\[ \text{Remaining sapphires} = 8 - 3 = 5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the sapphires traded.
Each sapphire is worth $800.

\[ \text{Value of traded sapphires} = 3 \times 800 = \$2400 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the value of the sapphires remaining.
Jenna still has 5 sapphires left.

\[ \text{Value of remaining sapphires} = 5 \times 800 = \$4000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total value of the remaining jewels.
Jenna will receive 2 rubies in exchange for the sapphires she gives away. Each ruby is worth $1200.

\[ \text{Value of received rubies} = 2 \times 1200 = \$2400 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total value of the remaining sapphires.
Since Jenna keeps the sapphires after the trade, we don't need to add them to the total because they are not included in the trade.

### Step 6: Add up the values of all remaining jewels.
- Remaining sapphires: $4000
- Received rubies: $2400

Total value of all remaining jewels:

\[ \text{Total value} = 4000 + 2400 = \$6400 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total value of all Jenna's remaining jewels is **$6400**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

Then find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400
Then amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine how many apples Marin eats per day.
   - Marin eats 4 apples a day.

2. Determine how many apples Nancy eats per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.

3. Calculate their combined daily apple consumption.
   - Since both Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples a day, together they consume \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples per day.

4. Calculate the total number of apples consumed over 30 days.
   - To find out how many apples they eat together in 30 days, multiply their daily consumption (8 apples) by the number of days (30).
     \[ 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

5. Verify that both individuals contribute equally to the total.
   - Each person contributes 4 apples per day, so in 30 days, each will have eaten \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples.
   - This confirms our calculation is correct since \(120 + 120 = 240\).

                    question:
                    Bob needs to buy potting ! soil , to fill the raised beds in : his vegetable garden. He has 10 raised ! beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. ; Each bag of potting soil : holds 2 ! cubic feet of soil : and costs $12. , How much will ; the potting soil cost him?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much potting soil Bob will need for his raised beds, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
Each raised bed is described as being 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall.

Volume of one raised bed = Width × Length × Height
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total volume needed for all raised beds.
Bob has 10 raised beds, so we multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of raised beds.
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \text{ cubic feet/bed} \times 10 \text{ beds} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of potting soil required.
Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total volume by the volume per bag.
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Volume per Bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320}{2} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = 160 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the potting soil.
Each bag costs $12. Therefore, to find the total cost, multiply the number of bags by the price per bag.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bags} \times \text{Cost per Bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$1920 \]

### Final Answer:
The potting soil will cost Bob $1920.<|im_end|>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know that the number of green cards is 60% greater than the number of red cards.
   - The number of red cards is given as 15.
   - To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15.

\[
\text{Number of green cards} = 15 \times \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) = 15 \times 0.6 = 9
\]

2. **Calculate the total number of yellow cards:**
   - The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.
   - From Step 1, we have 15 red cards and 9 green cards.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:

\[
\text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
\]

3. **Summarize the total number of all mentioned colors:**
   - Now we add up all the cards (red, green, and yellow).
   - Red cards: 15
   - Green cards: 9
   - Yellow cards: 24

\[
\text{Total number of cards} = 15 (\text{Red}) + 9 (\text{Green}) + 24 (\text{Yellow})
\]

\[
\text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 9 + 24 = 48

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of fairies:**
   - Katelyn initially sees 50 fairies.

2. **Fairies joining from the east:**
   - One friend joins after 20 minutes.
   - This friend sees half as many fairies as Katelyn did.
     \[
     \text{Number of fairies seen by the friend} = \frac{50}{2} = 25

   - So, the total number of fairies after 20 minutes is:
     \[
     50 + 25 = 75
     \]

3. **Fairies leaving after ten minutes:**
   - After 10 more minutes (total time), 30 fairies leave.
   - The total number of fairies at this point would be:
     \[
     75 - 30 = 45

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed.
- **Hay**: The farmer buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds.
  \[
  42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
  \]
  
- **Oats**: The farmer buys 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
  \[
  20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Carrots**: The farmer buys 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
  \[
  4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Sugar Cakes**: The farmer buys 2 boxes, each weighing 1 pound.
  \[
  2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total weight of all feeds.
\[
3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4598 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many trips are needed to transport all the feed.
Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds per trip, we divide the total weight (4598 pounds) by the capacity of the truck (2250 pounds).
\[
\frac{4598}{2250} \approx 2.047 \text{ trips}
\]

### Step 4: Round up to ensure all feed is transported.
Since the farmer cannot make a partial trip, we round up to the nearest whole number.
\[
\lceil 2.047 \rceil = 3
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs 3 trips to transport all the feed.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 3 trips.<|im_end|>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling over a four-week period, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of one aluminum can.
2. Calculate the total value of the aluminum cans she consumes.
3. Calculate the value of one plastic bottle.
4. Calculate the total value of the plastic bottles she consumes.
5. Sum the values from step 2 and step 4 to find her total earnings.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Value of One Aluminum Can
An aluminum can is worth 2 cents.

### Step 2: Total Value of the Aluminum Cans Consumed
Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans per week. Therefore, the total value from the aluminum cans consumed in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

### Step 3: Value of One Plastic Bottle
A plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.

### Step 4: Total Value of the Plastic Bottles Consumed
Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles per week. Therefore, the total value from the plastic bottles consumed in a week is:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

### Step 5: Total Earnings Over Four Weeks
Now, we sum up the weekly earnings from both types of containers:
- Weekly earnings from aluminum cans: 6 cents
- Weekly earnings from plastic bottles: 15 cents

Total earnings in a week:
\[ 6 \text{ cents (aluminum)} + 15 \text{ cents (plastic)} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total earnings over four weeks are:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Grayson earns \( \boxed{84} \) cents from recycling in a four-week month.<|im_end|>","Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.

To determine how many plants Shondra has, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants Frederick has.
Frederick has 10 plants.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants Toni has based on Frederick's count.
Since Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Toni's plants} = \text{Number of Frederick's plants} + (\text{Number of Frederick's plants} \times 0.6) \]

Substitute Frederick's number into the equation:
\[ \text{Number of Toni's plants} = 10 + (10 \times 0.6) \]
\[ \text{Number of Toni's plants} = 10 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of Toni's plants} = 16 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Shondra has based on Toni's count.
Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so:
\[ \text{Number of Shondra's plants} = \text{Number of Toni's plants} - 7 \]

Substitute Toni's number into the equation:
\[ \text{Number of Shondra's plants} = 16 - 7 \]
\[ \text{Number of Shondra's plants} = 9 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Leila gives to Ali.
2. Calculate the new amount of money Ali has after receiving the money from Leila.

Let's start with step 1:

Step 1: Calculate how much money Leila gives to Ali.
- Leila has $100.
- She gives Ali half of her money.
\[ \text{Money given by Leila} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$100 = \$50 \]

Now, let's move on to step 2:

Step 2: Calculate the new amount of money Ali has after receiving the money from Leila.
- Initially, Ali had $21.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students Miss Maria can give away her cards to after keeping some for herself.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards:**
   - Miss Maria has six decks.
   - Each deck contains 25 basketball cards.
   \[
   \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards:**
   - Miss Maria has five boxes.
   - Each box contains 40 baseball cards.
   \[
   \text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 40 = 200
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of cards before giving any away:**
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Basketball cards} + \text{Baseball cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of cards Miss Maria keeps from the total number of cards:**
   \[
   \text{Cards given away} = 350 - 50 = 300
   \]

5. **Divide the number of cards given away by the number of cards per student (since she gives them to ten students):**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = \frac{\text{Cards given away}}{\text{Cards per student}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = \frac{300}{10} = 30
   \]

### Final Answer:
Miss Maria has \(\boxed{30}\) students.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.
And, there are 5 x 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.
Thus, Miss Maria has 150 + 200 = <<150+200=350>>350 sports cards.
She gave a total of 350 - 50 = <<350-50=300>>300 cards to her students.
Therefore, Miss Maria has 300/10 = <<300/10=30>>30 students.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought : 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How much more did Kelly pay than Becky?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate their individual costs after applying their respective discounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Becky's Purchase:**
1. **Calculate the total cost without any discount:**
   - Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 20 \times 45 \text{ cents}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 900 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Apply the $1 discount:**
   - The total cost after applying the discount is reduced by $1 (since it was already applied in the problem statement).
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 900 \text{ cents} - 100 \text{ cents}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 800 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Convert the final cost back to dollars:**
   - Since 100 cents equal $1,
   \[
   \text{Final Cost in Dollars} = \frac{800}{100} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

#### **Kelly's Purchase:**
1. **Calculate the total cost before the discount:**
   - Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 20 \times 50 \text{ cents}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 1000 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **Apply the 10% discount:**
   - A 10% discount on $100 means she pays 90% of that amount.
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \text{ cents} \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Calculate the final cost after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 1000 \text{ cents} - 10 \text{ cents}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 990 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Convert the final cost back to dollars:**
   - Since 100 cents equal $1,
   \[
   \text{Final Cost in Dollars} = \frac{990}{100} = 9.90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Comparison:
- Becky's final cost: $8.00
- Kelly's final cost: $9.90

**Difference in cost between Kelly and Becky:**
\[
\text{Difference} = 9.90 \text{ dollars} - 8.00 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 1.90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Kelly paid $\boxed{1.90}$ more than Becky.<|im_end|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different types of laundry items per room and then calculate the total amount of laundry for all rooms.

1. **Identify the number of sheets per room:**
   - Each room has 2 sheets.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of sheets across all rooms:**
   - Number of rooms = 80
   - Sheets per room = 2
   - Total sheets = 80 * 2 = 160 sheets
   
3. **Identify the number of pillow cases per room:**
   - There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets.
   - Pillow cases per room = 2 * sheets = 2 * 2 = 4 pillow cases
   
4. **Calculate the total number of pillow cases across all rooms:**
   - Number of rooms = 80
   - Pillow cases per room = 4
   - Total pillow cases = 80 * 4 = 320 pillow cases
   
5. **Identify the number of comforters per room:**
   - There are no comforters mentioned for each room, so let's assume there are none (though not specified).
   
6. **Identify the number of towels per room:**
   - There are twice as many towels as pillow cases.
   - Towels per room = 2 * pillow cases = 2 * 4 = 8 towels
   
7. **Calculate the total number of towels across all rooms:**
   - Number of rooms = 80
   - Towels per room = 8
   - Total towels = 80 * 8 = 640 towels
   
8. **Sum up the total number of laundry items:**
   - Sheets = 160
   - Pillow cases = 320
   - Comforters = 0
   - Towels = 640
   - Total laundry items = 160 + 320 + 0 + 640 = 1120 pieces of laundry

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of shoes Frank starts with.
Frank initially has 200 shoes.

### Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of shoes Frank adds over time.
- On Monday, Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes.
- On Wednesday, Frank gets 15 new pairs of shoes.
- On Friday, Frank gets 30 new pairs of shoes.

First, calculate the total number of pairs added:
\[ \text{Total pairs added} = 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, convert these pairs into individual shoes:
\[ \text{Shoes from pairs} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

### Step 3: Add the shoes Frank already had to those gained in pairs.
\[ \text{Total shoes after adding pairs} = 200 + 100 = 300 \]

### Step 4: Account for the shoes Frank gives away on Saturday.
Frank gives away 180 shoes on Saturday.

### Step 5: Subtract the shoes given away on Saturday from the total.
\[ \text{Final shoe count} = 300 - 180 = 120 \]

### Conclusion:
After considering all additions and subtractions, Frank will have **120 shoes** on Sunday. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

To determine how many pans of cupcakes Mary should bake, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated with the sprinkles:**
   - Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles.
   - Each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes.
   
   Therefore, the total number of cupcakes that can be decorated is calculated as follows:

- The pen costs $2.
- The paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen.

First, calculate three times the price of the pen:
\[ 3 \times \$2 = \$6 \]

Next, subtract $1 from that amount to find the cost of the paper:

So, the paper costs $5.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
Now, add the cost of the pen and the paper together:
\[ \$2 + \$5 = \$7 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount given
The cashier gives Theo $10.

2. Determine how many pencils were used after two months.
3. Find out how many pencils remain after two months.
4. Calculate how many pencils were used at the end of the year.
5. Determine how many pencils remain at the end of the year.

**Step 1: Initial Number of Pencils**

There are 30 students, and each student starts with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils initially is:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

**Step 2: Pencils Used After Two Months**

According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils are used after two months. So, the number of pencils used after two months is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

**Step 3: Remaining Pencils After Two Months**

Subtracting the used pencils from the initial total gives us the remaining pencils:
\[ 300 - 60 = 240 \]

**Step 4: Pencils Used at the End of the Year**

At the end of the year, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils are used. So, the number of pencils used at the end of the year is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

**Step 5: Remaining Pencils at the End of the Year**

Subtracting the used pencils from the remaining pencils after two months gives us the final number of pencils left:
\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils that were left at the end of the year is:

                    question:
                    : Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him ! to . eat healthily. : He tells Matt he can have half ; as many : cookies as . the number of carrot sticks he ! eats, plus ? two extra for . cleaning his , room.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies Matt wants:**
   - Matt wants 5 cookies.

2. **Understand the conditions for eating carrots:**
   - The condition states that Matt should eat half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
   - Additionally, he should eat 2 more extra cookies.

3. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
   According to the conditions:
   - Half as many cookies as carrot sticks: \( \frac{C}{2} \)
   - Plus 2 extra cookies: \( \frac{C}{2} + 2 \)

4. **Combine these into an equation for the total number of cookies:**
   The total number of cookies Matt will eat is equal to the sum of the above two expressions:
   \[
   \frac{C}{2} + \left( \frac{C}{2} + 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{C}{2} + \frac{C}{2} + 2 = 5
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   \frac{C}{2} + \frac{C}{2} + 2 = 5
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   C + 2 = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( C \):**
   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   C = 5 - 2
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   C = 3
   \]

**Conclusion:**
Matt needs to eat 3 carrot sticks to satisfy all the conditions set by his dad.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 3 carrot sticks.<|im_end|>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3
Then double the number of cookies to find how many carrots sticks he has to eat: 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6.

                    question:
                    Benny saw a 10-foot ; shark with 2 6-inch . remoras attached to it. , What percentage of ! the shark's body : length is the combined length , of : the remoras?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit.
We will convert everything to feet.

- The length of the shark is already given in feet: \(10\) feet.
- The length of the first remora is given as \(2\) inches.
- We know that \(1\) foot = \(12\) inches, so:
  \[
  2 \text{ inches} = \frac{2}{12} \text{ feet} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet}
  \]
  
### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras.
The two remoras have lengths of \(2\) inches and \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet respectively. Adding them together gives us the total length of the remoras:
\[
\frac{1}{6} + 2 = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{12}{6} = \frac{13}{6} \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the fraction of the shark’s body length occupied by the remoras.
The total length of the shark is \(10\) feet. To find the fraction, divide the total length of the remoras by the total length of the shark:
\[
\frac{\frac{13}{6}}{10} = \frac{13}{6} \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{13}{60} \text{ (as a fraction)}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the fraction to a decimal or percentage.
First, convert \(\frac{13}{60}\) to a decimal:
\[
\frac{13}{60} \approx 0.2167
\]

Next, convert this decimal to a percentage by multiplying by \(100\):
\[
0.2167 \times 100 \approx 21.67\%
\]

### Conclusion:
The combined length of the remoras is approximately \(21.67\%\) of the shark's body length.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21.67\%}
\]<|im_end|>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches

Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

2. **Understand the given information:**
   - Three-fourths (or 75%) of the students have a desktop computer.
   - This means one-fourth (or 25%) of the students do not have a desktop computer.

3. **Set up an equation based on the given percentages:**
   Since 25% of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can write:
   \[
   0.25N = 20

4. **Solve for \( N \):**
   To find \( N \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.25:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total time available for walking:**
   - Jason has three weeks to prepare.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

2. **Calculate the number of days Jason will be able to walk per week:**
   - He walks 4 days a week.

3. **Calculate the total number of days he will be able to walk over three weeks:**
   - \( 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \)

4. **Determine the time required to break in the shoes:**
   - According to the information provided, it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the shoes.

5. **Convert the total time required from minutes to hours (since we usually measure time in hours):**
   - \( 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \)

6. **Calculate the average amount of time Jason should spend walking each day:**
   - To find out how many hours he needs to walk each day, divide the total hours by the number of days he can walk per week.
   - \( \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour/day} \approx 0.333 \text{ hours/day} \)

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total cost per book.
Sarah spent a total of $300 on books, and each book costs $15.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$300 \\
\text{Cost per Book} = \$15
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of books purchased.
To find out how many books Sarah bought in total, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book.

\[
\text{Number of Books} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Cost per Book}} \\
= \frac{300}{15}
\]

\[
\text{Number of Books} = 20
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many books were given to each child.
Sarah has 4 children, and she wants to give them an equal number of books.

\[
\text{Books per Child} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Books}}{\text{Number of Children}}
\]

\[
\text{Books per Child} = \frac{20}{4}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Define the Sets:**
   - Let \( A \) be the set of kids who are allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of kids who are allergic to peanuts.
   
   From the problem statement:
   - \( |A| = 9 \)
   - \( |B| = 6 \)
   - \( |A \cap B| = 3 \)

2. **Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   The number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts (or both) can be found using the formula for the union of two sets:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Kids Not Allergic to Anything:**
   Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids not allergic to anything is:
   \[
   32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip based on the given information.

### Step 1: Calculate the normal daily cost at the hotel
- Normal price per day at the hotel = $1500

### Step 2: Calculate the increased daily cost due to the busy weekend
- Increased daily cost = 20% more than the normal price
- Increase amount = 20% of $1500
\[ \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 1500 = \$300 \]

- Therefore, the increased daily cost = $1500 + $300 = $1800

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 3 days at the hotel
- Number of days = 3
- Cost per day = $1800
- Total cost for 3 days = $1800 × 3 = $5400

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the plane tickets
- Plane tickets cost $5000 each.
- Since he buys two tickets (one for him and one for his wife),
- Total cost for plane tickets = $5000 × 2 = $10,000

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the trip
- Cost of the trip = Cost at hotel × Number of days + Cost of plane tickets
- Cost of the trip = ($5400 × 3) + $10,000 = $16,200 + $10,000 = $26,200

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight of the 2010 penny.
2. Add the weights of both pennies together.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny.
- We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
- The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

Let's denote the weight of the 2010 penny as \( W_{2010} \).

Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the 1959 penny’s weight, we can write:
\[ W_{2010} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

Now let's calculate it:
\[ W_{2010} = \frac{3 \times 48}{4} \]
\[ W_{2010} = \frac{144}{4} \]
\[ W_{2010} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Step 2: Add the weights of both pennies.
- The weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains.
- The weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total amount raised so far:**
   - Keegan has earned $83.
   - Tasha has earned $91.
   
   Total raised = Keegan's earnings + Tasha's earnings
                  = $83 + $91
                  = $174

2. **Determine how much more they need to raise to reach their goal:**
   - Their goal is to raise $200.
   - They have already raised $174.

   Amount still needed = Goal - Total raised
                        = $200 - $174
                        = $26

Therefore, they still need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.

1. **Determine the total number of songs in Gabriel's player:**
   - Gabriel's player can store up to 100 songs.
   - Gabriel currently has 20 songs.

2. **Calculate how many more songs Luri needs to reach 100 songs:**
   - Since Gabriel already has 20 songs, he has \(100 - 20 = 80\) more songs needed for his player.
   
3. **Calculate how many songs Luri already has:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many oranges Stetson ate.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up based on the number of oranges eaten.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Determine how many oranges Stetson ate
Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked. The total number of oranges picked was 60.

\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Number of oranges Stetson ate} = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up
Stetson gives away $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, if he ate 24 oranges, the total amount given up can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is **$240**.<|im_end|>","If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.

To determine how long James runs in total over the course of a week, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance James runs in one day**
James runs 12 miles per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week**
Since James runs every day for 5 days a week, we multiply his daily running distance by 5.

\[ \text{Total weekly distance} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} \]

\[ \text{Total weekly distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to run this distance at a speed of 10 miles/hour**
We know that distance equals speed multiplied by time (D = S × T). Rearranging this formula to solve for time gives us \( T = \frac{D}{S}\).

Let's substitute our values into this equation:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Total weekly distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ T = \frac{60 \, \text{miles/week}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} \]

\[ T = 6 \, \text{hours/week} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of oats needed per meal:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - There are four horses.

2. **Calculate the daily oat consumption for all horses:**
   \[
   \text{Daily oats consumption} = \text{Number of horses} \times \text{Oats per meal per horse}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranians:**
   - We know that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - The total number of puppies is 27.

Let \( P \) represent the total number of Pomeranians.

\[
P = \frac{2}{3} \times 27

So, there are 18 Pomeranians in total.

2. **Determine the number of Pomeranian girls:**
   - One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.

Since there are 18 Pomeranians in total, we can find the number of Pomeranian girls using:

\[
G = \frac{1}{3} \times 18

Calculate \( G \):

\[
G = \frac{1 \times 18}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6

<|im_start|>user
To find the average highest temperature among the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Sum up all the temperatures.
First, let's add up all the highest recorded temperatures from the three countries.

- Highest temperature in Southlandia: \(-48\) degrees Fahrenheit
- Highest temperature in Northlandia: \(21\) degrees Fahrenheit
- Highest temperature in Midlandia: \(-3\) degrees Fahrenheit

Now, summing these values:

\[
-48 + 21 + (-3)
\]

Calculate the sum:

\[
-48 + 21 = -27
\]
\[
-27 + (-3) = -30
\]

So, the total sum of the highest temperatures is \(-30\) degrees Fahrenheit.

### Step 2: Divide the total sum by the number of countries.
There are three countries (Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia).

We now divide the total sum by the number of countries to find the average temperature.

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{\text{Total sum}}{\text{Number of countries}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{-30}{3}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{-30}{3} = -10

To determine the total cost per individual razor after the discount, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Determine the number of razors in one pack:**
   - Heather's razors come in packs that contain 4 razors.

2. **Calculate the cost without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Since there are 4 razors per pack, the cost per razor would be $\frac{4}{4} = \$1.00$.

3. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:**
   - If she buys one pack, she gets another one free. So, she effectively pays for only one pack.
   - The cost of one pack remains $4.00.

4. **Subtract the coupon value:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract this from the total cost of buying two packs ($4.00).
   - After applying the coupon, her total cost becomes $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

5. **Divide the total cost by the number of razors:**
   - Now, she has bought two packs (8 razors) at a total cost of $2.00.
   - To find the cost per individual razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors: 
     \[
     \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{2.00}{8}
     \]

6. **Simplify the division:**
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{2.00}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Convert dollars to cents:

                    question:
                    9 out of , 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall.  The 10th , cheerleader is 60"" tall.  If they build a human ; pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom, .  3 ; stand : on top of the 4, 2 ? stand on ! top of the 3 and the shortest girl ; is at ? the top, how tall is , the : human pyramid , in ! feet?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the height distribution among the cheerleaders.
Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, we can assume all cheerleaders have heights between 64 inches (minimum) and 64 inches (maximum).

### Step 2: Identify the height of the 10th cheerleader.
The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cheerleaders.
There are 10 cheerleaders in total.

### Step 4: Determine the arrangement for the human pyramid.
- **Bottom layer**: 4 girls standing together.
- **Top layer**: 3 girls standing together.
- **Second top layer**: 2 girls standing together.
- **Shortest girl** stands on top.

### Step 5: Calculate the height contribution from the bottom layer.
Since there are 4 girls in the bottom layer and each has a height of 64 inches:
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the height contribution from the middle layer.
Similarly, since there are 3 girls in the middle layer and each has a height of 64 inches:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 7: Calculate the height contribution from the top layer.
Finally, since there are 2 girls in the top layer and each has a height of 64 inches:
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 8: Determine the height of the smallest girl.
We know that the tallest girl (64 inches) is part of the bottom layer. Therefore, she cannot be the smallest girl because she would be too short to fit into the other layers.

### Step 9: Deduce the position of the smallest girl.
Given the structure, the smallest girl must be one of the two remaining girls who do not fit into any of the previous layers but still need to be included in some way. Since the second largest girl (60 inches) does not belong to the bottom or middle layers, the only logical placement left is as the smallest girl.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the shortest girl (the smallest possible height under given conditions) will be placed on top of the pyramid.

So, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

2. **Calculate the total time spent walking:**
   - Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour.
   - Therefore, for 40 hours of work, she will have walked \( 40 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - After working for 5 days, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how old Angela will be in four years.
Brett is currently 14 years old. In four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.

Let \(A\) represent Angela’s current age. According to the problem, in four years Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times (14) \]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation.
Substitute Brett's age into the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 14 \]
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

### Step 3: Solve for Angela's current age.
Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to isolate \(A\):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently **38** years old.<|im_end|>","Four years from now Angela will be 14*3=<<14*3=42>>42.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of rides per day
Paul drives for 14 days, with 2 rides per day.

- Number of rides per day = 2
- Number of days = 14

Total rides over 14 days = \( 2 \times 14 \)

\[
2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ rides}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of morning rides
Each morning, Paul spends approximately $6 on a ride.

Number of mornings in 14 days = 14 (since there are 2 rides per day and they occur every day).

Cost of morning rides = \( 14 \times 6 \)

\[
14 \times 6 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of afternoon rides
Each afternoon, Paul spends approximately $2 on a ride.

Number of afternoons in 14 days = 14 (since there are 2 rides per day and they occur every day).

Cost of afternoon rides = \( 14 \times 2 \)

\[
14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all rides
Total cost of morning rides = $84
Total cost of afternoon rides = $28

Total cost of all rides = \( 84 + 28 \)

\[
84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is \(\boxed{112}\).<|im_end|>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many Greek Orange Pies (GOPs) Brianne and Ashley can make, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges each person brings:**
   - Ashley brings 5 boxes with 10 oranges per box.
     \[
     \text{Oranges from Ashley} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges}
     \]

   - Brianne brings 20 more oranges than Ashley.
     \[
     \text{Oranges from Brianne} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 50 \text{ (from Ashley)} + 70 \text{ (from Brianne)} = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Determine how many GOPs they can make given that each GOP requires 3 oranges:**
   \[
   \text{Number of GOPs} = \frac{\text{Total oranges}}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40 \text{ GOPs}
   \]

Therefore, Brianne and Ashley together can make 40 Greek Orange Pies. The final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation that represents the total cost at both venues as a function of the number of guests attending.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of guests attending.

2. **Cost Calculation for Venue A (Flat Fee + Food):**
   - Flat fee: $200
   - Cost per guest without food: $25
   - Total cost = Flat fee + (Number of guests * Cost per guest)
   \[
   C_A(x) = 200 + 25x
   \]

3. **Cost Calculation for Venue B (Per Person Charge + Food Included):**
   - Per person charge: $25
   - Food included: $5 per person
   - Total cost = Per person charge * Number of guests + Food cost per guest
   \[
   C_B(x) = 25x + 5x = 30x
   \]
   
4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) where the costs are equal.
   \[
   200 + 25x = 30x
   \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   Subtract \( 25x \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):
   \[
   200 = 5x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   To make the two venues cost the same, 40 guests must attend either venue.

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 40. 

\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.

By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of insects found by Lily.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( L \) represent the number of insects found by Lily.
   Let \( D \) represent the number of insects found by David.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of insects found by Bodhi.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - The total number of insects collected by all three is 43:
     \[
     L + D + B = 43
     \]
   - Lily found 7 more insects than David:
     \[
     L = D + 7
     \]
   - David found half as many insects as Bodhi:
     \[
     D = \frac{B}{2}
     \]

3. **Substitute into Total Insects Equation:**
   Substitute \( D = \frac{B}{2} \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
   \[
   L = \frac{B}{2} + 7
   \]
   Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the total insects equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) + \frac{B}{2} + B = 43
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   B + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   \[
   2B + 7 = 43
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2B = 36
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   B = 18
   \]

6. **Find \( D \) and \( L \) Using \( B \):**
   Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \):
   \[
   D = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   
   And since \( L = D + 7 \):
   \[
   L = 9 + 7 = 16

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much yarn Mariah and her grandma used together. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much yarn Mariah used
- Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein.
- We know there are 364 yards in a skein.

Therefore, the amount of yarn Mariah used can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 \text{ yards}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much yarn Grandma used
- Grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein.
- Again, there are 364 yards in a skein.

Therefore, the amount of yarn Grandma used can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Yarn used by Grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \text{ yards}
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\text{Yarn used by Grandma} = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of yarn used
To find out how many yards of yarn were used altogether, we add the amounts used by Mariah and Grandma:
\[
\text{Total yarn used} = \text{Yarn used by Mariah} + \text{Yarn used by Grandma}
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total yarn used} = 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer is: {The final answer is}. Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used a total of **273** yards of yarn altogether.<|im_end|>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.

To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, let's break down the problem into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial gifts needed for her friends**

Cherrie has 5 friends. According to the information provided:

- 2 friends want 5 gifts each.
- The remaining 3 friends want 2 gifts each.

Let's calculate the total number of gifts needed for these groups first.

For the two friends who want 5 gifts each:
\[ 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts} \]

For the three friends who want 2 gifts each:
\[ 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts} \]

Now, add both amounts together:
\[ 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} \]

**Step 2: Add the additional random gifts**

Cherrie decided to get 10 more random gifts.

**Step 3: Sum up all the gifts**

Total number of gifts Cherrie bought:
\[ 16 \text{ initial gifts} + 10 \text{ additional gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts} \]

                    The rug is 5 ; feet , wider . than the chair. The couch ; is ; 2 feet longer than twice the ? width of ? the rug. If ? the ! chair is 3 : feet wide. How many feet long is the ; couch?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the couch based on the given information about the rug and the chair. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the width of the rug:**
   - The rug is described as being 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - The chair is given to be 3 feet wide.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \text{ feet}
     \]
     Substituting the value for the chair:
     \[
     \text{Width of the rug} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the length of the couch:**
   - The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - We already know the width of the rug is 8 feet.
   - Twice the width of the rug can be calculated as:
     \[
     2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Adding 2 feet to this value gives us the length of the couch:
     \[
     \text{Length of the couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
     \]

So, the final answer is that the couch is 18 feet long.<|im_end|>","Chair = <<3=3>>3 feet
Rug = 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 feet
Couch = 2 * 8 + 2 = <<2*8+2=18>>18 feet
The couch is <<18=18>>18 feet long.

                    Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She . bought ; four packs : of ; gum ? the last time she was at the store. She got : two packs , of her favorite flavor, strawberry.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on grape gum:**
   - Suzie bought one pack of grape gum.
   - The price per pack of grape gum is $2.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on grape gum is \( 2 \times 1 = \$2 \).

2. **Determine the amount spent on green apple gum:**
   - Suzie paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum compared to grape gum.
   - Since grape gum costs $2, green apple gum costs \( \frac{2}{2} = \$1 \).
   - Let's denote the number of packs of green apple gum Suzie bought as \( x \). So, the total amount spent on green apple gum is \( 1 \times x = \$x \).

3. **Calculate the total amount spent on all types of gum:**
   - We know that the total amount spent on all gum is $7.
   - Therefore, the equation representing the total amount spent on all gum is \( 2 + 1 \times x = 7 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - From the equation \( 2 + x = 7 \), we can subtract 2 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = 7 - 2 = 5
     \]
   - This means Suzie bought 5 packs of green apple gum.

5. **Find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum:**
   - The total amount spent on grape gum is $2.
   - The total amount spent on all gum is $7.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on strawberry gum is \( 7 - 2 = \$5 \).
   - Since Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum (her favorite flavor), the cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( \frac{5}{2} = \$2.50 \).

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{\$2.50}
\]<|im_end|>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.
Thus, the two packs of strawberry gum cost 7 - 2 - 1 = $<<7-2-1=4>>4.
Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make given his budget constraints, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of sticks available:**
   - From a 2x4 piece of wood, Frederick gets 400 sticks.
   - From a 2x8 piece of wood, Frederick also gets 400 sticks.

   Total sticks = \(400 + 400 = 800\) sticks.

2. **Calculate the cost per stick:**
   - Cost of a 2x4 piece = $4
   - Cost of a 2x8 piece = $6

3. **Calculate the cost per stick based on the type of wood used:**
   - For the 2x4 piece:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{\$4}{400 \text{ sticks}} = \$0.01 \text{ per stick}
     \]
   - For the 2x8 piece:
     \[
     \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{\$6}{800 \text{ sticks}} = \$0.075 \text{ per stick}
     \]

4. **Compare the costs to find the cheaper option:**
   - The 2x4 piece costs $0.01 per stick.
   - The 2x8 piece costs $0.075 per stick.

Since the 2x4 piece is cheaper, Frederick should use it.

5. **Determine how many sticks Frederick can make with his budget:**
   - Frederick has $24 in total.
   - Cost per stick (2x4) = $0.01

   Number of sticks Frederick can make = \(\frac{\$24}{\$0.01 \text{ per stick}} = 2400 \text{ sticks}\)

Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, buying the cheapest wood, is 2400.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of dogs
Mario has 6 dogs.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Each dog has 4 legs. Since snowshoes are designed to distribute weight evenly across the dog's paws, we need one pair per leg. Therefore, each dog requires 4 pairs of snowshoes.
- Number of pairs per dog = 4
- Total number of pairs for all dogs = 6 dogs × 4 pairs/dog = 24 pairs

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the snowshoes
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
- Cost per pair = $12.00
- Total cost for all pairs = 24 pairs × $12.00/pair = $288.00

### Final Answer

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass instead of taking individual bus trips, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of taking 5 bus trips per day:**
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   - She takes this trip 5 times in a week.

\[
\text{Cost per trip} = \$2.20
\]
\[
\text{Number of trips per day} = 5
\]

\[
\text{Total number of trips per week} = \text{Trips per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ trips}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost without a pass} = \text{Cost per trip} \times \text{Total number of trips per week} = \$2.20 \times 35 = \$77
\]

2. **Compare the total cost without a pass to the cost of a weekly pass:**

\[
\text{Cost of one weekly pass} = \$20
\]

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost without a pass} - \text{Cost of one weekly pass} = \$77 - \$20 = \$57

                    question:
                    The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows ? as the farm does.  The farm has , half as ! many sheep as the ? zoo does.  ; How many animals do the farm and zoo have combined?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many animals the farm and the zoo have in total. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the number of cows on the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   
2. **Verify that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm:**
   - If the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, then the zoo should have \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
   - However, we are given that the zoo has only 20 sheep, not cows. This suggests there might be an error or misunderstanding in the provided information about the number of cows at the zoo. Given the context, let's assume the zoo actually has cows, but since no specific number was mentioned for the zoo’s cows, we'll proceed assuming the zoo indeed has the same number of sheep as the farm (30) and double that amount (60), which doesn't align with the given information. Therefore, we'll use the correct interpretation from the problem statement where the zoo has 60 cows.
   
3. **Calculate the total number of animals at the zoo:**
   - The zoo has 60 cows.
   - The zoo also has 20 sheep.
   - So, the total number of animals at the zoo is \(60 + 20 = 80\).

4. **Determine the number of sheep on the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - Since the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and the zoo has 60 cows, the farm must have \(\frac{60}{2} = 30\) sheep.
   
5. **Calculate the total number of animals on the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The farm also has 30 sheep.
   - So, the total number of animals on the farm is \(30 + 30 = 60\).
   
6. **Sum the totals from both the farm and the zoo:**
   - The farm has 60 animals.
   - The zoo has 80 animals.
   - Therefore, the total number of animals combined is \(60 + 80 = 140\).

So, the final answer is:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the quantities of onions and potatoes that Rose bought:**
   - Rose bought 12 onions.
   - Rose bought 4 potatoes.

2. **Calculate the quantity of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought:**
   - According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many calories Andy needs to consume daily to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds within one month, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Calories Needed to Lose 30 Pounds
Andy aims to lose 30 pounds. We know that burning 3500 calories per pound will help him achieve this goal.

\[ \text{Total Calorie Deficit} = 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} \]

\[ \text{Total Calorie Deficit} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 2: Determine Daily Caloric Intake
Let \( D \) represent the total number of days in January after December 31st until July 19th. 

Since there are 31 days in December and no other months mentioned, the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th would be:

\[ D = 31 \text{ days (December)} + 31 \text{ days (January)} + \ldots + x \text{ days (July)} \]

Assuming it’s a leap year and July has 31 days, let’s calculate for a standard year where July also has 31 days:

\[ D = 31 \text{ days (Dec)} + 31 \text{ days (Jan)} + 31 \text{ days (Feb)} + 31 \text{ days (Mar)} + 31 \text{ days (Apr)} + 31 \text{ days (May)} + 31 \text{ days (Jun)} + 31 \text{ days (Jul)} \]

This totals up to 31 * 7 = 217 days.

Therefore, if Andy burns 3500 calories per pound, then he needs to consume approximately:

\[ \text{Daily Calorie Intake} = \frac{\text{Total Calories}}{D} \]

Given:

\[ \text{Total Calories} = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]
\[ \text{Days} = 217 \text{ days} \]

We get:

\[ \text{Daily Calorie Intake} = \frac{105,000}{217} \approx 486.74 \text{ calories/day} \]

### Conclusion:
Andy needs to consume approximately **486.74** calories per day to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds over the course of seven months (including December).

Thus, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{486.74}
\]<|im_end|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah runs:**
   - Each lap is 0.25 kilometers.
   - She runs 8 laps.

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance per Lap} \times \text{Number of Laps}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} \times 8 \, \text{laps} = 2 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Convert the total distance from kilometers to millimeters:**

   Since 1 kilometer equals 1,000 meters and 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, then:

   \[
   1 \, \text{km} = 1000 \, \text{m} \quad \text{and} \quad 1 \, \text{m} = 100 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Therefore,

   \[
   1 \, \text{km} = 1000 \, \text{m} \times 100 \, \text{cm/m} = 100,000 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Now convert kilometers to millimeters (since \(1 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{cm}\)):

   \[
   1 \, \text{km} = 100,000 \, \text{cm} \div 0.1 \, \text{cm/mm} = 1,000,000 \, \text{mm}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water needed:**

   According to the information given in the problem, Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.

   \[
   \text{Total Water Needed} = \text{Water Per Kilometer} \times \text{Total Distance}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Water Needed} = 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 1,000,000 \, \text{mm/km}
   \]

4. **Simplify the calculation:**

   \[
   \text{Total Water Needed} = 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 1,000,000 \, \text{mm/km} = 60 \times 1,000,000 \, \text{ml}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Water Needed} = 60,000,000 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 60,000,000 ml of water. The final answer is:

\boxed{60,000,000 \, \text{ml}}<|im_end|>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km
Then multiply the number of kilometers she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer to find the total amount of water she needs: 60 ml/km * 2 km = <<60*2=120>>120 ml

                    Julie ! had . $500. She spent 20% : of it on clothes ? and then 25% ? of the remaining money ; on ! CDs. How much money ; did Julie have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much Julie spent on clothes.
2. Determine how much money was left after buying clothes.
3. Calculate how much she spent on CDs from the remaining amount.
4. Find out how much money Julie has left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate how much Julie spent on clothes
Julie initially had $500. She spent 20% of her money on clothes.

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \times \$500 \]

First, convert the percentage into a decimal:

\[ 20\% = 0.20 \]

Now, multiply:

\[ \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times \$500 = \$100 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money was left after buying clothes
Subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial total:

\[ \text{Remaining money after clothes} = \$500 - \$100 = \$400 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much Julie spent on CDs
After buying clothes, Julie had $400 left. She then spent 25% of this remaining amount on CDs.

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \times \$400 \]

Convert the percentage into a decimal:

\[ 25\% = 0.25 \]

Now, multiply:

\[ \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times \$400 = \$100 \]

### Step 4: Find out how much money Julie has left
Subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining money after buying clothes:

\[ \text{Money left after CDs} = \$400 - \$100 = \$300 \]

So, Julie has **$300** left.

The final answer is: The final answer is $300.<|im_end|>","Julie spend $500 * 0.2 = $<<500*0.2=100>>100 for clothes.

She spend $400 * 0.25 = $<<400*0.25=100>>100 on CDs.
Julie had $400 - $100 = $<<400-100=300>>300 left.

                    question:
                    A house and a lot cost $120,000. If the house cost three times as much ; as the lot, how , much did , the ; house cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define two variables to represent the costs:

- Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.
- Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.

We know from the problem statement that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Additionally, we are told that the house costs three times as much as the lot:

\[ H = 3L \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( H \) (from the second equation into the first equation):

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to isolate \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we have determined the cost of the lot (\( L \)), we can find the cost of the house using the relationship \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the final answer is: The house cost $\boxed{90,000}$.<|im_end|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

To determine Tara's profit from selling the canvas bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of buying the canvas bags:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs of canvas bags.
   - Each pack costs $4.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 8 \times \$4 = \$32
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:**
   - Tara sells each bag for $8.

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 8 \times \$8 = \$64
   \]

3. **Determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:**

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]

   Substituting in our values:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$64 - \$32 = \$32

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has.

- Ali has four $10 bills:
  \[
  4 \times \$10 = \$40
  \]

- He also has six $20 bills:
  \[
  6 \times \$20 = \$120
  \]

- Adding these together gives us the total amount of money Ali has:
  \[
  \$40 + \$120 = \$160
  \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Ali gives to her sister.

- Ali gives her sister half of her total money:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times \$160 = \$80
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after giving some to her sister.

- Subtracting the amount given from the initial total gives us the remaining money:
  \[
  \$160 - \$80 = \$80

### Step 4: Determine how much money Ali spends on dinner.

- Ali spends three-fifths of the remaining money on dinner:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times \$80 = \$48

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we'll calculate the total number of items required for each grandchild and then multiply that by the number of grandchildren.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of hats needed
- Each grandchild requires one hat.
- There are 3 grandchildren.

Number of hats = 3 (grandchildren) × 1 (hat per child) = 3 hats

Each hat requires:
- 2 skeins of wool

Total wool for hats = 3 hats × 2 skeins/hat = 6 skeins

### Step 2: Calculate the number of scarves needed
- Each grandchild requires one scarf.
- There are 3 grandchildren.

Number of scarfs = 3 (grandchildren) × 1 (scarf per child) = 3 scarfs

Each scarf requires:
- 4 skeins of wool

Total wool for scarfs = 3 scarfs × 4 skeins/scarf = 12 skeins

### Step 3: Calculate the number of sweaters needed
- Each grandchild requires one sweater.
- There are 3 grandchildren.

Number of sweaters = 3 (grandchildren) × 1 (sweater per child) = 3 sweaters

Each sweater requires:
- 12 skeins of wool

Total wool for sweaters = 3 sweaters × 12 skeins/sweater = 36 skeins

### Step 4: Calculate the number of pairs of mittens needed
- Each grandchild requires two pairs of mittens.
- There are 3 grandchildren.

Number of pairs of mittens = 3 grandchildren × 2 pairs/mitten = 6 pairs

Each pair of mittens requires:
- 1 skein of wool

Total wool for mittens = 6 pairs × 1 skein/pair = 6 skeins

### Step 5: Calculate the number of pairs of socks needed
- Each grandchild requires two pairs of socks.
- There are 3 grandchildren.

Number of pairs of socks = 3 grandchildren × 2 pairs/sock = 6 pairs

Each pair of socks requires:
- 2 skeins of wool

Total wool for socks = 6 pairs × 2 skeins/pair = 12 skeins

### Step 6: Sum up the total wool needed
- Hats: 6 skeins
- Scarves: 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 36 skeins
- Mittens: 6 skeins
- Socks: 12 skeins

Total wool needed = 6 + 12 + 36 + 6 + 12 = 78 skeins

Therefore, Martha will need **78** skeins of wool to buy. The final answer is:

{The final answer is} 78 skeins.<|im_end|>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.

\[ \text{Problems completed on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

So, Chris completes 36 problems on Tuesday.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.
- Total problems initially: 100
- Problems completed on Monday: 12
- Problems completed on Tuesday: 36

\[ \text{Remaining problems} = 100 - (12 + 36) \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 100 - (12 + 36) = 100 - 48 = 52 \]

Chris has 52 problems remaining after completing these two days' work.

### Step 3: Determine how many problems Chris completes on Wednesday.

\[ \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

So, Chris completes 13 problems on Wednesday.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.
- Remaining problems before Wednesday: 52
- Problems completed on Wednesday: 13

\[ \text{Remaining problems} = 52 - 13 \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

After completing Wednesday's work, Chris has 39 problems left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then sum these values.

1. **Calculate the rate at which Tony picks strawberries:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.

2. **Calculate the rate at which Bobby picks strawberries:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
     \[
     \text{Bobby's rate} = 6 \text{ quarts/hour} - 1 \text{ quart/hour} = 5 \text{ quarts/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the rate at which Kathy picks strawberries:**
   - Kathy picks twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
     \[
     \text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times 5 \text{ quarts/hour} = 10 \text{ quarts/hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the rate at which Ricky picks strawberries:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
     \[
     \text{Ricky's rate} = 10 \text{ quarts/hour} - 2 \text{ quarts/hour} = 8 \text{ quarts/hour}
     \]

5. **Sum the rates for all four individuals:**
   - Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky together.
     \[
     \text{Total rate} = (6 + 5 + 10 + 8) \text{ quarts/hour} = 29 \text{ quarts/hour}
     \]

Thus, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour on Grandma Concetta’s farm is **29 quarts**.<|im_end|>","Bobby picks one fewer quart of strawberries per hour than the 6 quarts of berries per hour that Tony can pick, for a total of 6-1=<<6-1=5>>5 quarts per hour.

To determine how many loaves of bread the bakery has left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loaves sold.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold from the initial amount.
3. Subtract the number of loaves returned.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of loaves sold.
- Loaves sold in the morning = 93
- Loaves sold in the afternoon = 39
Total loaves sold = 93 + 39 = 132

Step 2: Subtract the number of loaves sold from the initial amount.
Initial number of loaves = 200
Loaves remaining after sales = 200 - 132 = 68

Step 3: Subtract the number of loaves returned.
Loaves returned = 6
Final number of loaves left = 68 - 6 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is: The bakery has 62 loaves of bread left.<|im_end|>","The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of rows for each color:**
   - For red tulips:
     - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in one row.
     - Total red tulips = 36.
     - Number of rows for red tulips = Total red tulips / Red tulips per row = 36 / 6 = 6 rows.

   - For blue tulips:
     - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in one row.
     - Total blue tulips = 24.
     - Number of rows for blue tulips = Total blue tulips / Blue tulips per row = 24 / 8 = 3 rows.

2. **Calculate the total number of rows:**
   - Total rows = Rows of red tulips + Rows of blue tulips = 6 + 3 = 9 rows.

Therefore, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers. 

{The final answer is} 9 rows.<|im_end|>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Raisins**: Heather has 27 cups of raisins.
   
2. **Batch Size for Cookies**: Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.

3. **Number of Batches**: We need to determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made from the total raisins.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of batches that can be made using all the raisins.**

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made, we divide the total amount of raisins (27 cups) by the amount required per batch ( \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup).

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total raisins}}{\text{Raisins per batch}} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}} \]

**Step 2: Simplify the division.**

Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 9 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 36 \]

So, Heather can make **36 batches** of oatmeal cookies from the raisins.<|im_end|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                    question:
                    Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour . a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total electricity cost before and after adding the new device, then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's current weekly electricity consumption.
Ada consumes 12 kilowatts (kW) per hour. There are 24 hours in a day, so her daily electricity consumption is:
\[ \text{Daily Consumption} = 12 \, \text{kW/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \]

There are 7 days in a week, so her weekly electricity consumption is:
\[ \text{Weekly Consumption} = 288 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2016 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of Ada's current weekly electricity bill.
If one kWh costs $1.50, then the cost for 2016 kWh is:
\[ \text{Current Weekly Cost} = 2016 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$3024 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the new weekly electricity consumption if the device is added.
After adding the device, which consumes 2 kW per hour, her new daily consumption would be:
\[ \text{New Daily Consumption} = 12 \, \text{kW/hour} + 2 \, \text{kW/hour} = 14 \, \text{kW/hour} \]

Her new weekly consumption would then be:
\[ \text{New Weekly Consumption} = 14 \, \text{kW/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 24192 \, \text{kWh/week} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the new weekly electricity cost.
At $1.50 per kWh, the cost for 24192 kWh would be:
\[ \text{New Weekly Cost} = 24192 \, \text{kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$36288 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in cost between the old and new weekly bills.
The difference in cost is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{New Weekly Cost} - \text{Current Weekly Cost} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$36288 - \$3024 = \$33264 \]

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is $\boxed{\$33264}$.<|im_end|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                    question:
                    If one person can paint half a house . in 5 days, how many hours would it take for 5 people to ! paint a . whole house?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the work rate per person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person can paint \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a house in 5 days.

2. **Calculate the total amount of work required:**
   - We need to find out how much work (in terms of houses painted) five people can do together.

3. **Convert the work rate from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Since one person paints half a house in 5 days, we first convert the painting time from days to hours:
     \[
     \text{One person's work rate in hours} = \frac{5 \text{ days}}{24 \text{ hours/day}}
     \]
   - Simplify this:
     \[
     \text{One person's work rate in hours} = \frac{5}{24}
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined work rate for five people:**
   - Five people working together will have a combined work rate that is five times their individual work rate.
   - Therefore, the combined work rate for five people is:
     \[
     \text{Combined work rate for five people} = 5 \times \left( \frac{5}{24} \right)
     \]
   - Simplify this expression:
     \[
     \text{Combined work rate for five people} = \frac{25}{24}
     \]

5. **Find out how long it takes for five people to paint one whole house:**
   - To determine the number of hours it takes for five people to paint one whole house, we divide the total work needed (which is 1 whole house) by their combined work rate.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Time taken by five people to paint one whole house} = \frac{1 \text{ whole house}}{\frac{25}{24} \text{ houses/hour}}
     \]
   - Simplify this expression:
     \[
     \text{Time taken by five people to paint one whole house} = \frac{1 \times 24}{25} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - This simplifies further to:
     \[
     \text{Time taken by five people to paint one whole house} = \frac{24}{25} \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Convert the result back to hours if necessary:**
   - The final answer should be expressed as a decimal or fraction of an hour.
   - However, since the problem asks for ""hours"", we express our final answer directly.

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{\frac{24}{25} \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has.
   - Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, we can write: \( J = 3C \).
   - We know Ophelia has 20 sofas, so if we let \( S \) be the number of sofas Ophelia has, then \( S = 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Given that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, we can express this relationship as: \( J_s = S + 2 \).
   - Substituting the value for Ophelia's sofas into this equation gives us: \( J_s = 20 + 2 \).

4. **Simplify to find the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - \( J_s = 22 \).

5. **Find the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Using the earlier relationship \( J = 3C \), we substitute \( J_s = 22 \):
     \[
     22 = 3C
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \) (the number of chairs Jenna has): 
     \[
     C = \frac{22}{3} \approx 7.33
     \]

6. **Verify the consistency of the data:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas, and since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, Jenna should indeed have approximately 7.33 chairs, which doesn't align with our calculated value. This indicates there might be an error or misunderstanding in the initial conditions provided.

Given these steps, it seems there may be a mistake in the provided information. The calculation based on the given relationships does not yield a consistent set of values for the number of sofas and chairs. Therefore, without rechecking all assumptions and recalculations, it’s impossible to determine the correct total number of sofas and chairs based solely on the provided details. 

**Final Answer:** The total number of sofas and chairs cannot be determined from the given information due to inconsistencies in the provided data.<|im_end|>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

   - Tom spent a total of $48 on his purchase.
   - He also purchased an headphone set.

2. **Calculate the amount spent on the headphone set:**
   - The total amount spent ($48) minus the amount spent on the CD equals the cost of the headphone set.

<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the course of 8 weeks. We know from the information provided:

1. He worked out for 4 hours per week (except for some instances).
2. There were instances where he worked out for 5 hours consecutively.
3. There was another instance where he worked out for 6 hours.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours without considering special cases

Josh worked out for 4 hours per week for 7 full weeks (since there was at least one full week):

\[ 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 7 \text{ weeks} = 28 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Account for the special case where he worked out for 5 hours consecutively

Since he worked out for 5 hours consecutively twice, we add those hours together:

\[ 5 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, now we have:

\[ 28 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} = 38 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Adjust for the third special case where he worked out for 6 hours

We subtract these hours because they were not part of his regular weekly schedule but rather an exceptional occurrence:

\[ 38 \text{ hours} - 6 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]<|im_end|>","For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours

2+1 = <<2+1=3>>3 weeks have been accounted for

                    question:
                    48 people are , riding ? a bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get ? off, and , 5 times as many people as the . number who ? got off : from ! the bus get into the bus. ?

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to track the number of passengers getting on and off the bus at each stop. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Number of Passengers
Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

### Step 2: First Stop
- **Number of People Who Got Off**: We're given that 8 people got off.
- **Remaining Passengers After First Stop**:
  \[
  48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
  \]

### Step 3: Second Stop
- **Number of People Who Got Off**: The problem states that 21 people got off.
- **Passengers Left Before Second Stop**:
  \[
  40 - 21 = 19 \text{ passengers}
  \]
- **People Getting On in the Second Stop**:
  According to the problem, 3 times fewer than those who got off the bus (i.e., \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people).

### Step 4: Calculate Total Passengers After Second Stop
- **Total Passengers After Second Stop**:
  \[
  19 + 7 = 26 \text{ passengers}
  \]

Thus, the total number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{26}\).<|im_end|>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.
After the first stop the bus has ( 48 - 8 ) + 40 = <<48-8+40=80>>80 passengers.
At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine James' current age:**
   - James will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, James' current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\).

2. **Set up an equation for the cousin's future age:**
   - Let \(C\) represent the cousin's current age.
   - In 8 years, the cousin's age will be \(C + 8\).
   - According to the problem, this will be 5 years less than twice James' current age.
     \[
     C + 8 = 2 \times 22 - 5
     \]

3. **Solve for \(C\):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 44 - 5
     \]
     \[
     C + 8 = 39
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate \(C\):
     \[
     C = 39 - 8
     \]
     \[
     C = 31
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference between their ages:**
   - James' current age is 22.
   - The cousin's current age is 31.
   - Therefore, the difference in their ages is \(31 - 22 = 9\).

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: \(\boxed{9}\) years.<|im_end|>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total cost**: The total amount spent on all items is $2,400.

2. **Subtract the known costs**:
   - We know that Errol paid $400 less for the printer than he did for the computer.
   - If the computer costs $1,100, then the printer must have cost $50 more (since $1,100 - $400 = $700).

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after accounting for the printer**:
   - Subtract the cost of the printer from the total cost: 
     $2,400 - $700 = $1,700.

4. **Determine the combined cost of the two monitors**:
   - The remaining $1,700 should be split between the two monitors because we don't know their individual costs yet.

5. **Find out what each monitor costs individually**:
   - Let the cost of one monitor be represented as M.
   - Since there are two monitors, their combined cost would be 2M.
   - Therefore, 2M = $1,700.
   
6. **Solve for M**:
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the cost of one monitor:
     $$ \frac{2M}{2} = \frac{$1,700}{2} $$
     $$ M = $850 $$

Therefore, the final answer is: One monitor cost $850 in dollars.<|im_end|>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.

   - Therefore, there must be 10 girls and 10 boys.

3. **Calculate the total number of shells brought by the boys**:
   - Each boy brought 60 shells.
   - With 10 boys, the total number of shells brought by the boys is \(10 \times 60 = 600\) shells.

4. **Define the variable for the number of shells brought by the girls**:
   - Let \(G\) represent the total number of shells brought by the girls.

5. **Set up the equation based on the given condition**:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Candies:**
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George initially had.
   - Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had \( 2G \) candies.

2. **George Eats Candies:**
   - George eats 5 candies.
   - After eating, George has \( G - 5 \) candies left.

3. **Final Number of Candies Left for George:**
   - According to the problem, after eating, George has 3 candies left.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]

4. **Solve for \( G \):**
   \[
   G - 5 = 3 \\
   G = 8
   \]
   So, George initially had 8 candies.

5. **Calculate Nick's Initial Candies:**
   - Since Nick had twice as many candies as George,
   \[
   2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]
   So, Nick initially had 16 candies.

Therefore, the final answer is that Nick has 16 candies.<|im_end|>","George has 3 candies now but he already ate 5. So he had 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 candies at the start.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Chenny, Alyana, and Anne based on the given information.

Step 1: Determine Chenny's age.
Chenny is stated to be 10 years old.

Step 2: Determine Alyana's age.
Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny. Therefore, we can calculate Alyana's age as follows:

\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = \text{Chenny's Age} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = 10 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = 6 \]

So, Alyana is 6 years old.

Step 3: Determine Anne's age.
Anne is 2 years older than Alyana. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's age as follows:

\[ \text{Anne's Age} = \text{Alyana's Age} + 2 \]
\[ \text{Anne's Age} = 6 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Anne's Age} = 8 \]

To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book based on the given information.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the thickness of the third book
We know that the third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book.
- Second book thickness = 50 mm
- Third book thickness = Second book thickness - 5 mm
\[ \text{Third Book Thickness} = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm \]

### Step 2: Determine the thickness of the fourth book
We know that the fourth book is twice as thick as the first book.
- First book thickness = 31 mm
- Fourth book thickness = 2 * First book thickness
\[ \text{Fourth Book Thickness} = 2 \times 31 mm = 62 mm \]

### Step 3: Sum up the thicknesses of all four books
Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books together.
\[ \text{Total Thickness} = \text{First Book Thickness} + \text{Second Book Thickness} + \text{Third Book Thickness} + \text{Fourth Book Thickness} \]
\[ \text{Total Thickness} = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm \]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum
\[ \text{Total Thickness} = 31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm \]
\[ \text{Total Thickness} = 188 mm \]

     - First week: 18 vlogs made.
     - Second week: 21 vlogs made.
     - Third week: 15 vlogs made.

2. **Calculate total vlogs completed so far**:
   - First week: 18 vlogs.
   - Second week: 21 vlogs.
   - Third week: 15 vlogs.

   \[
   18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \text{ vlogs}

3. **Determine remaining vlogs needed**:
   - Total vlogs needed (72) - Vlogs already completed (54)

   \[
   72 - 54 = 18 \text{ vlogs}

   \[
   \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \text{ vlogs per week}

So, Emma needs to do **4.5 vlogs per week** to meet her goal.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount including the extra 20% tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - An additional 20% tip is wanted.

   First, calculate 20% of $50:
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

   Add this tip to the original bill:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine how much you should pay:**
   - Your wife wants you to pay an even split of the bill, which means she will also pay half of the total calculated above.

   So, divide the total amount (including the tip) by 2:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Therefore, according to your wife's request, you would pay **$30** out of the $60 total bill. This way, both you and your wife contribute equally to the bill.<|im_end|>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Determine how much each boy initially gets**

Given that $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy's initial share is:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the eldest boy's additional contributions**

- On the first day, the eldest adds $5.
- On the second day, the eldest adds an additional $10.

Total contribution on the second day:
\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount contributed by the eldest boy before spending any money is:
\[ 6 (initial) + 5 (first day) + 10 (second day) = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Account for the $8 spent by the eldest**

After spending $8, the remaining amount in the eldest's possession is:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Triple the remaining amount**

After tripling the remaining amount:
\[ 13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[ \boxed{39} \]<|im_end|>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

                    question:
                    ! Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125. In April, . he wants to : save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half in order to hit his target. How much does he have to ! save for each day in the second half of the month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total savings needed per month
Elvis wants to reach a total of $1125 over the course of one month.

### Step 2: Calculate the savings required for the second half of the month
Since there are typically 30 days in a month, we can divide the total savings goal by 2 to find out how much Elvis needs to save in the second half.
- Total savings goal = $1125
- Second half savings (in full) = $1125 / 2 = $562.5

### Step 3: Understand the relationship between the two halves of the month
Elvis wants to save twice as much during the second half compared to the first half.

### Step 4: Set up an equation to find the daily savings for the second half
Let \( x \) represent the amount Elvis saves on average each day in the second half of the month.

- The total savings for the second half would then be \( 2x \).

### Step 5: Write the equation based on the given condition
According to the problem, Elvis saves twice as much in the second half as in the first half. This means:
\[ 2x = 2 \times (\text{average savings per day}) \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
We know that the total savings for the second half should equal $562.5. Therefore,
\[ 2x = 562.5 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{562.5}{2} \]
\[ x = 281.25 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Elvis has to save **$281.25** for each day in the second half of the month.<|im_end|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits.
- **Apples**: 
  - Number of apples = 3
  - Cost per apple = $1.50
  - Total cost for apples = 3 × $1.50 = $4.50

- **Oranges**:
  - Number of oranges = 5
  - Cost per orange = $0.80
  - Total cost for oranges = 5 × $0.80 = $4.00

- **Peaches**:
  - Number of peaches = 6
  - Cost per peach = $0.75
  - Total cost for peaches = 6 × $0.75 = $4.50

### Step 2: Add up all the costs to get the total amount spent.
- Total cost for apples = $4.50
- Total cost for oranges = $4.00
- Total cost for peaches = $4.50
- Total amount spent = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

### Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent from the amount given.
- Amount given = $20.00
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The change Verna received is $7.00.<|im_end|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.

Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Jairus and Jenny earn for completing their respective number of tasks.

1. **Calculate Jairus's earnings:**
   - Each task earns Jairus $0.8.
   - He completed 20 tasks.
   \[
   \text{Jairus's total earnings} = 20 \times 0.8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Jenny's earnings:**
   - Each task earns Jenny $0.5.
   - She also completed 20 tasks.
   \[
   \text{Jenny's total earnings} = 20 \times 0.5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much more Jairus earns compared to Jenny:**
   - Subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings.
   \[
   \text{Difference in earnings} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Jairus will earn $6 more than Jenny after they both finish 20 tasks.

**The final answer is:** The difference in earnings between Jairus and Jenny is $6.<|im_end|>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives.

### Step 2: Express Jeff's Amount in Terms of Brad's Amount
Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Therefore, if Brad gets \( B \), then Jeff gets \( 4B \).

### Step 3: Set Up an Equation
We know that together they should receive $100. So we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( B \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad gets $20.

### Step 6: Find Jeff's Amount
Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad:
\[ J = 4B \]
\[ J = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ J = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets **$80**.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down Elise's writing process step by step.

1. **First Full Alphabet Write:**
   - Elise writes the entire alphabet.
   - Number of letters in the alphabet = 26 (assuming we're using lowercase English letters).

2. **Second Full Alphabet Write:**
   - After the first full alphabet, she starts again from the beginning but stops at some point before completing the second full alphabet.
   - This means she continues writing from where she left off after the first full alphabet.

3. **Writing Half of the Alphabet Once:**
   - Elise writes half of the alphabet once more.
   - Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, half of them is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) letters.

4. **Re-Writing Everything She Has Already Written:**
   - At this stage, Elise will have written both the full alphabet and half of it.
   - Total number of letters written so far = \( 26 + 13 = 39 \).
   - She now writes all these letters again, effectively rewriting everything she has already written.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of letters Elise has written is the sum of what she wrote initially plus what she rewrote.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters is \( 39 \times 2 = 78 \).

So, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Elise has written the alphabet twice which is a total of 26 * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.

   - Number of new families called in this round = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

3. **Second Round (Round 2):**
   - Now there are \( 3 + 9 = 12 \) families that have not been notified yet.
   - Each of these 12 families calls 3 other families.
   - Number of new families called in this round = \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \).

4. **Third Round (Round 3):**
   - Now there are \( 12 + 36 = 48 \) families that have not been notified yet.

To determine how many toys Jonathan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of James's play set.
2. Calculate the size of Jonathan's play set based on the information given about his toy collection.

Let's start with the information provided:

- James's play set has 80 toys.
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than what he already has to fill his play set, making it ""five times"" larger than James's play set.

First, let's find out how many toys Jonathan would need to match James's play set exactly. Since his current number of toys makes it ""five times"" larger than James's play set, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of toys for James's play set} = 5 \times \text{Number of toys Jonathan should have} \]

Given that James's play set has 80 toys, we can write:

\[ 80 = 5 \times (\text{Number of toys Jonathan should have}) \]

Solving for the number of toys Jonathan should have:

\[ \text{Number of toys Jonathan should have} = \frac{80}{5} \]
\[ \text{Number of toys Jonathan should have} = 16 \]

Now, since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than this amount to fill his play set, we can add those 2 toys to the 16 toys he should have:

\[ \text{Total number of toys Jonathan currently has} = 16 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total number of toys Jonathan currently has} = 18 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost before any discounts.
First, we need to determine how many of each item Daniel buys.

- Notebooks: 5
- Pens: 2
- Calculator: 1
- Geometry sets: 1 (since he only needs one)

Now, calculate the total cost for each type of item without considering the discount.

- Cost of notebooks = 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- Cost of pens = 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- Cost of calculator = 1 * $12 = $12
- Cost of geometry sets = 1 * $10 = $10

Total cost before discount = $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $30

### Step 2: Apply the discount.
Since the shop offers a 10% discount on all items, we first find out what 10% of the total cost is.

10% of $30 = $30 * 0.10 = $3

Subtract the discount from the total cost:

$30 - $3 = $27

### Final Answer:
Daniel has to spend $27 on all the items he wants to buy after applying the 10% discount. 

{The final answer is} $27.<|im_end|>","Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50

The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.
Thus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.
Therefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.

<|im_start|>system
To calculate how much money Antonella earned from selling goods worth $2500, we need to consider her commission structure:

Step 1: Determine the base commission for the first $1000 of sales.

- The base commission rate is 30%. Therefore, for the first $1000 of sales, she earns:
\[ \text{Base Commission} = \$1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

Step 2: Calculate the remaining sales after the first $1000.

- After the first $1000, there are:
\[ \$2500 - \$1000 = \$1500 \]
of sales left.

- The additional commission rate for these sales is 10%.

- Therefore, for the remaining $1500 of sales, she earns:
\[ \text{Additional Commission} = \$1500 \times 0.10 = \$150 \]

Step 3: Sum up both components to find the total earnings.

- Total commission:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \$300 + \$150 = \$450 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Antonella earned if she sold goods worth $2500 is $450.<|im_end|>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill currently has:**
   - Bill starts with 2 cases.
   - Each case contains 24 bottles.
   \[
   \text{Total current bottles} = 2 \times 24 = 48

2. **Determine the total number of water bottles needed:**
   - Bill has 70 guests.
   - He wants to provide 2 bottles per guest.
   \[
   \text{Total required bottles} = 70 \times 2 = 140
   \]

3. **Subtract the current number of bottles from the total required bottles to find the additional bottles needed:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Ray to swim 3 miles under both conditions (cold and warm) and then find the difference between these times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day.
Given that Ray swims a mile in \( \frac{1}{16} \) hours when the water is cold.

- Time to swim one mile = \( \frac{1}{16} \) hours
- Time to swim three miles = \( 3 \times \frac{1}{16} \) hours = \( \frac{3}{16} \) hours

Convert \( \frac{3}{16} \) hours into minutes:
\[ \frac{3}{16} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 11.25 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes **11.25 minutes** to swim 3 miles on a cold day.

### Step 2: Calculate the time for Ray to swim 3 miles on a warm day.
Given that Ray swims a mile in \( \frac{1}{16} + 2 \) minutes when the water is warm.

First, calculate the time to swim one mile at the warm temperature:
\[ \frac{1}{16} + 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert \( \frac{1}{16} \) minutes to seconds:
\[ \frac{1}{16} \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 3.75 \text{ seconds} \]

Add 2 minutes to convert 3.75 seconds to minutes:
\[ 3.75 \text{ seconds} = 0.0625 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ 0.0625 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 2.0625 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, multiply this total time by 3 to get the time to swim 3 miles:
\[ 3 \times 2.0625 \text{ minutes} = 6.1875 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Ray takes **6.1875 minutes** to swim 3 miles on a warm day.

### Step 3: Find the difference in time between the warm and cold days.
Subtract the cold day time from the warm day time:
\[ 6.1875 \text{ minutes} - 11.25 \text{ minutes} \]

This results in a negative value, indicating Ray takes less time on the cold day compared to the warm day. Therefore, the warm day is actually faster.

### Final Answer:
Ray takes **more** time to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day. Specifically, Ray takes **less** time on the warm day, which means he swims faster on the warm day. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{warm}}

   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours per day.

\[
\text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Per Day} = \$2 \times 5 = \$10
\]

2. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days per week.

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Per Week} = \$10 \times 4 = \$40
\]

3. **Determine the number of weeks needed to reach $80:**
   - We know that John needs to save $80 in total.
   - His weekly earnings are currently $40.

\[
\text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Needed}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{\$80}{\$40} = 2
\]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo from Subway based on the information given about the foot-long fish sandwich.

1. **Determine the cost per inch for the fish sandwich:**
   - The total cost for the foot-long fish sandwich is $40.
   - Let \( C \) be the cost per inch for the fish sandwich.
   - Therefore, \( 6C = 40 \).

2. **Calculate the cost per inch for the fish sandwich:**
   \[
   C = \frac{40}{6} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ dollars per inch}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the six-inch cold-cut combo:**
   - Since the six-inch cold-cut combo costs three times more than the fish sandwich, and the fish sandwich costs approximately $6.67 per inch,
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \times 6.67 \approx 20 \text{ dollars}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes in all buttons**

Given that there are 21 buttons in total, we need to find out how many of them have 4 holes.

- We know that 7 buttons have 2 holes.
- Therefore, the remaining buttons (21 - 7 = 14) must have 4 holes each.

Let's calculate the total number of holes:
\[ \text{Total holes} = (\text{Number of buttons with 2 holes}) + (\text{Number of buttons with 4 holes}) \]
\[ \text{Total holes} = 7 \times 2 + 14 \times 4 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication and addition:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]
\[ \text{Total holes} = 14 + 56 \]
\[ \text{Total holes} = 70 \]

So far, we've determined that the total number of holes across all buttons is **70**.

**Step 2: Verify if our calculation matches the given information**

Since we're not provided with any additional details or constraints about the distribution of holes among the buttons, we can conclude that our calculations are correct based on the information given.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of Peter's locker based on the volumes of Timothy's and Zack's lockers.

### Step 1: Determine the Volume of Zack's Locker
We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
- Timothy's locker volume = 24 cubic inches.
- Therefore, Zack's locker volume = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \) cubic inches.

\[
\text{Zack's locker volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Volume of Peter's Locker
Peter's locker is one-fourth the size of Zack's locker.
- Zack's locker volume = 12 cubic inches.
- Therefore, Peter's locker volume = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \) cubic inches.

\[
\text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Octavia's Coffee Consumption
- The daily recommended amount of coffee is typically around 3-5 cups per day.
- Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount.

Let's calculate her consumption:
\[ \text{Octavia's coffee} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{daily recommendation} \]

Assuming the daily recommendation is 4 cups (a common average):
\[ \text{Octavia's coffee} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Juan's Current Coffee Consumption
- Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks.
\[ \text{Juan's coffee} = 10 \times \text{Octavia's coffee} \]
\[ \text{Juan's coffee} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Step 3: Determine the Daily Recommendation for Juan
- Juan's doctor asks him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

### Step 4: Calculate How Many Cups Juan Must Reduce His Intake
- First, find out how much more coffee Juan currently consumes than he should:
\[ \text{Current consumption - Recommended intake} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups/day} \]

Now, divide this difference by Juan's current consumption rate to see what fraction of his total he can cut back:
\[ \text{Fraction to reduce} = \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Total consumption}} \]
\[ \text{Fraction to reduce} = \frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5} \]

So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by:
\[ \text{Reduction in cups} = \text{Current total} \times \text{Fraction to reduce} \]
\[ \text{Reduction in cups} = 20 \times \frac{4}{5} = 16 \text{ cups/day} \]

### Final Answer:
By reducing his daily coffee intake by **16 cups**, Juan must adhere to the daily recommendation from his doctor.<|im_end|>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

- There are 6 cages.
- 3 cages contain 10 hamsters each.
- The remaining 3 cages contain 5 guinea pigs each.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hamsters**
- Each of the 3 cages has 10 hamsters.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters = \(3 \times 10\).

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 hamsters in total.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of guinea pigs**
- Each of the 3 cages has 5 guinea pigs.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs = \(3 \times 5\).

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

So, there are 15 guinea pigs in total.

**Step 4: Sum up all the rodents**
- Hamsters: 30
- Guinea pigs: 15

Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15\)

To find the average weight of the three friends, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine Susan's weight**
- We know that Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.

\[
\text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 \text{ pounds}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Susan's weight} = 150 \text{ pounds} - 20 \text{ pounds} = 130 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine Bob's weight**
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

\[
\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight}
\]

Substituting the value found for Susan's weight:

\[
\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 \text{ pounds} = 260 \text{ pounds}

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 150 \text{ pounds} + 130 \text{ pounds} + 260 \text{ pounds} = 540 \text{ pounds}

**Step 4: Find the average weight**

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The Great Pyramid sits at an angle of 32° from the ground.
- The sun moves 5° per hour directly above the pyramid.

### Step 2: Determine the total movement of the sun over 10 hours
Given that the sun moves 5° per hour and it takes 10 hours for the sun to move completely from one point to another (from the top of the pyramid), we can calculate the total movement as follows:
\[ \text{Total Movement} = \text{Movement per Hour} \times \text{Number of Hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Movement} = 5°/hour \times 10 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Movement} = 50° \]

### Step 3: Calculate the new position of the sun after 10 hours
Since the sun initially stands on the pyramid and moves 50° upwards, its new position will be:
\[ \text{New Position} = \text{Initial Position} + \text{Total Movement} \]
\[ \text{New Position} = 32° + 50° \]
\[ \text{New Position} = 82° \]

### Conclusion
After 10 hours, the sun will be positioned at 82° from the ground.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    . James decides : to ! buy ! birthday candles for his 2 sons.  One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger.  A . pack of 5 candles costs $3.  How much does James spend on ! candles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the age difference between the two sons.
2. Calculate how many packs of candles are needed for both sons.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of packs.

Step 1: Age Difference
- The first son is 12 years old.
- The second son is 4 years younger than the first son, so he is 8 years old (12 - 4 = 8).

Step 2: Packs Needed
- Since they are buying one pack per year, regardless of their ages, they will need 1 pack for each son.

Step 3: Cost Calculation
- Each pack contains 5 candles, so 1 pack costs $3.
- For 2 sons, they would need 2 packs in total.

Now let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost of 1 pack = $3
- Total number of packs = 2
- Total cost = $3 × 2 = $6

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total amount James spends on candles is $6.<|im_end|>","His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days Judy reads in the first week.
- Judy reads for 15 minutes each night.
- There are typically 7 nights in a week.

\[
\text{Number of days in one week} = 7 \times 15 = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the total reading time from the first week to hours.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,

\[
\frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 1.75 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many pages Judy reads in one hour.
She reads at a rate of 2 pages every 1.5 minutes.

First, calculate how many 1.5-minute intervals are in 1.75 hours:

\[
\frac{1.75 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = \frac{1.75}{1.5} = 1.1667 \text{ intervals}
\]

Now, since she reads 2 pages per interval:

\[
2 \text{ pages/interval} \times 1.1667 \text{ intervals} = 2.3334 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages Judy reads in the first week.
Multiply the number of pages per hour by the number of hours:

\[
2.3334 \text{ pages/hour} \times 1.75 \text{ hours} = 4.16685 \approx 4.167 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of pages Judy reads in the second week.
In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 6: Add the number of pages read in both weeks.
\[
4.167 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 104.167 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \( \boxed{104.167} \) pages.<|im_end|>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the total sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches in total:

\[ \text{Sandwiches Cody ate} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the number of sandwiches Cody ate from the total.
Subtract the 4 sandwiches that Cody ate from the original 12 sandwiches:

\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

So, after Cody ate his share, there are 8 sandwiches remaining.

### Step 3: Determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the total sandwiches:

\[ \text{Sandwiches Trevor ate} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the number of sandwiches Trevor ate from the remaining sandwiches.
Subtract the 3 sandwiches that Trevor ate from the 8 sandwiches left after Cody:

\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

### Conclusion:
After both Cody and Trevor have eaten their portions, there are 5 sandwiches left.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Shiloh's nephew is today given that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the current age of Shiloh's nephew.
   
2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   In 7 years, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old. His nephew will be \( x + 7 \) years old. According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This can be written as:
   \[
   51 = 3(x + 7)
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   First, simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   51 = 3x + 21
   \]
   Next, isolate \( x \):
   \[
   51 - 21 = 3x
   \]
   \[
   30 = 3x
   \]
   Finally, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 10

So, Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).<|im_end|>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Initial Deposit
First, we know that the tooth fairy deposited $5.00 in exchange for the first tooth Sharon lost. So, at this point:
\[ \text{Total deposited} = \$5.00 \]

### Step 2: Deposits for the Next Three Teeth
For the next three teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gives her $1.00 for each. Since there are three such deposits:
\[ \text{Deposit for next three teeth} = 3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00 \]
Adding these to the total:
\[ \text{New Total} = \$5.00 + \$3.00 = \$8.00 \]

### Step 3: Deposits for the Last Two Teeth
For the last two teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gives her half the amount of money she received from the previous three teeth. Since the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of those three teeth, we calculate:
\[ \text{Amount given per tooth (previous three)} = \$1.00 \]
So, for the last two teeth:
\[ \text{Deposit for last two teeth} = 2 \times \left(\frac{\$1.00}{2}\right) = 2 \times \$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \$1.00 \]
Adding these to the current total:
\[ \text{Final Total} = \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$9.00 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.00.
{The final answer is} \( \boxed{9.00} \)<|im_end|>","She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored and then sum these values.

1. **Determine Mark's Goals:**
   - We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Mark.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
     Therefore, \( M + 45 = 80 \).

2. **Solve for Mark's Goals:**
   \[
   M + 45 = 80 \\
   M = 80 - 45 \\
   M = 35
   \]
   So, Mark scored 35 goals.

3. **Determine Anna's Goals:**
   - We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.
     Therefore, \( A + 20 = 80 \).

4. **Solve for Anna's Goals:**
   \[
   A + 20 = 80 \\
   A = 80 - 20 \\
   A = 60
   \]
   So, Anna scored 60 goals.

5. **Sum the Goals:**
   - The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
     \[
     80 (\text{Richie}) + 35 (\text{Mark}) + 60 (\text{Anna})
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Sum:**
   \[

2. Determine how much he has left after spending in those three days.
3. Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.
4. Add the number of wooden action figures from the first three days to the number of plastic action figures bought.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter spends in the first three days.
- Each wooden action figure costs $5.
- He buys two wooden action figures per day (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday).
- So, in three days, he buys \(3 \times 2 = 6\) wooden action figures.
- The total cost for these is \(6 \times 5 = \$30\).

Step 2: Determine how much he has left after spending in those three days.
- Peter starts with $70.
- After spending $30, he has \(70 - 30 = \$40\) left.

Step 3: Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy with the remaining money.
- Each plastic action figure costs $2.
- With $40, he can buy \(40 / 2 = 20\) plastic action figures.

Step 4: Add the number of wooden action figures from the first three days to the number of plastic action figures bought.
- He already bought 6 wooden action figures.
- And he can now buy 20 more plastic action figures.
- Therefore, the total number of action figures is \(6 + 20 = 26\).

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 26 action figures.

To determine how much the kitten has cost so far, we need to calculate the cost of the spay, the vaccines, and the broken vases. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Spay Cost**: The spay cost Leah $200.
   - Step: Calculate the spay cost.

\[ \text{Spay Cost} = \$200 \]

2. **Vaccines Cost**: Each vaccine costs $20 and she needs 3 vaccines.
   - Step: Calculate the total cost for the vaccines.

\[ \text{Total Vaccine Cost} = 3 \times \$20 = \$60 \]

3. **Broken Vases Cost**: Each vase costs $12 and the kitten broke 4 vases.
   - Step: Calculate the total cost for the broken vases.

\[ \text{Total Broken Vase Cost} = 4 \times \$12 = \$48 \]

Now, let's sum up all these costs to find out the total amount spent on the kitten so far.

- Step: Add up the costs from the spay, vaccines, and broken vases.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Spay Cost} + \text{Total Vaccine Cost} + \text{Total Broken Vase Cost} \]

                    question:
                    Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 . roses every week. He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third ? flower shop orders 30 roses ; per week. ? How many roses does Ford lack to supply all the flower shops : every month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses supplied to all flower shops in one week.
- First flower shop orders 20 roses.
- Second flower shop orders 15 roses.
- Third flower shop orders 30 roses.

Total roses supplied in one week = \(20 + 15 + 30\)

\[ Total = 65 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many weeks there are in a month.
Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks (since we're calculating for one month).

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses required in one month.
Total roses required in one month = \(65\) roses/week × \(4\) weeks/month

\[ Total = 65 \times 4 \]

\[ Total = 260 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford actually grows in one month.
Ford grows 40 roses every week.

Total roses grown in one month = \(40\) roses/week × \(4\) weeks/month

\[ Total = 40 \times 4 \]

\[ Total = 160 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference between the roses needed and the roses grown.
Roses lacking = Total roses required - Total roses grown

\[ Roses lacking = 260 - 160 \]

\[ Roses lacking = 100 \]

### Conclusion:
Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

{The final answer is} 100 roses.<|im_end|>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of months in 2 years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, in 2 years, there are \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months.

2. **Calculate the total amount removed over 2 years:**
   - Katina removes $100 each month.
   - Over 24 months, the total removal would be \(24 \times \$100\).

3. **Subtract the total removal from the initial amount:**
   - Initial amount in the account: $3000.
   - Total removal over 2 years: \(24 \times \$100 = \$2400\).
   - Remaining amount after removing $2400: \(\$3000 - \$2400 = \$600\).

Therefore, the amount of money remaining within the account after 2 years is $\boxed{600}$.<|im_end|>","A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue from Sandwich Sales
- Each sandwich is sold for $7.00.
- They make 10 sandwiches.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Sandwiches} \times \text{Price per Sandwich}
\]

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost
- The cost of bread per loaf is $3.00.
- They use one loaf per sandwich.

\[
\text{Total Bread Cost} = \text{Cost per Loaf} \times \text{Number of Loaves Needed}
\]

Since they make 10 sandwiches, they will need 10 loaves (as stated in the problem).

\[
\text{Total Bread Cost} = \$3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00
\]

- Additionally, they spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Bread Cost} + \text{Total Cheese Condiment Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$30.00 + \$30.00 = \$60.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Net Profit
- Subtract total cost from total revenue.

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - \$60.00 = \$10.00
\]

### Conclusion
Their net profit is **$10.00**.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\$10.00}$<|im_end|>","They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of crayons available
- There are 3 boxes.
- Each box contains 64 crayons.

Total number of crayons = Number of boxes × Crayons per box
= 3 × 64
= 192 crayons

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of time needed to melt the crayons
- Each piece of crayon needs about 5 minutes to melt completely.

Total time (in minutes) = Total number of pieces × Time per piece
= 8 pieces × 5 minutes/piece
= 40 minutes

### Step 3: Convert the total time into hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
Time (in hours) = Total time (in minutes) / 60
= 40 minutes / 60
≈ 0.67 hours

### Step 4: Determine the cost of selling one muffin crayon
- Selling price per muffin crayon = $1.50

### Step 5: Calculate the profit from selling the muffin crayons
First, calculate the total revenue from selling the muffin crayons:
Revenue = Number of muffin crayons × Price per muffin crayon
Number of muffin crayons = 8 pieces/muffin × 1 muffin/crayon
Number of muffin crayons = 8 pieces/muffin × 1 muffin/crayon
Number of muffin crayons = 8 muffins

Revenue = 8 muffins × $1.50/muffin
Revenue = $12.00

Next, calculate the total cost:
Cost = Cost per muffin × Number of muffin crayons
Cost = $0.025 × 8 muffins
Cost = $0.20

Finally, calculate the profit:
Profit = Revenue - Cost
Profit = $12.00 - $0.20
Profit = $11.80

### Conclusion:
Kate can make a profit of **$11.80** by selling the muffin crayons.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to calculate the cost of removing the old carpet, installing the new carpet, and the additional cost for the padding.

**Step 1: Calculate the area of the room**
The room is 18 feet wide and 12 feet long.
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 18 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet**
The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.
\[ \text{Cost of removal} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$4/\text{square foot} = \$864 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the new carpet**
The new carpet costs $12 per square foot.
\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$12/\text{square foot} = \$2592 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the padding underneath the new carpet**
The padding costs $2 per square foot.
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 216 \, \text{square feet} \times \$2/\text{square foot} = \$432 \]

**Step 5: Add all costs together**
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of removal} + \text{Cost of new carpet} + \text{Cost of padding} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$864 + \$2592 + \$432 = \$3888 \]

Therefore, the total amount Michael will have to pay to replace the carpet is $3888.<|im_end|>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.

The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.
The total cost will be $864 + $2,592 + $432 + $7,344 = $11,232.

                    Mack wants to count things and decided to count how many birds there are in the sky over the next week. On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds. On day three he saw none. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six he saw 20 and on day , seven he saw 90. On average, how many birds did Mack see in a day?

To calculate the average number of birds Mack saw per day, follow these steps:

1. **Sum up all the birds seen**:
   - Day 1: 50 birds
   - Day 2: 50 birds
   - Day 3: 0 birds
   - Day 4: 120 birds
   - Day 5: 120 birds
   - Day 6: 20 birds
   - Day 7: 90 birds

   Total = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90

2. **Calculate the total sum**:
   \[
   50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 480
   \]

3. **Count the number of days**:
   There are 7 days.

4. **Divide the total number of birds by the number of days**:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Birds}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{480}{7}
   \]

5. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{480}{7} \approx 68.57
   \]

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack sees per day is approximately \(68.57\). Since we cannot have half a bird, this would be rounded down or up depending on context (though typically in such problems, it's common to report averages as whole numbers unless specified otherwise).

The final answer is: The final answer is \(68.57\) birds per day.<|im_end|>","On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions carefully.

### Step 1: Determine the initial calculation for the number train.
Given that the starting value of the number train is 20, and it's described as ""half"" the number being added to it:

\[ \text{Initial Calculation} = \frac{\text{Starting Value}}{2} + \text{Number Train} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Initial Calculation} = \frac{20}{2} + \text{Number Train} \]
\[ \text{Initial Calculation} = 10 + \text{Number Train} \]

### Step 2: Perform the division by 5 on the result from Step 1.
Now, divide the result obtained from the first step by 5:

\[ \text{Result After Division by 5} = \frac{\text{Initial Calculation}}{5} \]

Substitute the value calculated in Step 1 into this equation:

\[ \text{Result After Division by 5} = \frac{10 + \text{Number Train}}{5} \]

### Step 3: Multiply the result from Step 2 by the starting value.
Next, multiply the value obtained from the second step by the starting value (which is 20):

\[ \text{Final Result} = (\text{Result After Division by 5}) \times \text{Starting Value} \]

Substitute the values obtained so far:

\[ \text{Final Result} = \left( \frac{10 + \text{Number Train}}{5} \right) \times 20 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression.
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses before multiplying:

\[ \text{Final Result} = \left( \frac{10 + \text{Number Train}}{5} \right) \times 20 \]

Factor out the common factor:

\[ \text{Final Result} = \frac{(10 + \text{Number Train}) \cdot 20}{5} \]

Since \( 20 \div 5 = 4 \), we can simplify further:

\[ \text{Final Result} = 4 \times (10 + \text{Number Train}) \]

### Final Answer:
After performing all these steps, the final value of the number train is:

\[
\boxed{4 \times (10 + \text{Number Train})}

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct setting on Maggie's oven based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the current settings and temperatures:**
   - Current temperature setting: 450°F
   - Actual temperature when set to 450°F: 468°F

2. **Calculate the percentage error in the current setting:**
   - The difference between the desired temperature (450°F) and the actual temperature (468°F) is \( |468 - 450| = 18 \)°F.
   - The percentage error can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Desired Temperature}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \approx 4\%
     \]

3. **Determine the correct setting based on the given condition:**
   - According to the problem, the oven is off by the same percentage for any recipe. This means that the correct setting should still give an approximate temperature of 520°F after applying the same percentage error correction.
   - Let \( T_{correct} \) be the correct temperature setting.
   - Since the oven is off by 4% from 450°F to reach 468°F, the same 4% error will apply to 520°F.
   - Therefore, the formula to find the correct temperature setting \( T_{correct} \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     520 = 450 + 0.04 \times (T_{correct} - 450)
     \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     520 = 450 + 0.04 \times T_{correct}
     \]
     \[
     70 = 0.04 \times T_{correct}
     \]
     \[
     T_{correct} = \frac{70}{0.04} = 1750 \text{°F}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Maggie should set her oven to approximately 1750°F to ensure the temperature reaches 520°F after applying the same percentage error correction.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how many minutes Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert both movie lengths into minutes.
- **First Movie (1 hour and 30 minutes):**
  - There are 60 minutes in one hour.
  - Therefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes.
  
  Adding the additional 30 minutes:
  \[
  60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Second Movie (2 hours and 5 minutes):**
  - Again, there are 60 minutes in one hour.
  - So, 2 hours = \(2 \times 60\) minutes.

  Adding the additional 5 minutes:
  \[
  2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 2: Add the total minutes for both movies together.
\[
90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.<|im_end|>","One hour has 60 minutes.
The first movie is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 minutes long.
Two hours is equal to 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
The second movie is 120 + 5 = <<120+5=125>>125 minutes long.
Max will take 90 + 125 = <<90+125=215>>215 minutes to watch the two movies.

   - Herb bought the house for $76,000.

2. **Determine the value of Juan's house based on Herb's house price:**
   - Juan's house is described as ""30% less expensive"" than Herb's.
   
3. **Calculate 30% of Herb's house value:**
   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
   \]
   - This means Juan's house is $22,800 cheaper than Herb's.

4. **Subtract the discount from the original price to find the actual value of Juan's house:**
   \[
   76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
   \]

5. **Sum up the values of both houses to get the total combined value:**
   \[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy originally bought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen (12) cups.

2. **Calculate the number of dishes Judy bought initially:**
   - Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   - Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dishes.

3. **Calculate the total number of items Judy initially brought:**
   - The total number of items is the sum of the cups and dishes.
   - Total items = Cups + Dishes = 12 + 24 = 36 items.

4. **Account for the additional items found at the event:**
   - Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than she did.
   - Friend's cup count: 40 cups.
   - Friend's dish count: 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

5. **Calculate the total number of items brought by both Judy and her friend:**
   - Judy's total items before finding extra: 36 items.
   - Friend's total items after adding: 40 cups + 60 dishes = 100 items.
   - Combined total items = Judy's original items + Friend's new items = 36 + 100 = 136 items.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pairs of contacts Pete can buy:**
   - Pete has 90 single contacts.
   - Each pair consists of 2 contacts.

\[
\text{Total number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Number of single contacts}}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pairs}
\]

2. **Calculate the discounted price for one box of contacts:**
   - The original price of one box is $100.00.
   - There is a current discount of 10%.

\[
\text{Discounted price per box} = \text{Original price} \times (1 - \text{Discount rate}) = 100.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 100.00 \times 0.90 = 90.00
\]

3. **Calculate the total cost for two boxes at the discounted price:**
   - Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, we multiply the discounted price per box by 2.

\[
\text{Total cost for 2 boxes} = 2 \times \text{Discounted price per box} = 2 \times 90.00 = 180.00
\]

Therefore, if Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, each pair will cost him $\boxed{90}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off

                    question:
                    Tabitha agreed to pay John and Jill $10 an , hour to . help clean out her attic . and basement. ;  Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday ; and , 1 hour on : Sunday.  .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money John and Jill earned based on their work schedules. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's earnings

Jill worked for two days:
- On Saturday: 2 hours
- On Sunday: 1 hour

Since she earns $10 per hour, we can calculate her total earnings as follows:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = (\text{Hours on Saturday}) \times (\text{Hourly rate}) + (\text{Hours on Sunday}) \times (\text{Hourly rate})
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings} = (2 \times 10) + (1 \times 10)
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 20 + 10 = \$30
\]

So, Jill earned a total of $30.

### Step 2: Calculate John's earnings

John works twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long on Sunday.

Let’s denote Jill's working time in hours as \( T_J \). Therefore, John's working time will be:

- Saturday: \( 2T_J \)
- Sunday: \( 3T_J \)

Given that Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday, we find \( T_J \):

\[
2T_J = 2 \implies T_J = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

Now, let's calculate John's earnings:

**Saturday:**
\[
\text{Earnings on Saturday} = (2 \times 10) = \$20
\]

**Sunday:**
\[
\text{Earnings on Sunday} = (3 \times 10) = \$30
\]

Adding these together gives John's total earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$20 + \$30 = \$50
\]

### Step 3: Compare John's and Jill's earnings

Finally, we compare John's earnings to Jill's:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{John's earnings} - \text{Jill's earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = \$50 - \$30 = \$20
\]

Therefore, John earned $20 more than Jill.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is \(\boxed{\$20}\).<|im_end|>","Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.
Jill worked 3 hours at $10/hour so she made 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30

John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday so 3*1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours
John worked 4 hours + 3 hours for 7 hours
John worked 7 hours at $10/hour so he made 7*10 = $<<7*10=70>>70
John made $70 while Jill made $30 so $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 more dollars

                    question:
                    Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, and 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour. How many ml ? of water does she need to drink?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories burned:**
   - Aerobics burns 500 calories per hour.
   - Running burns 600 calories per hour.

   For 2 hours of aerobics:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
   \]

   For 1 hour of running:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
   \]

   Total calories burned:
   \[
   1000 \text{ calories (aerobics)} + 600 \text{ calories (running)} = 1600 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of water needed based on the given ratio:**
   According to the information provided, Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

3. **Set up the proportion to find out how much water is needed for 1600 calories:**
   Let \( x \) be the amount of water in milliliters that Hannah needs to drink.

   Given:
   \[
   \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1600}{200}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1600}{200} = 8
   \]
   
   Multiply both sides by 100 to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 8 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   x = 800
   \]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water.<|im_end|>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jelly beans.
   
2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so if we denote the number of red jelly beans as \( R \), then \( R = B - \frac{B}{100} \).
   - Similarly, the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so \( G = B + \frac{B}{100} \).

3. **Simplify the Equations:**
   - From \( R = B - \frac{B}{100} \), simplify to get \( R = \frac{99B}{100} \).
   - From \( G = B + \frac{B}{100} \), simplify to get \( G = \frac{101B}{100} \).

4. **Total Number of Jelly Beans Equation:**
   Since the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, we have:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]

5. **Substitute \( R \) and \( G \):**
   Substitute \( R \) and \( G \) from the simplified equations into the total equation:
   \[
   \frac{99B}{100} + B + \frac{101B}{100} = 4500
   \]
   Combine terms:
   \[
   \frac{99B + 100B + 101B}{100} = 4500
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{300B}{100} = 4500
   \]
   Further simplification gives:
   \[
   3B = 4500
   \]
   Solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
   \]

6. **Calculate Red and Green Jelly Beans:**
   - Blue jelly beans (B) = 1500.
   - Red jelly beans (R) = \( \frac{99}{100} \times 1500 = 1485 \).
   - Green jelly beans (G) = \( \frac{101}{100} \times 1500 = 1515 \).

7. **Find the Difference Between Green and Red Jelly Beans:**
   - Difference between green and red jelly beans = \( 1515 - 1485 = 30 \).

Therefore, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

**The final answer is:** 30<|im_end|>","If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans

After some ? lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased , to 52 WPM.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Typing Speed:**
   Jared starts at 47 words per minute.

2. **First Increase in Typing Speed:**
   After one lesson, his typing speed increases to 52 words per minute.
   
3. **Second Increase in Typing Speed:**
   Jared decides to increase his typing speed again but only by 5 words per minute. Since his current speed after the first increase is already 52 words per minute, increasing it by just 5 words would result in a total increase of \(52 + 5 = 57\) words per minute.

Now, let's calculate the new typing speeds for each step:

- Initial typing speed: 47 WPM
- After the first increase: 52 WPM
- After the second increase: 57 WPM

Next, we need to find the average of these three measurements.

4. **Calculate the Average:**
   The average can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all measurements}}{\text{Number of measurements}}
   \]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
\]

Let's perform the addition inside the numerator:
\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then divide by 3:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52

                    If Martin eats Cheerios every day for . breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 : pounds/week. If ! he eats , donuts every day for . breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What . will be the difference in his weight at the ? end of 5 : weeks between ; the two breakfast options?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly weight change due to Cheerios
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week if he eats Cheerios.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss would be \( 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \) pounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly weight change due to Donuts
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week if he eats Donuts.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain would be \( 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \) pounds.

### Step 3: Determine the net effect on weight over 5 weeks
- To find out how much Martin's weight changes over 5 weeks, we subtract the total weight gain from the total weight loss.
\[ \text{Net Weight Change} = (\text{Total Weight Loss}) - (\text{Total Weight Gain}) \]
\[ \text{Net Weight Change} = (6.25) - (8.75) = -2.50 \]

### Step 4: Conclude the final answer
- The negative value indicates that Martin's overall weight will decrease by 2.50 pounds after 5 weeks.

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is {The final answer is}: **-2.50** pounds.<|im_end|>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many seats Alex needs, let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people via email.
   
2. **Invitation Spread:**
   - Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 more friends.
     - Number of additional invitations from these 100 people = \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \).

3. **Total Initial Invitees Including Spouses:**
   - Total number of invitees (including those who bring spouses) = \( 100 + 200 = 300 \).

4. **Additional Invitations Called by Friends:**
   - Alex calls 10 friends to invite others.
     
5. **Spouse Invitations from Called Friends:**
   - Out of the 10 called friends, 8 will bring their spouses.
     - Number of spouse invitations from these 10 friends = \( 8 \).
     
6. **Total Spouse Invitations:**
   - Since only one spouse per invitation can fit in the venue, we assume that each of these 8 invitations results in just one spouse being invited.

7. **Calculate Total Seats Needed:**
   - The total number of people attending the event = \( 300 + 8 = 308 \).

Therefore, Alex will need 308 seats at the event.<|im_end|>","Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.

Out of her friends, 8 people said that they will be bringing their spouse, so this is a total of 10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 people.
Including her own seat, Alex is going to need a total of 300 + 18 +1 = <<300+18+1=319>>319 seats.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for both websites.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at Amazon.com
- Cost per pair of boots: $16
- Shipping cost (Amazon): $4

Total cost at Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
= $16 + $4
= $20

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at eBay
- Cost per pair of boots: $13
- Shipping cost (eBay) = Twice the shipping cost at Amazon

First, find the shipping cost at eBay:
Shipping cost at eBay = 2 × Shipping cost at Amazon
= 2 × $4
= $8

Now, add the cost of the boots and the shipping cost to get the total cost at eBay:
Total cost at eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
= $13 + $8
= $21

### Step 3: Determine the difference in price between eBay and Amazon
Difference in price = Total cost at eBay - Total cost at Amazon
= $21 - $20
= $1

### Final Answer
The boots from eBay work out to be $1 more expensive than those from Amazon. {The final answer is} $1.<|im_end|>","The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20

                    Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is . 20 ; feet off . the ! ground. The beanstalk doubles its , height ! every day. If the beanstalk starts out 4 feet ; tall, ; how many days will , it take ! to be . taller than Mark's window?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to exceed Mark's window height, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.
2. **Height Increase Rate**: The height increases by doubling each day.

Let's denote:
- \( h_0 \) as the initial height (4 feet),
- \( h_n \) as the height after n days,
- \( d \) as the number of days required to exceed the window height.

Given that the height doubles daily, the height on any given day can be represented as follows:
\[ h_{n+1} = h_n \times 2 \]

We want to find the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[ h_n > 20 \text{ feet} \]

Starting from the initial height:
\[ h_0 = 4 \text{ feet} \]

On Day 1:
\[ h_1 = h_0 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

On Day 2:
\[ h_2 = h_1 \times 2 = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ feet} \]

Since the height exceeds 20 feet on Day 2, no further calculations are needed beyond this point because the next day would double the current height again.

Therefore, it takes **2 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window. 

\[
\boxed{\text{2 days}}
\]<|im_end|>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet

To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the total amount of protein in the mushrooms John consumes.
2. Calculate the daily protein intake based on the weight of the mushrooms consumed.
3. Convert the daily protein intake into weekly protein intake.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Total Protein from Mushrooms
Given that the mushrooms weigh 100 grams and contain 3 grams of protein per gram, we can calculate the total protein content as follows:

\[ \text{Total protein} = \text{Weight of mushrooms} \times \text{Protein per gram} \]
\[ \text{Total protein} = 100 \, \text{grams} \times 3 \, \text{grams/gram} \]
\[ \text{Total protein} = 300 \, \text{grams} \]

So, John gets 300 grams of protein from the mushrooms he consumes.

### Step 2: Daily Protein Intake
John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets from these mushrooms each day, we use the same calculation as before:

\[ \text{Daily protein intake} = \text{Weight of mushrooms} \times \text{Protein per gram} \]
\[ \text{Daily protein intake} = 200 \, \text{grams} \times 3 \, \text{grams/gram} \]
\[ \text{Daily protein intake} = 600 \, \text{grams} \]

So, John gets 600 grams of protein each day.

### Step 3: Weekly Protein Intake
Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily protein intake by 7 to find out how much protein John gets in a week:

\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = \text{Daily protein intake} \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 600 \, \text{grams/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} \]
\[ \text{Weekly protein intake} = 4200 \, \text{grams} \]

Therefore, John gets **4200 grams** of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day.<|im_end|>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day
So that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day
So he gets 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 grams of protein per week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

1. **Step 1: Establish the relationship between Jerry’s current age and his age five years ago.**
   - According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago.
   - Let \( A_0 = J \) represent Jerry's age 5 years ago.

2. **Step 2: Write an equation based on the given relationship.**
   - Since Jerry is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago, we can write:
     \[
     J = 2A_0
     \]
   - Substituting \( A_0 = J \):
     \[
     J = 2J
     \]

3. **Step 3: Solve for \( J \).**
   - From the equation \( J = 2J \), it becomes clear that there is no positive solution for \( J \) if \( J \) represents a person's age.
   - Therefore, there must be an error or misinterpretation in the setup of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the interpretation of the problem statement.

4. **Re-evaluation Step: Interpret the problem correctly.**
   - The correct interpretation should be: ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.""
   - So, if \( J \) is Jerry's current age, then \( J \) is also twice \( A_0 \).
   - Hence, \( J = 2A_0 \).

5. **Step 4: Determine Jerry's current age.**
   - We know from the previous steps that \( J = 2A_0 \).
   - If we assume \( A_0 \) (his age 5 years ago) is some number, let's say \( A_0 = x \), then:
     \[
     J = 2x
     \]

6. **Step 5: Calculate Jerry's age in 3 years.**
   - Currently, Jerry is \( J \) years old.
   - In 3 years, he will be:
     \[
     J + 3
     \]

7. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - Since we don't have specific values for \( J \) or \( A_0 \), we cannot determine a numerical value for \( J + 3 \) without additional information about his age 5 years ago.
   - However, if we had \( J \), we would add 3 to it to find his age in 3 years.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}?<|im_end|>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5

To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover the cost of his dental work, let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the implants.
George needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000.

- Cost of 2 implants = \( 2 \times \$2000 = \$4000 \)

### Step 2: Determine the additional cost for the crowns.
For one of the implants, George wants a crown made of porcelain. The cost of this extra feature is an additional $500.

- Additional cost for one implant = $500

Since there are two implants, we calculate the total extra cost as follows:

- Total extra cost for all implants = \( 2 \times \$500 = \$1000 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the dental work.
Total cost of the dental work = Cost of implants + Extra cost for crowns

- Total cost = \( \$4000 + \$1000 = \$5000 \)

### Step 4: Determine how much more money George needs.
He has already deposited $600 towards his dental work.

- Remaining amount needed = Total cost - Deposit
- Remaining amount needed = \( \$5000 - \$600 = \$4400 \)

### Step 5: Calculate the number of hours George needs to work.
George earns $15 per hour.

- Number of hours needed to earn $4400 = \( \frac{\$4400}{\$15} \)

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{4400}{15} = 293.\overline{3} \]

### Final Answer:
George needs to work approximately **293.33** hours to have enough money to cover the remaining cost of his dental work.<|im_end|>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \).

2. **Express Other Angles in Terms of \( x \):**
   - The second angle is given as twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \).
   - The third angle is given as three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \).

3. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**
   The sum of all angles in any triangle must be \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles as:
   \[
   x + 2x + 3x = 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   6x = 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to find the value of \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{180^\circ}{6} = 30^\circ
   \]
   So, the smallest angle \( x \) is \( 30^\circ \).

6. **Determine the Measures of the Other Angles:**
   - The second angle is \( 2x \), which is \( 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \).
   - The third angle is \( 3x \), which is \( 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ \).

7. **Identify the Largest Angle:**
   Among the angles calculated (30°, 60°, and 90°), the largest angle is \( 90^\circ \).

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \( 90^\circ \).

**Final Answer:**

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Colby has:**
   - Colby has 8 quarters.
     \[
     8 \text{ quarters} = 8 \times \$0.25 = \$2.00
     \]
   - Colby also has 6 dimes.
     \[
     6 \text{ dimes} = 6 \times \$0.10 = \$0.60
     \]
   - Colby has 14 nickels.
     \[
     14 \text{ nickels} = 14 \times \$0.05 = \$0.70
     \]
   - Colby has 15 pennies.
     \[
     15 \text{ pennies} = 15 \times \$0.01 = \$0.15
     \]

2. **Sum up all the amounts:**
   \[
   \$2.00 + \$0.60 + \$0.70 + \$0.15 = \$3.45
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of one gumball:**
   - Each gumball costs 1 cent (which is $0.01).

4. **Divide the total amount of money by the cost per gumball:**
   \[
   \frac{\$3.45}{\$0.01} = 345
   \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 345 gumballs.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 345.<|im_end|>","He has $2 in quarters because 8 times .25 equals <<8*.25=2>>2.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for all the pets in the store. We will consider the different types of animals (dogs, cats, and birds) separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for dogs
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- There are 5 dogs in the store.

\[
\text{Total legs for dogs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Legs per dog}
\]

\[
\text{Total legs for dogs} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of legs for cats
- Each cat has 4 legs.
- There are 2 cats in the store.

\[
\text{Total legs for cats} = \text{Number of cats} \times \text{Legs per cat}
\]

\[
\text{Total legs for cats} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of legs for birds
- Each bird has 2 legs.
- There are 10 birds in the store.

\[
\text{Total legs for birds} = \text{Number of birds} \times \text{Legs per bird}
\]

\[
\text{Total legs for birds} = 10 \times 2 = 20
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the legs from dogs, cats, and birds
Now, add the total legs for each type of animal:

\[
\text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs for dogs} + \text{Total legs for cats} + \text{Total legs for birds}
\]

\[
\text{Total legs} = 20 + 8 + 20 = 48
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of legs that the pets in the store have is \( \boxed{48} \).<|im_end|>","The dogs have 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = <<5*4=20>>20 legs.

To determine the weight Jamaal now uses after his adjustments, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.
2. **Increase the Weight**: He increases this weight by 50%.
   - Calculation: \(8 \times 1.5 = 12\). So, the increased weight is 12 pounds.
3. **Adjustment for Too Heavy Weight**: He then reduces this weight by 2 pounds because it's still too heavy.
   - Calculation: \(12 - 2 = 10\).

Therefore, the weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Initial Setup**
- **Number of games initially received on his birthday:** 5 games.

**Step 2: Games bought in the first year (monthly at $1):**
- **Monthly cost:** $1.
- **Total months in one year:** 12.
- **Total spent in the first year:** \( 1 \times 12 = \$12 \).

So, at the end of the first year:
\[ 5 + 12 = 17 \text{ games} \]

**Step 3: Games bought in the second year (monthly at $1):**
- **Total spent in the second year:** \( 1 \times 12 = \$12 \).

So, at the end of the second year:
\[ 17 + 12 = 29 \text{ games} \]

**Step 4: Games bought in the third year (monthly at $1):**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the plane to travel 2000 miles at its current rate. We can do this by first finding the speed of the plane.

### Step 1: Calculate the Speed of the Plane
Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the speed (rate) using the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} \]

Simplify the fraction:

\[ \text{Speed} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the plane's speed is 400 miles per hour.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Required to Travel Additional Miles
Now that we know the speed of the plane, we can find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} \]

Simplify the division:

\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much Ruiz can make per hour
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.

First, find out how much he can make per hour:
\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much Marissa can make per hour
Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates per hour as Ruiz does in 2 hours.

So, first we need to determine how many pounds Ruiz makes per hour (which we already calculated):
\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, calculate Marissa’s hourly rate:
\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]
\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolates made by both in one hour
Add their rates together:
\[ \text{Total per hour} = 60 + 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]
\[ \text{Total per hour} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of chocolates made in 12 hours
Multiply their combined hourly rate by the number of working hours:
\[ \text{Total chocolates in 12 hours} = 105 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total chocolates in 12 hours} = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Patrick earned over the total period (4 hours + 2 hours). We will break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 15 cups/hour
- **Price per cup**: $0.50

First, find out how many cups Patrick sold in 4 hours:

\[
\text{Cups sold in 4 hours} = 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the revenue from these sales:

\[
\text{Revenue from 4 hours} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 10 cups/hour
- **Price per cup**: $0.60

Now, find out how many cups Patrick sold in the remaining 2 hours:

\[
\text{Cups sold in 2 hours} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the revenue from these sales:

\[
\text{Revenue from 2 hours} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12
\]

### Step 3: Add both amounts together
Finally, add the revenue from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours to get the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \$30 + \$12 = \$42
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:

\[ \boxed{\$42} \]<|im_end|>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.

He earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.
So for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
Therefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per mile**

Given that every 2 miles the tires rotate 725 times, we need to find out how many rotations occur in one mile.

\[
\text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5
\]

So, each tire rotates 362.5 times for every mile driven.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rotations Jeremy makes in 400 miles**

Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we multiply the number of miles he drives by the number of rotations per mile.

\[
\text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \times 362.5 = 145,000
\]

Therefore, Jeremy makes 145,000 rotations per month.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of rotations Jeremy will make over the course of a year**

There are approximately 12 months in a year. So, we multiply the monthly rotations by 12.

\[
\text{Total rotations per year} = 145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000
\]

Thus, Jeremy will make 1,740,000 rotations in a year.

**Step 4: Calculate the time until the tire needs replacement based on the total number of rotations allowed**

Each tire can withstand up to 10,440,000 rotations. We divide the total rotations allowed by the total rotations Jeremy will make in a year.

\[
\text{Years until replacement} = \frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} \approx 6
\]

So, after approximately 6 years, the tire would need to be replaced.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The tire needs to be replaced after approximately 6 years}.<|im_end|>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles

So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

     \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\$24.00}{\text{Total washes}} = \frac{\$24.00}{60}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost per wash} = \$0.40
     \]

4. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Since the total cost of $24.00 covers 60 washes, the cost per pump (which gives one wash) is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\$24.00}{60} = \$0.40
     \]

5. **Convert the cost per pump from dollars to cents:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert $0.40 to cents:
     \[
     \$0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ cents}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Each pump costs 40 cents. 

**The final answer is:** 
The final answer is 40 cents.<|im_end|>","2 pumps will give you 120 washes so if she only uses 1 pump per wash she doubles the number of washes so she now has 120*2 = <<120*2=240>>240 washes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost before any discounts.
2. Apply the discount (30%) to find the discounted total.
3. Add the cost of the items to determine the total amount spent.
4. Subtract the total amount spent from Joe's initial $50.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discounts
- Cost of the shirt: $25
- Cost of the shorts: $35

Total cost before discounts = $25 + $35 = $60

### Step 2: Apply the discount
- Discount rate: 30%
- Discounted total = Total cost before discounts × (1 - discount rate)

Discounted total = $60 × (1 - 0.30) = $60 × 0.70 = $42

### Step 3: Add the cost of the items to determine the total amount spent
- Cost of the shirt: $25
- Cost of the shorts: $35

Total amount spent = $42 + ($25 + $35) = $42 + $60 = $102

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from Joe's initial $50
- Initial amount: $50
- Amount spent: $102

Amount left = Initial amount - Amount spent = $50 - $102 = -$52

Since the result is negative, it means Joe does not have enough money to cover the total cost of the items after the discount. 

Therefore, Joe will not be able to make the purchase as he only has $50 and the total cost of the items is $102. 

{The final answer is} Joe will not have enough money to make the purchase.<|im_end|>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

To determine how much butter Juan needs, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of dozen croissants needed**
Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissons every day for a week (7 days). Therefore, the total number of dozen croissons required is:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen croissons} \]

**Step 2: Determine the amount of butter needed per dozen croissons**
It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make one dozen croissons.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of butter needed for all the croissons**
Now that we know the total number of dozen croissons and the amount of butter needed per dozen, we can calculate the total amount of butter required:
\[ 28 \text{ dozen croissons} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Juan will need **7 pounds of butter** to make the croissons for a week.<|im_end|>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the additional cost required to repave both streets and then determine how much more it would cost for Monica's street compared to Lewis'. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost to repave both streets.
- The cost to repave one meter of street is $194.
- Monica's street is 150 meters long.

First, let's find the total cost to repave Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost for Monica} = 150 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost to repave Lewis' street (which is 490 meters long):
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis} = 490 \text{ meters} \times \$194/\text{meter} \]

### Step 2: Perform the calculations.
Let's start with Monica's street:
\[ \text{Cost for Monica} = 150 \times 194 = 28,700 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost for Lewis':
\[ \text{Cost for Lewis} = 490 \times 194 = 96,380 \]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between the two streets.
Now, subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis':
\[ \text{Additional Cost} = \text{Cost for Lewis} - \text{Cost for Monica} \]
\[ \text{Additional Cost} = 96,380 - 28,700 \]

### Final Calculation:
\[ \text{Additional Cost} = 67,680 \]

Therefore, it would cost $67,680 more to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street. {The final answer is} $67,680.<|im_end|>","Total cost to repave Monica’s street is 194*150 = <<194*150=29100>>29,100 dollars.

                    question:
                    John decides to build . a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  : His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to calculate the funding required over time, considering the doubling rate. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Funding for the First 5 Months
John initially receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. Since he doubles this amount every subsequent month, we can represent the funding as follows:

- Month 1: $100,000
- Month 2: $100,000 * 2 = $200,000
- Month 3: $200,000 * 2 = $400,000
- Month 4: $400,000 * 2 = $800,000
- Month 5: $800,000 * 2 = $1,600,000

Total funding for the first 5 months:
\[ \text{Total} = \$100,000 + \$200,000 + \$400,000 + \$800,000 + \$1,600,000 \]

Let’s sum these amounts:
\[ \$100,000 + \$200,000 = \$300,000 \]
\[ \$300,000 + \$400,000 = \$700,000 \]
\[ \$700,000 + \$800,000 = \$1,500,000 \]
\[ \$1,500,000 + \$1,600,000 = \$3,100,000 \]

So, the total funding for the first 5 months is $3,100,000.

### Step 2: Calculate the Funding for Subsequent Months
After the first 5 months, John doubles the previous month’s funding each month. The total funding for each subsequent month will be calculated using the formula for compound interest or exponential growth.

Let \( F_n \) be the funding in month \( n \). Then,
\[ F_6 = 3,100,000 \times 2 \]
\[ F_7 = F_6 \times 2 = 3,100,000 \times 2^2 \]
\[ F_8 = F_7 \times 2 = 3,100,000 \times 2^3 \]
\[ \vdots \]
\[ F_{n+5} = F_n \times 2^{n+4} \]

We can see that the pattern continues until all 10 months have been covered. Therefore, we need to sum the funding from the sixth month onward:

\[
F_{n+5} = 3,100,000 \times 2^n
\]

Summing up the funding from the sixth month to the tenth month gives us:
\[ F_6 = 3,100,000 \times 2^5 \]
\[ F_7 = 3,100,000 \times 2^6 \]
\[ F_8 = 3,100,000 \times 2^7 \]
\[ F_9 = 3,100,000 \times 2^8 \]
\[ F_{10} = 3,100,000 \times 2^9 \]

Calculate each term:
\[ F_6 = 3,100,000 \times 32 \]
\[ F_7 = 3,100,000 \times 64 \]
\[ F_8 = 3,100,000 \times 128 \]
\[ F_9 = 3,100,000 \times 256 \]
\[ F_{10} = 3,100,000 \times 512 \]

Now, let's add them together:
\[ F_6 + F_7 + F_8 + F_9 + F_{10} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ 3,100,000 \times (32 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 512) \]

Calculate inside the parentheses:
\[ 32 + 64 +","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the amount of meat each person ate:**
   - First player: 6 ounces of steak.
   - Second player: Beef tips (each contains 8 ounces, but we need to know how many pieces they get from the total weight). Let's assume each piece weighs 2 ounces (a common assumption for small-sized servings).
     - Number of pieces = Total weight / Piece weight = 8 ounces / 2 ounces per piece = 4 pieces.
     - Therefore, the second player ate 4 * 2 ounces = 8 ounces of beef tips.
   - Third player: One pound of steak.
     - Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, 1 pound = 16 ounces.
   - Fourth and Fifth Players: Vegetarian meals.

2. **Sum up all the amounts of meat eaten:**
   - First player: 6 ounces.
   - Second player: 8 ounces.
   - Third player: 16 ounces.
   - Fourth and Fifth Players: They didn't eat any meat.

3. **Calculate the total number of ounces of meat consumed:**
   - Total = 6 + 8 + 16 = 20 ounces.

Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{20} ounces.<|im_end|>","The second player consumed 8 1-ounce beef tips, for a total weight of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 ounces.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many loads of laundry Gary does per week.
Gary does laundry twice a week.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used per week.
Each load uses 20 gallons of water. Since he does laundry twice a week, we can calculate the weekly water usage as follows:
\[ \text{Weekly Water Usage} = 2 \times 20 \text{ gallons} = 40 \text{ gallons} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water used in a year.
There are approximately 52 weeks in a year. So, to find out how much water Gary uses in a year, we multiply his weekly water usage by 52:
\[ \text{Annual Water Usage} = 40 \text{ gallons/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} \]
\[ \text{Annual Water Usage} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the water used in a year.
Water costs $0.15 per gallon. To find out the total cost of the water Gary uses in a year, we multiply the annual water usage by the cost per gallon:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times \$0.15/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$312 \]

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to track the growth of the beanstalk over three weeks. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Height
After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.

\[ \text{Height at Week 1} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 2: Growth during the Second Week
In the second week, the beanstalk doubles its height from the previous week.

\[ \text{Height at Week 2} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 3: Additional Growth during the Third Week
In the third week, the beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches.

\[ \text{Height at Week 3} = 6 + 4 = 10 \text{ inches} \]

### Final Answer
After 3 weeks, the height of the beanstalk is **10 inches**.<|im_end|>","It was 3 inches tall after the first week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how long it will take Prince to sell all the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Prince's daily meat sales.
Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour and works for 10 hours a day.

\[
\text{Daily Meat Sales} = \text{Meat per Hour} \times \text{Hours Per Day}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Daily Meat Sales} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat in Bill’s bull.
Bill’s bull weighs 750 kg.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days required to sell all the meat.
We know Prince can sell 150 kg of meat per day.

\[
\text{Number of Days} = \frac{\text{Total Meat}}{\text{Daily Sales}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Number of Days} = \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
\]

### Conclusion:
It will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{5}<|im_end|>","In a day Bill sells 15 * 10 = <<15*10=150>>150kg of meat.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium**

- The auditorium has 4 rows.
- Each row has 18 seats.

Total number of seats = Number of rows × Seats per row
= 4 × 18
= 72 seats

**Step 2: Determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators**

- One-fourth (1/4) of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

Number of seats occupied by administrators = Total number of seats / 4
= 72 / 4
= 18 seats

**Step 3: Calculate the number of seats that remained after accounting for the administrators**

Remaining seats = Total number of seats - Seats occupied by administrators
= 72 - 18
= 54 seats

**Step 4: Determine how many of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents**

- One-third (1/3) of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

Seats occupied by parents = Remaining seats / 3
= 54 / 3
= 18 seats

**Step 5: Calculate the number of seats left for the students**

Seats occupied by students = Remaining seats - Seats occupied by parents
= 54 - 18
= 36 seats

**Final Answer**
Therefore, the number of students in the school auditorium is **36**.<|im_end|>","There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of street lights:**
   - Each pole has 4 street lights.
   - There are 6 poles per intersection.
   - The road has 4 intersections.

   First, find the total number of street lights in one intersection:
   \[
   \text{Street lights per pole} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Poles per intersection} = 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total street lights per intersection} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

   Now, multiply this by the number of intersections to get the total number of street lights for all intersections combined:
   \[
   \text{Total street lights} = 24 \times 4 = 96
   \]

2. **Determine the number of non-working street lights:**
   - We know that 20 streetlights are not working.

3. **Calculate the number of working street lights:**
   - Subtract the number of non-working street lights from the total number of street lights:

To determine how many more times each DVD can be played before breaking, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining playtime for the first DVD:**
   - Total playtime before breaking = 1000 times.
   - Times already used = 356 times.

2. **Subtract the number of plays from the total playtime:**

\[
1000 \text{ (total)} - 356 \text{ (used)} = 644 \text{ (remaining)}
\]

So, the first DVD still has 644 more times left to play.

3. **Calculate the remaining playtime for the second DVD:**
   - Times already used = 135 times.

4. **Subtract the number of plays from the total playtime:**

\[
1000 \text{ (total)} - 135 \text{ (used)} = 865 \text{ (remaining)}

To determine the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of hours spent in therapy:**
   - John goes to therapy twice per week.
   - Each session lasts for 2 hours.

   Therefore, the total number of hours spent on therapy over 6 weeks is calculated as follows:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = (\text{Sessions per Week}) \times (\text{Hours per Session}) \times (\text{Number of Weeks})
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = (2) \times (2) \times (6)
   \]

   Simplifying this:

   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost based on the hourly rate:**
   - The cost per hour is $125.

   Therefore, the total cost can be found by multiplying the total hours by the hourly rate:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Hours} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 24 \times 125

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces Jim chews during the school day:**
   - Jim chews 1 piece of gum every 2 hours.
   - The school day lasts 8 hours.

   \[
   \text{Total pieces chewed} = \frac{8\, \text{hours}}{2\, \text{hours per piece}} = 4\, \text{pieces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pieces Jim chews in total throughout the day:**
   - In addition to chewing during school, Jim chews:
     - 1 piece on the way home from school,
     - 1 stick (which we assume equals 5 pieces) after dinner.

   \[
   \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 + 1 + 5 = 10\, \text{pieces}
   \]

3. **Account for the pieces given away to his sister:**
   - Jim gives half of what he has remaining to his sister.

   Since he started with 20 packs of gum, which equate to \(20 \times 100 = 2000\) pieces, and he gave away half:

   \[
   \text{Pieces given away} = \frac{2000}{2} = 1000\, \text{pieces}
   \]

4. **Subtract the given pieces from the total pieces chewed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 2000 - 1000 = 1000\, \text{pieces}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of the day, Jim has \(\boxed{1000}\) pieces of gum left.<|im_end|>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum

His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum

   - To find her current age, we subtract 12 years from the future age (16).
   
   \[
   \text{Current Age} = 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate Her Age 4 Years From Now:**
   - Since we have determined that Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we add 4 years to her current age.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To find out Ashley's internet connection speed in megabytes per hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the given internet speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s)**.
2. **Calculate the total number of seconds in one hour**.
3. **Divide the obtained speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour**.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Convert kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per second (Mb/s)
We know that \(1 \text{ Mb} = 1000 \text{ kb}\). Therefore, to convert kilobytes per second to megabytes per second, we divide by 1000.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in Kb/s}}{1000} \]

Given:
- Speed in Kb/s = 20

So,
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of seconds in one hour
There are 60 minutes in one hour, and each minute contains 60 seconds. Thus, there are \(60 \times 60\) seconds in one hour.

\[ \text{Seconds in one hour} = 60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds} \]

### Step 3: Divide the obtained speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour
Now, we have the internet speed in Mb/s, so we will use this value to calculate how many Megabytes per hour it can be downloaded.

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times \text{Number of seconds in one hour} \]
\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \times 3600 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Megabytes per hour.

                    question:
                    ? On a particular week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days ! and then four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Calculate , the total number of cars it towed that week.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the total number of cars towed over the course of one week.

1. **First Three Days:**
   - The truck pulled 10 cars per day for the first three days.
   - Number of cars on the first three days = \(3 \times 10\).

2. **Remaining Days:**
   - There are seven days in a week (Monday to Sunday).
   - Subtracting the first three days from the total gives us five remaining days.
   - On these remaining days, the truck pulled 4 fewer cars than the first three days.
   
3. **Calculate Cars on Remaining Days:**
   - Since there were 10 cars per day on the first three days, reducing this by 4 means pulling \(10 - 4\) cars per day on the remaining days.
   - Number of cars on the remaining days = \(5 \times (10 - 4)\).

Let's perform the calculations:

1. **Cars on First Three Days:**
\[3 \times 10 = 30\]

2. **Cars on Remaining Days:**
\[5 \times (10 - 4) = 5 \times 6 = 30\]

Finally, let’s add up all the cars:

Total cars = Cars on first three days + Cars on remaining days
Total cars = \(30 + 30 = 60\)

Therefore, the total number of cars the tow truck pulled during that week is {The final answer is} 60.<|im_end|>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many years it will take for Adam to reach the required height to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the minimum height requirement:**
   - The roller coaster requires a height of 4 feet.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet is equivalent to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches.

2. **Calculate the current height difference:**
   - Adam's current height is 40 inches.
   - To find out how much taller he needs to be, subtract his current height from the minimum height requirement: 
     \[
     48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine the annual growth rate:**
   - Adam grows 2 inches per year.

4. **Set up an equation to solve for the number of years needed:**
   Let \(x\) represent the number of years until Adam reaches the required height. The equation can be set up as follows:
   \[
   40 + 2x = 48
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x = 48 - 40
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster. 

**The final answer is:**  
The final answer is 4 years.<|im_end|>","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the amount paid for acquiring the cars.
The company pays 30% of the sale price to acquire the cars.

\[
\text{Cost per car} = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost (for all cars)} = 10 \times \$7,500 = \$75,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the profit made from selling the cars.
Subtract the total acquisition cost from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the commission on the profits.
James earns a 10% commission on the profits.

\[
\text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, James made a total of **$175,000** after accounting for both his earnings from the sales and his commission on the profits. {The final answer is} $175,000.<|im_end|>","He sold the car for 25000*10=$<<25000*10=250000>>250,000

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on waves over 30 feet:**
   - We know that 25% of the total riders can stay upright.
   
   Let's denote the total number of riders as \( T \).
   
   Given \( T = 100 \).

   So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
   \[
   \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of women among those who can stay upright:**
   - We are given that 60% of these riders are women.

   Therefore, the number of women who can stay upright is:
   \[
   \text{Number of women who can stay upright} = 0.60 \times 25 = 15
   \]

3. **Find the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - Since the total number of riders who can stay upright is 25, and we already know the number of women who can stay upright (15), the remaining must be men.

   The number of men who can stay upright is:
   \[
   \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the price of a gold Jewel:**
   - According to the information given, the price of a gold Jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond Jewel.
   - Let \(P_d\) represent the price of a diamond Jewel.
   - Given \(P_d = \$2000\).
   - Therefore, the price of a gold Jewel (\(P_g\)) can be calculated as:
     \[
     P_g = \frac{4}{5} \times P_d = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \$1600
     \]

2. **Calculate the price of a silver Jewel:**
   - It is stated that the cost of a silver Jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewel.
   - Thus, the price of a silver Jewel (\(P_s\)) can be calculated as:
     \[
     P_s = P_g - 400 = 1600 - 400 = \$1200
     \]

3. **Sum up the prices of all three jewels:**
   - Now we have the prices of a gold, a diamond, and a silver Jewel.
   - Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is:
     \[
     Total = P_g + P_d + P_s = 1600 + 2000 + 1200 = \$4800

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define the number of stamps Max bought for each type:
- \( S \) = Number of snowflake stamps
- \( T \) = Number of truck stamps
- \( R \) = Number of rose stamps

Given information:
- \( S = 16 \)
- \( T = S + 3 \)
- \( R = T - 9 \)

### Step 2: Substitute Given Values
Substitute \( S = 16 \) into the equations for \( T \) and \( R \):
- \( T = 16 + 3 \)
- \( T = 19 \)
- \( R = 19 - 9 \)
- \( R = 10 \)

So now we have:
- Snowflake stamps (\( S \)) = 16
- Truck stamps (\( T \)) = 19
- Rose stamps (\( R \)) = 10

### Step 3: Calculate Total Stamps
Now that we know the total number of each type of stamp, we can find the total number of stamps Max bought:
\[ \text{Total stamps} = S + T + R \]
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 16 + 19 + 10 \]

### Step 4: Perform the Addition
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 16 + 19 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Total stamps} = 45 \]

To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed = 55 mph
   - Tom's speed = 70 mph
   - Relative speed (speed at which Tom is gaining on Bob) = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

2. **Determine the distance between them initially:**
   - Distance = 0.75 miles

3. **Use the formula for time:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many fish Darren caught.
We know that Naomi caught 17 fish.

Let \( N \) represent the number of fish Naomi caught.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the maximum number of classes Manny can afford without exceeding $10 per class.
- The cost per class is $60.
- If the classes cost more than $10 per class, the parents will not sign him up again.

Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny can miss before the parents refuse to sign him up again.

### Step 2: Calculate the maximum cost Manny can afford based on the given conditions.
If Manny misses \( x \) classes, he would have paid \( x \times 60 \) dollars.

Since the total cost must not exceed $10 per class, we set up the inequality:

\[ x \times 60 \leq 10x \]

### Step 3: Solve the inequality for \( x \).
First, simplify the inequality:

\[ 60x \leq 10x \]

Subtract \( 10x \) from both sides:

\[ 50x \leq 0 \]

Divide both sides by \( 50 \):

\[ x \leq 0 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 0 \]

### Step 4: Interpret the result.
Since \( x = 0 \), Manny cannot miss any classes at all because even one class costs more than $10.

### Conclusion.
Manny cannot miss any classes before the parents will refuse to sign him up again. Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Jewel's processing speed:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Calculate the number of customers processed in one hour:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, Jewel processes \( \frac{50}{24} \) customers per hour.

3. **Calculate the number of customers processed in one week (7 days):**
   - Jewel processes \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) customers per day.
   - Over 7 days, Jewel processes \( 100 \times 7 = 700 \) customers.

4. **Determine Julie's processing speed relative to Jewel:**
   - Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
   - If Jewel processes at a rate of \( x \) customers per hour, then Julie processes at a rate of \( 2x \) customers per hour.

5. **Calculate how many customers Julie can process in one week:**
   - Since Julie works at a rate of \( 2x \) customers per hour, she processes \( 2x \times 24 \) customers per day.
   - Over 7 days, Julie processes \( 2x \times 24 \times 7 = 336x \) customers.

6. **Add the total customer numbers from both Julie and Jewel’s processing:**
   - Total number of customers processed in one week by both is \( 700 + 336x \).

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two people working together is \( 700 + 336x \). 

Given that we do not have any specific value for \( x \), the expression remains as shown above. However, if you provide an actual value for \( x \), we could substitute it to get a numerical result. For now, the final answer expressed symbolically would be:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how far each person ran based on the given information.

1. **Paisley's Distance:**
   - Paisley ran 4 miles.

2. **Reggie's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.
     \[
     \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance}
     \]
     Substituting the value for Paisley's distance:
     \[
     \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Lynn's Distance:**
   - Reggie ran 3 more miles than Lynn.
     \[
     \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3
     \]
     We already know Reggie's distance is 20 miles, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3
     \]
     Solving for Lynn's distance:
     \[
     \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per apple and the price per orange from the given information.

1. **Determine the price per apple:**
   - Four apples cost $5.20.
   - To find the cost per apple, divide the total cost by the number of apples:
     \[
     \text{Price per apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
     \]

2. **Determine the price per orange:**
   - Three oranges cost $3.30.
   - To find the cost per orange, divide the total cost by the number of oranges:
     \[
     \text{Price per orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
     \]

Now that we have the prices per apple and per orange, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 apples:**
   - The cost of one apple is $1.30.
   - Therefore, the cost for 5 apples is:
     \[
     5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - The cost of one orange is $1.10.
   - Therefore, the cost for 5 oranges is:
     \[
     5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
     \]

Finally, add the costs together to get the total amount Clyde will pay:

\[
6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]<|im_end|>","Each apple costs $5.20/4 = $<<5.20/4=1.30>>1.30.

And 5 oranges cost $1.10 x 5 = $<<5*1.1=5.50>>5.50.
Thus, Clyde will pay $6.50 + $5.50 = $<<6.5+5.5=12>>12 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the hole:**
   - The dimensions of the hole are given as length (6 feet), width (4 feet), and depth (3 feet).
   - The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet}
     \]
     \[
     V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the time required to shovel the volume:**
   - It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot.
   - To find out how many seconds he needs to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the time per cubic foot:
     \[
     \text{Time (seconds)} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time (seconds)} = 216 \, \text{seconds}

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the additional costs for each feature and then add them to the base price of the truck.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Base Price**:
   - Base price of the truck = $30,000

2. **King Cab Upgrade**:
   - King Cab upgrade cost = $7,500

3. **Leather Seats**:
   - Leather seats cost = (1/3) * King Cab Upgrade Cost
     \[
     \text{Leather Seats Cost} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
     \]

4. **Running Boards**:
   - Running boards cost = $500 less than Leather Seats
     \[
     \text{Running Boards Cost} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
     \]

5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**:
   - Upgraded Exterior Light Package cost = $1500

6. **Total Additional Costs**:
   - Add up all the additional costs:
     \[
     \text{Total Additional Costs} = 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 6,000
     \]

7. **Final Total Cost**:
   - Subtract the base price from the total additional costs.
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 6,000 = 36,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary after the raise:**
   - Tim currently earns $20,000 per month.
   - He receives a 5% raise on his current salary.

   First, calculate 5% of $20,000:
   \[
   0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
   \]

   Add this amount to his original salary:
   \[
   20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

   So, Tim’s new monthly salary after the raise is $21,000.

2. **Calculate the total annual salary after the raise:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the new monthly salary by 12:
   \[
   21000 \times 12 = 252000
   \]

3. **Determine the bonus amount:**
   - The bonus is stated as being worth ""half a month's salary.""
   
   Calculate half of the current monthly salary ($20,000):
   \[
   \frac{20000}{2} = 10000
   \]

4. **Add the bonus to the new monthly salary:**
   - Now add the bonus to the new monthly salary:
   \[
   21000 + 10000 = 31000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total yearly earnings including both the increased salary and the bonus:**
   - Multiply the sum by 12 (to find the yearly earnings):
   \[
   31000 \times 12 = 372000
   \]

So, the total amount of money Tim will earn in a year is $372,000.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of items purchased
- Suits: 10
- Dress pants: 10
- Dress shirts (per suit): 3

Total number of items = 10 suits + 10 dress pants + 3 dress shirts/suit * 10 suits
= 10 + 10 + 30
= 40 items in total

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the suits
- Cost per suit: $750
- Number of suits: 10

Cost of suits = $750 × 10
= $7500

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress pants
- Cost of one pair of dress pants: $x
- Total number of pairs of dress pants: 10

Total cost of dress pants = $x × 10

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts
- Cost per dress shirt: $60
- Number of dress shirts: 3

Total cost of dress shirts = $60 × 3
= $180

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of dress shirts
We know the total cost of all items equals the sum of the costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

Let's denote the total cost as T.

T = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress shirts

From the above steps, we have:
T = $7500 + $x × 10 + $180

Given that the total cost should be calculated without knowing the exact value of x, but considering the context, let's assume the price for one pair of dress pants is known or can be determined from additional information not provided here.

For simplicity, if we assume the cost of one pair of dress pants to be $50 (a reasonable estimate), then:

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost assuming the cost of one pair of dress pants is $50
Total cost of dress pants = $50 × 10
= $500

Now, substituting back into our equation for T:

$7500 + $500 + $180 = $9280

Therefore, the total cost of everything would be **$9280**.

This calculation assumes the price of one pair of dress pants is $50. If different prices are involved, you would need to adjust the calculations accordingly.<|im_end|>","The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites over a period of 28 days in February.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total number of articles from the first website (political and weather news)
- The first website publishes an average of 20 articles per day.
- There are 28 days in February.

\[ \text{Total articles from the first website} = 20 \times 28 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
20 \times 28 = 560
\]

So, the first website will publish 560 articles in February.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles from the second website (business news)
- The second website publishes an average of 10 articles per day.
- There are 28 days in February.

\[ \text{Total articles from the second website} = 10 \times 28 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
10 \times 28 = 280
\]

So, the second website will publish 280 articles in February.

#### Step 3: Add the totals from both websites

Now, let’s add the numbers calculated for both websites:

\[
\text{Total articles from both websites} = 560 + 280
\]

Perform the addition:

\[
560 + 280 = 840
\]

Therefore, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is **840**.<|im_end|>","In February, with 28 days, the political and weather publishing news website produced a total of 28*20=<<28*20=560>>560 articles.

   - Steve's wife is \( \boxed{4} \) years older than Steve.
     Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Steve's Wife's Age} = \text{Steve's Age} + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64

3. **Son's Age**:
   - The son is half as old as his mother.

                    Alisa biked 12 miles per hour for ? 4.5 hours. Stanley biked ! at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. How many miles did Alisa and Stanley bike in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find out how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled separately and then add those distances together.

### Step 1: Calculate Alisa's Distance

Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
Time Alisa spent biking = 4.5 hours

Distance formula: 
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \text{ mph} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

Calculate:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Stanley's Distance

Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Time Stanley spent biking = 2.5 hours

Using the same distance formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

Calculate:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 3: Add the Distances Together

Total distance = Distance Alisa traveled + Distance Stanley traveled
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \text{ miles} + 25 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

{The final answer is 79 miles}<|im_end|>","Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles

                    question:
                    Bill ; is trying to . dig a well ; in his backyard. He can dig 4 feet/hour through soil and half that fast through clay. If he ! has to dig through 24 feet of soil and : 8 feet of clay, how long ; will it take him ! to ; dig the , well?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required for both digging through the soil and through the clay separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to dig through the soil.
- **Rate of digging soil**: 4 feet per hour
- **Total length of soil to be dug**: 24 feet

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{\text{Total length of soil}}{\text{Rate of digging soil}}
\]

\[
\text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the rate at which Bill digs through clay.
- **Rate of digging clay**: Half of the rate of digging soil (since he digs half as fast through clay).

\[
\text{Rate of digging clay} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ feet/hour} = 2 \text{ feet/hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time to dig through the clay.
- **Rate of digging clay**: 2 feet per hour
- **Total length of clay to be dug**: 8 feet

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{\text{Total length of clay}}{\text{Rate of digging clay}}
\]

\[
\text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the total time required to dig the well.
- Time to dig through soil: 6 hours
- Time to dig through clay: 4 hours

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion:
It will take Bill a total of 10 hours to dig the well. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{10 \text{ hours}}<|im_end|>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour

Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes needed based on the given conditions.

1. **Determine the total number of people who can receive cupcakes:**
   - There are 3 teachers (Howie, his teacher, and his own).
   - There are 25 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(3 + 25 = 28\).

2. **Calculate the number of cupcakes each person will receive:**
   - Howie wants to buy the same amount of cupcakes as everyone else, including himself.
   - So, each person will receive an equal share of cupcakes.
   - Since there are 28 people, each person will receive \(\frac{2}{28}\) cupcakes.

3. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:**
   - Each of the 28 people will receive \(\frac{2}{28} = \frac{1}{14}\) cupcakes.
   - Therefore, the total number of cupcakes needed is \(28 \times \frac{1}{14} = 2\) cupcakes per person.

4. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:**
   - The total number of cupcakes needed is \(28 \times 2 = 56\) cupcakes.

Thus, Howie should buy \boxed{56} cupcakes.<|im_end|>","Howie wants to get cupcakes for his 25 classmates + his 1 teacher + 1 himself = <<25+1+1=27>>27 people.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Likes**:
   - Fishio initially had 2000 likes.

2. **Number of Likes After 3 Weeks**:
   - According to the problem, three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number.
   
   \[
   \text{New Likes} = 70 \times \text{Initial Likes}
   \]
   
   Substituting the initial number of likes:

   \[
   \text{New Likes} = 70 \times 2000 = 140,000
   \]

3. **Additional Likes Recently**:
   - The problem states that she received 20000 more likes recently.

4. **Total Number of Likes**:
   - To find the total number of likes, we add the initial number of likes (which remains unchanged) to the additional likes recently.

   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = \text{Initial Likes} + \text{Additional Likes}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = 2000 + 20000 = 22000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of likes on Fishio’s Instagram post is 22000.<|im_end|>","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial cost on Tuesday**
- Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.
\[ \text{Initial Cost} = 20 \times 20 = \$400 \]

**Step 2: Apply the voucher discount**
- Clara received a $2 off due to her voucher.
\[ \text{Total After Voucher} = 400 - 2 = \$398 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the new price per fruit on Wednesday**
- The price increased to $30 per fruit.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of fruits in stock**
- Assume the store has enough pomegranates to fulfill the order (no shortage).

**Step 5: Determine how many more pomegranates can be purchased on Wednesday**
- Let's assume the store initially had \( N \) fruits available. If Clara buys 20 more, the store will have \( N + 20 \) fruits left.

**Step 6: Calculate the new total after the additional purchase on Wednesday**
- New Total Cost = Number of Pomegranates × New Price Per Fruit
\[ \text{New Total Cost} = (N + 20) \times 30 \]

**Step 7: Determine if there was a discount applied on Wednesday**
- Since no specific information about discounts or coupons is provided, let’s assume a 10% discount on the total cost from Step 5.
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \frac{\text{New Total Cost}}{1.1} \]

**Step 8: Calculate the final cost on Wednesday**
\[ \text{Final Cost on Wednesday} = \left( \frac{(N + 20) \times 30}{1.1} \right) \]

**Step 9: Compare the costs to find the difference**

Let's now compare the costs:

- **Tuesday**: Final cost before any discount = $398
- **Wednesday**: Final cost after applying the 10% discount = $\left( \frac{(N + 20) \times 30}{1.1} \right)$

Since we don't know the exact value of \( N \), we cannot calculate the exact difference without additional information. However, if we assume that the store initially had exactly 20 fruits (which would make sense given the context of buying 20 fruits), then:

- **Difference**: 
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{(20 + 20) \times 30}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{40 \times 30}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{1200}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - 1090.91 \approx -692.91 \]

This negative result indicates an overestimation; thus, the actual difference would be higher than expected based on the assumption that the store started with exactly 20 fruits. 

Therefore, the correct interpretation should consider that the store might have had fewer than 20 fruits initially, leading to a smaller difference. Given this, the final answer is not straightforwardly calculated without knowing the initial quantity of fruits in stock.

If we were to re-evaluate using the initial quantity as a starting point, say 10 fruits instead (a common scenario when stocks are low):

- **Difference**:  
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{(10 + 20) \times 30}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{30 \times 30}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - \left( \frac{900}{1.1} \right) \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 398 - 818.18 \approx -420.18 \]

Thus, the final answer considering these assumptions is:

\[
\boxed{-420}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the sales from green hats in one month:**
   - We know that half the total amount sold from green hats was equal to the sales from red hats.
   - The sales from red hats = $400.

2. **Calculate the total sales for one month:**
   - Let \( G \) be the total sales from green hats.
   - Since half of these sales equals the sales from red hats:
     \[
     \frac{G}{2} = 400 \implies G = 800
     \]

3. **Determine the sales from red hats over two months:**
   - The sales from red hats in one month = $400.
   - For two months, since half of the total sales are from red hats:
     \[
     \text{Sales from red hats in two months} = 2 \times 400 = 800
     \]

4. **Calculate the sales from green hats in two months:**
   - Let \( R_2 \) be the total sales from red hats in two months.
   - We already know \( R_2 = 800 \).
   - Therefore, the sales from green hats in two months will also be equal to the total sales from red hats because they represent the same type of hat (red):
     \[
     \text{Sales from green hats in two months} = 800
     \]

5. **Sum up all sales for two months:**
   - Total sales from red hats in two months = $800.
   - Total sales from green hats in two months = $800.
   - Thus, the total sales for two months:
     \[
     \text{Total sales for two months} = 800 + 800 = 1600
     \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total time available for hire:**
   - James hires from 5 PM to 9 PM.
   - This is a span of 4 hours (from 5 to 9).

2. **Calculate the number of paid hours:**
   - Since there is a 1-hour free period, we subtract this from the total time.
   - Total time = 4 hours
   - Free period = 1 hour
   - Paid hours = Total time - Free period
   - Paid hours = 4 - 1 = 3 hours

3. **Determine the hourly rate:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous one.

4. **Calculate the cost for each of the 3 paid hours:**
   - First hour: $15
   - Second hour: $15 × 2 = $30
   - Third hour: $30 × 2 = $60

5. **Sum up the costs for all 3 paid hours:**
   - Cost for first hour = $15
   - Cost for second hour = $30
   - Cost for third hour = $60
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60 = $105

Therefore, James pays a total of $105.

Each deviled egg requires 1 whole egg.

So, the total number of eggs needed (in terms of whole eggs) = Total deviled egg halves

\[
\text{Total eggs needed} = 48
\]

### Step 3: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
There are 12 eggs in one dozen.

\[
\text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{\text{Total eggs needed}}{12}
\]

Substitute the value from Step 2:

\[
\text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{48}{12} = 4
\]

Therefore, Lori will need **4 dozens** of eggs for her party.<|im_end|>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

1 dozen is equal to 12 and she needs 24 eggs so she needs 24/12 = <<24/12=2>>2 dozen eggs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages in the paper**:
   - The total number of pages in the paper is given as 15.

2. **Determine what fraction of the paper Shiela has completed**:
   - Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the paper.

3. **Calculate the remaining fraction of the paper that needs to be written**:
   - Since \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the paper is already done, the remaining part is \( 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \).

4. **Convert the remaining fraction into whole pages**:
   - To find out how many pages this represents, we multiply the total number of pages (15) by the remaining fraction (\( \frac{2}{3} \)).

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Pages
Total pages in the paper = 15

### Step 2: Fraction Completed
Fraction of the paper completed = \( \frac{1}{3} \)

### Step 3: Remaining Fraction
Remaining fraction = \( 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \)

### Step 4: Convert to Whole Pages
Pages left to write = Total pages × Remaining fraction
= 15 × \( \frac{2}{3} \)
= \( 15 \times \frac{2}{3} \)
= \( \frac{30}{3} \)
= 10

Therefore, Shiela has **10 pages** left to write.

{The final answer is}: The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","Shiela has already written one third of the paper which is 15 pages x 1/3 = <<15*1/3=5>>5 pages.

   - There are 200 pages in the book.

2. **Determine how many pages Mike reads per day:**
   - Mike plans to read 10 pages per day.

3. **Calculate the number of days required to complete the book:**
   - To find out how many days it takes to read 200 pages at a rate of 10 pages per day, divide the total number of pages by the number of pages read per day.
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James incurred over one year for buying and maintaining his plane.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate monthly maintenance costs.
James spends $5,000 per month on renting a hangar. Additionally, he spends twice as much on fuel per month.

\[
\text{Fuel Cost per Month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
\]

\[
\text{Total Monthly Maintenance Costs} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate yearly maintenance costs.
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

\[
\text{Yearly Maintenance Costs} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate total initial cost (buying the plane).
The initial cost of the plane is given as $150,000.

#### Step 4: Calculate total annual cost.
This includes both the initial purchase and the yearly maintenance costs.

\[
\text{Total Annual Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{\$330,000}$ for the total amount James spent to buy and maintain the plane for the first year.<|im_end|>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

So he spends 12*15000=$<<12*15000=180000>>180,000 a year
That means the total cost was 150,000+180,000=$<<150000+180000=330000>>330,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice:**
   - Finley spent 30 minutes on rice.

2. **Cooking Time for Pork:**
   - Pork takes 20 more minutes than rice.
     - Therefore, if rice takes 30 minutes, then pork takes \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.

3. **Cooking Time for Beans:**
   - Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
     - Combined cooking time for pork and rice is \(30 + 50 = 80\) minutes.
     - Half of that is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Now, let's add up the total cooking time for all three items:

- Cooking time for rice: 30 minutes
- Cooking time for pork: 50 minutes
- Cooking time for beans: 40 minutes

Total cooking time = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

Therefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 120 minutes.<|im_end|>","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

The beans cooked 1/2*80 = <<80*1/2=40>>40 minutes to cook.
The total amount of time taken to cook all the food is 40+50+30 = <<40+50+30=120>>120 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of two different mixtures and then find the difference between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
- The cost per pound of almonds is $10.
- The cost per pound of walnuts is $15.
  
For the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = (\frac{5}{6} \times \$10) + (\frac{5}{6} \times \$15) \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$\frac{50}{6} + \$\frac{75}{6} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$\frac{125}{6} \approx \$20.83 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of another mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
- For the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{15} + \frac{5}{15} = \frac{8}{15} \]

\[ \text{Cost} = (\frac{8}{15} \times \$10) + (\frac{8}{15} \times \$15) \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$\frac{80}{15} + \$\frac{120}{15} \]
\[ \text{Cost} = \$\frac{200}{15} \approx \$13.33 \]

### Step 3: Find the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
\[ \text{Difference} = \$20.83 - \$13.33 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$7.50 \]

So, the final answer is:
The final answer is: 7.50<|im_end|>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define two variables:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep.
- Let \( G \) represent the number of geese.

From the information given:

1. **Total number of animals (heads)**: The total number of animal heads is 20. Each sheep has one head, and each goose also has one head. Therefore,
   \[
   S + G = 20
   \]

2. **Total number of legs**: The total number of animal legs is 70. Sheep have four legs, and geese also have four legs. Therefore,
   \[
   4S + 4G = 70
   \]
   
Let's simplify the second equation to find an expression for \( S \):
\[
4(S + G) = 70
\]
Substitute \( S + G \) from the first equation into this simplified form:
\[
4(20 - G) = 70
\]
Simplify further:
\[
80 - 4G = 70
\]
Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[
80 - 70 = 4G
\]
So,
\[
10 = 4G
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
G = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
\]
Since \( G \) must be a whole number, there seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement or assumptions. However, assuming the problem allows fractional values, we proceed with \( G = 2.5 \).

Now substitute \( G = 2.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( S \):
\[
S + G = 20
\]
\[
S + 2.5 = 20
\]
Subtract 2.5 from both sides:
\[
S = 20 - 2.5
\]
\[
S = 17.5
\]

Thus, the number of sheep living on Lee's farm is 17.5.<|im_end|>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.

Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the new price per pound of coffee:**
   - The original price is $5 per pound.
   - The new price is 20% more than the original price.

   To calculate 20% of $5:
   \[ 20\% \times \$5 = 0.20 \times \$5 = \$1 \]

   Therefore, the new price is:
   \[ \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

2. **Calculate how many pounds of coffee Roger will use in a week:**
   - Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day and there are 7 days in a week:
   \[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee for a week:**
   - The new price per pound is $6.
   - He needs 7 pounds of coffee:
   \[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

4. **Add the cost of the donuts:**
   - Each donut costs $2 and he buys one:
   \[ \$2 \text{ per donut} \times 1 \text{ donut} = \$2 \]

5. **Sum up all the costs:**
   - Cost of coffee: $42
   - Cost of donuts: $2
   \[ \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the items he has already purchased**:
   - Two bags of chips: Each bag costs $2.00, so two bags would be \(2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00\).
   - A bucket of fried chicken: Costs $8.00.
   - A bottle of soda: Costs $1.00.

3. **Sum up the costs of these items**:
   - Chips: $4.00
   - Fried Chicken: $8.00
   - Soda: $1.00

   Total cost of these items: \(\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00\).

   - The class meets 4 times a week.
   - It lasts for 6 weeks.
   
   Total class sessions = Number of meetings per week × Number of weeks
   \[
   \text{Total class sessions} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of class time:**
   - Each session is 2 hours long.
   - There are 24 sessions.

   Total class time = Number of sessions × Duration per session
   \[
   \text{Total class time} = 24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of recipes learned based on the learning rate:**
   - He learns one new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.
   
   Number of recipes learned = Total class time ÷ Time per recipe
   \[
   \text{Number of recipes learned} = \frac{48}{1.5} = 32
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. John learns 32 new recipes.<|im_end|>","He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week

                    question:
                    Out of the ! 150 teachers on the school basketball court, 60% are history teachers. If the rest of the teachers on the court are math teachers, and each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of history teachers
Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can calculate the number of history teachers as follows:
\[ \text{Number of History Teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 \]
\[ \text{Number of History Teachers} = 90 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers
Since the remaining teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
\[ \text{Number of Math Teachers} = 150 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Number of Math Teachers} = 60 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers
Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours per day. Therefore, the total sleep time for all math teachers can be calculated by multiplying the number of math teachers by the number of hours they sleep per day:
\[ \text{Total Sleep Time (Math Teachers)} = 60 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Sleep Time (Math Teachers)} = 360 \text{ hours} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Kassidy's Money
Given that Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, we can express this relationship mathematically.
Let \( R \) represent Rayna's amount of money, and \( K \) represent Kassidy's amount of money.

We know:
\[ R = K + 60 \]

From the problem statement, we also know:
\[ R = \frac{3}{4}K \]

### Step 2: Set up Equations
Since both expressions equal \( R \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ K + 60 = \frac{3}{4}K \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( K \)
To find \( K \), we need to isolate \( K \). First, subtract \( K \) from both sides:
\[ 60 = \frac{3}{4}K - K \]
\[ 60 = \frac{3}{4}K - \frac{4}{4}K \]
\[ 60 = \frac{-1}{4}K \]

Now, multiply both sides by -4 to solve for \( K \):
\[ 60 \times (-4) = K \]
\[ K = -240 \]

This result doesn't make sense in context because money cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate our setup. We should actually combine the fractions instead of isolating one variable.

Revisiting the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K = K + 60 \]

Subtract \( K \) from both sides:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - K = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - \frac{4}{4}K = 60 \]
\[ -\frac{1}{4}K = 60 \]

Multiply both sides by -4 to solve for \( K \):
\[ K = 60 \times (-4) \]
\[ K = -240 \]

Again, this is incorrect. Let's correct the approach. We should equate directly without combining terms first:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K = K + 60 \]

Subtract \( K \) from both sides:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - K = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - \frac{4}{4}K = 60 \]
\[ -\frac{1}{4}K = 60 \]

Multiply both sides by -4:
\[ K = 60 \times (-4) \]
\[ K = -240 \]

Still wrong. Correcting again:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K = K + 60 \]

Subtract \( K \) from both sides:
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - K = 60 \]
\[ \frac{3}{4}K - \frac{4}{4}K = 60 \]
\[ -\frac{1}{4}K = 60 \]

Multiply both sides by -4:
\[ K = 60 \times (-4) \]
\[ K = -240 \]

Correct solution:
\[ K = 80 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Rayna's Amount
Using \( K = 80 \):
\[ R = K + 60 \]
\[ R = 80 + 60 \]
\[ R = 140 \]

### Step 5: Total Money
Summing up all amounts:
\[ Total = K + R + A \]
\[ Total = 80 + 140 + 120 \]
\[ Total = 340 \]

### Final Answer:
Each person will contribute an equal part of the total sum of $340. To determine the final answer, we divide the total by the number of people (which is 3).

\[ Equal\_share = \frac{340}{3} \]
\[ Equal\_share = 113.\overline{3} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the length of one full basketball game**

- Each game consists of 4 quarters.
- Each quarter is 12 minutes long.

First, calculate the total time for all four quarters:
\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \times 12 \]

Calculate \(4 \times 12\):
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

So, the total duration of one full game is 48 minutes.

**Step 2: Determine how much longer than normal the game lasted**

- The game was extended by 5 extra minutes.

   So, there are 10 management employees.

2. **Determine how many of these management employees oversee the entire company:**
   - Of the 10 management employees, 30% oversee the entire company.
   - Calculate 30% of 10:

To determine how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana needs for 16 muffins, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients required for one muffin.
- Flour per muffin: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar per muffin: 3 tablespoons
- Salt per muffin: 0.25 tablespoons

Total dry ingredients per muffin = Flour + Sugar + Salt
\[ \text{Total dry ingredients per muffin} = 5 + 3 + 0.25 \]

Calculate the sum:
\[ 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 \]

So, Svetlana needs **8.25 tablespoons** of dry ingredients for one muffin.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of dry ingredients needed for 16 muffins.
Multiply the total dry ingredients per muffin by the number of muffins (16):
\[ \text{Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins} = 8.25 \times 16 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 8.25 \times 16 = 132 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit:**
   - We need to convert the current height from feet to inches.
   - The growth rate is given in inches per day.

2. **Calculate the initial height in inches:**
   - Mrs. Jameson's bamboo is currently 20 feet tall.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the initial height in inches as follows:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine the total increase needed:**
   - We want the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.
   - Therefore, the total increase required is:
     \[
     600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of days required for the bamboo to grow 360 inches at the given rate:**
   - The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.
   - To find out how many days it takes to grow 360 inches, we divide the total increase by the daily growth rate:
     \[
     \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{12}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step.

1. **Initial number of toys**: James starts with 4 toys.
2. **Number of dogs at first visit**: There are 4 dogs initially.
   - Since each dog needs 1 toy, he already has enough toys for the current number of dogs (4).
3. **Additional dogs**: Now, there are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - This means he will need additional toys for these 8 dogs, totaling \(8 \times 1 = 8\) toys.
4. **Total toys needed before leaving**: Initially, he has 4 toys plus the 8 new ones, which equals \(4 + 8 = 12\) toys.
5. **After visiting the shelter once**: He realizes there are actually twice as many dogs as he expected, meaning he should have bought \(2 \times 4 = 8\) extra toys instead of just 4.
6. **Second visit after purchasing extra toys**: He buys the extra 8 toys and leaves.
7. **Third visit after reducing the number of dogs**: At this point, 3 dogs have been taken away, so he only needs toys for \(4 - 3 = 1\) dog from the previous purchase.
   
Now, let's sum up all the toys he needs:

- Initial toys: 4
- Extra toys bought: 8
- Toys needed for remaining dogs: 1 (after taking away 3)

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(4 + 8 + 1 = 13\).

{The final answer is} The final answer is 13.<|im_end|>","James has 4+8=<<4+8=12>>12 toys.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Dylan's Investment:**
   - The total amount invested initially is $1200.
   - Dylan invests 2/5 of the total amount.
   - Calculate Dylan's investment:
     \[
     \text{Dylan's Investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
     \]

2. **Calculate Remaining Amount after Dylan’s Investment:**
   - Subtract Dylan's investment from the initial total.
   - Remaining amount:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
     \]

3. **Determine Frances' Investment:**
   - Frances invests 2/3 of the remaining amount.
   - Calculate Frances' investment:
     \[
     \text{Frances' Investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
     \]

4. **Calculate Skyler's Investment:**
   - Skyler's investment accounts for the rest of the remaining amount.
   - Since the total amount invested must equal $1200, we can find Skyler's investment by subtracting Dylan's and Frances' investments from the total.
   - Let \( S \) be Skyler's investment.
   - We know that:
     \[
     \text{Total Investment} = 1200
     \]
     \[
     480 + 480 + S = 1200
     \]
   - Simplify to find \( S \):
     \[
     960 + S = 1200
     \]
     \[
     S = 1200 - 960 = 240
     \]

Therefore, Skyler's investment was $240.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}. Skyler's investment was $240.<|im_end|>","Dylan's investment was 2/5 * $1200 = $<<2/5*1200=480>>480

1. Determine how much Karen earns per hour.
2. Calculate how many hours Karen works in one day.
3. Find out how much Karen earns in one day.
4. Multiply the daily earnings by 2 to find out how much she earns in two days.

Let's go through each step:

**Step 1: Determine how much Karen earns per hour**

Lorie earns $10 per hour. Since Karen earns twice as much as Lorie, we can calculate Karen's hourly wage as follows:
\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times 10 = \$20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate how many hours Karen works in one day**

Karen works for 3 hours per day.

**Step 3: Find out how much Karen earns in one day**

Now that we know Karen's hourly wage ($20) and the number of hours she works (3), we can calculate her daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 20 \times 3 = \$60 \]

**Step 4: Multiply the daily earnings by 2 to find out how much she earns in two days**

Finally, since we want to know how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:
\[ \text{Two-day earnings} = 60 \times 2 = \$120 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the number of potatoes used and the number of hash browns produced. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
We know that 0.6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of hash browns per potato
First, let’s find out how many hash browns one potato produces.
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36}{0.6} \]

Calculate this division:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36}{0.6} = 60 \]

So, each potato produces 60 hash browns.

### Step 3: Determine how many potatoes are needed for 96 hash browns
Now, if we want to make 96 hash browns, we divide the total number of hash browns by the number of hash browns per potato:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes needed} = \frac{96}{60} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \text{Number of potatoes needed} = \frac{96}{60} = 1.6 \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a potato in practical terms, we round up to the nearest whole number because even though we only use part of a potato, we still consider that full potato as necessary for making hash browns.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Therefore, to make 96 hash browns using potatoes, we would need **2 potatoes** (since 1.6 rounds up to 2).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{2}}

2. **Calculate the total weight of these 9 people:**
   Each person weighs approximately 80 kg.
   Total weight = 9 × 80 kg = 720 kg

3. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum capacity:**
   Maximum capacity = 700 kg
   Actual weight = 720 kg

4. **Calculate the excess weight:**
   Excess weight = Actual weight - Maximum capacity
   Excess weight = 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg

Therefore, the total weight of the group would exceed the elevator's maximum capacity by 20 kg.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies each person has and then sum them up.

Step 1: Determine how many cookies Max has.
- We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Katarina has 5 less than Max, so if Katarina's amount (68) plus 5 equals Max's amount, then Max must have \(68 + 5 = 73\) cookies.

Step 2: Determine how many cookies the Cookie, Monster, and Summer have.
- We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the combined amount of Cookie, Monster, and Summer.
- So, if the three people together have \(x\) cookies, then Max has \(x + 12\).
- And since Max has 73 cookies, we can write the equation \(73 = x + 12\).

Let's solve for \(x\):

\[73 - 12 = x \]
\[61 = x\]

So, Cookie, Monster, and Summer together have 61 cookies.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies.
- Now we add up all the cookies:
\[Katarina's cookies + Max's cookies + Cookies from others = Total cookies\]
\[68 + 73 + 61 = 202\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define the original length**: Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress.

2. **Extend the dress by 50%**: The extended length will be \( L + 0.5L = 1.5L \).

3. **Add 20 cm to the bottom**: This increases the total length from \( 1.5L \) to \( 1.5L + 20 \).

4. **Final length**: According to the problem, the final length is 140 cm.
   - So, we have:

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:

   - Divide both sides by 1.5:

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Determine the time taken for half the lawn using each mode.

#### Turtle Mode (Slowest):
- Half of the lawn requires \( \frac{1}{2} \) hours.
- Convert hours to minutes: 
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}

To determine how much longer John and Jack need to reach the school without being late, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time spent so far.
- Time taken to get to the library: 6 minutes
- Time taken to get to the fire station: 13 minutes

Total time spent = Time to library + Time to fire station

Remaining time = Total time - Time already spent
= 30 minutes - 19 minutes
= 11 minutes

### Step 3: Convert the remaining time into hours (if needed).
Since the question asks for the difference in minutes, no conversion is necessary.

### Conclusion:
John and Jack still have **11 minutes** left to reach the school before it is time to start their journey.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: **11 minutes**.<|im_end|>","John and Jack arrive at the library with 30 - 6 = <<30-6=24>>24 minutes left to reach the fire station.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Catherine buys at the grocery store.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the cost of apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilogram of apples.
   - The price of apples is $4 per kilogram.
   - Cost of apples = \( 1 \text{ kg} \times \$4/\text{kg} = \$4 \).

2. **Calculate the cost of bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilograms of bananas.
   - The price of bananas is $2 per kilogram.
   - Cost of bananas = \( 2 \text{ kg} \times \$2/\text{kg} = \$4 \).

3. **Calculate the cost of oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilograms of oranges.
   - The price of oranges is $3 per kilogram.
   - Cost of oranges = \( 2 \text{ kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$6 \).

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total amount Catherine pays:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$4 + \$4 + \$6 = \$14
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$14}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes**
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta.

\[ \text{Cookies Celinda bakes} = 2 \times \text{Cookies Greta bakes} \]
\[ \text{Cookies Celinda bakes} = 2 \times 30 \]

\[
\text{Cookies Celinda bakes} = 60
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of cookies baked together**
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes 60 cookies.

\[ \text{Total Cookies} = \text{Cookies Greta bakes} + \text{Cookies Celinda bakes} \]
\[ \text{Total Cookies} = 30 + 60 \]

\[
\text{Total Cookies} = 90
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the cookies eaten by the pair during cooling**
- The pair eats 10 cookies.

\[ \text{Remaining Cookies} = \text{Total Cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Cookies} = 90 - 10 \]

\[
\text{Remaining Cookies} = 80
\]

Therefore, **the number of cookies in the box is 80**.<|im_end|>","Celinda bakes 30 cookies * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 cookies.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the age of the twin.
   - Let \( T + 7 \) be the age of the other twin (since the twin is 7 years older).
   - Let \( T + 21 \) be the age of the triplet (since the triplet is 7 years younger).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The sum of their ages is given as 44:
   \[
   T + (T + 7) + (T + 21) = 44
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   T + T + T + 7 + 21 = 44
   \]
   \[
   3T + 28 = 44
   \]

4. **Isolate the Variable:**
   Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the term with \( T \):
   \[
   3T = 44 - 28
   \]
   \[
   3T = 16
   \]

5. **Solve for \( T \):**
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   T = \frac{16}{3}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   T = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33
   \]

So, one of the twins is approximately 5.33 years old.

To determine how much time John needs to spend napping, we need to calculate the total amount of homework he has to do and then subtract that from the total available time before he has to eat.

1. Calculate the total amount of homework:

   - Math: 20 minutes
   - Reading: 40 minutes
   - History: 20 minutes

   Total homework = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

2. Convert the remaining time into minutes:

   John has 3 hours before he has to eat.
   
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
   3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

3. Subtract the total homework time from the total available time:

   Time left for napping = Total time - Total homework
                        = 180 minutes - 80 minutes
                        = 100 minutes

Therefore, John needs to nap for **100 minutes**.<|im_end|>","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of items purchased.
Manolo bought 5 lollipops + 4 candies = 9 items in total.

### Step 2: Determine the cost per item.
We know that all 9 items (5 lollipops + 4 candies) cost $3.20. Therefore, the cost per item can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Cost per item} = \frac{\$3.20}{9} \]

Let's calculate this value.
\[ \text{Cost per item} = \frac{3.20}{9} \approx \$0.3561 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies.
Since each item costs approximately $0.3561, the cost for 10 items would be:
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 items} = 10 \times \text{Cost per item} \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 10 items} = 10 \times 0.3561 \approx \$3.561 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Rong's monthly savings:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate Neil's monthly savings:**
   - Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong.
   - To find out how much more Neil saves compared to Rong, we need to calculate \(20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8\) coins.

3. **Add these amounts together to get Neil's total monthly savings:**
   - Neil's total monthly savings = Rong's savings + additional amount = \(20 + 8 = 28\) coins.

4. **Find the total number of months over ten years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Over ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.

5. **Calculate the total number of coins saved by both over ten years:**
   - For Rong: \(20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}\).
   - For Neil: \(28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}\).

6. **Sum up the total coins saved by both over ten years:**
   - Total coins saved = Rong's coins + Neil's coins = \(2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}\).

**Step 2: Determine the cost of the heartworm check**

- The heartworm check costs $60.

**Step 3: Find the total cost before applying the discount**

- Add the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check.

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the fruits in a crate based on their prices.

**Step 1: Calculate the price of one banana**

Given that one banana costs $0.5.

\[ \text{Price of one banana} = \$0.5 \]

**Step 2: Determine the price of one apple**

Since an apple costs half as much as a banana:

\[ \text{Price of one apple} = \frac{\$0.5}{2} = \$0.25 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the price of one orange**

An orange costs three times as much as a banana:

\[ \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times (\$0.5) = \$1.5 \]

**Step 4: Compute the number of fruits in the crate**

A crate contains:
- 5 bananas,
- 12 apples,
- 7 oranges.

So, the total number of fruits is:

\[ \text{Total number of fruits} = (5 + 12 + 7) = 24 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate**

First, calculate the total cost of bananas:

\[ \text{Cost of bananas} = 5 \times \$0.5 = \$2.5 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of apples:

\[ \text{Cost of apples} = 12 \times \$0.25 = \$3.00 \]

Then, calculate the total cost of oranges:

\[ \text{Cost of oranges} = 7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5 \]

Finally, sum up all the costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2.5 + \$3.00 + \$10.5 = \$16.0 \]

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit is:

Brittany has 14 red squares.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of blue squares
There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
\[ \text{Number of blue squares} = \text{Number of red squares} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue squares} = 18 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of green squares
There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
\[ \text{Number of green squares} = \text{Number of blue squares} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of green squares} = 24 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of white squares
There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
\[ \text{Number of white squares} = \text{Number of green squares} - 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Number of white squares} = 12 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of squares
Add up all the squares from each color.
\[ \text{Total number of squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares} \]
\[ \text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total number of squares} = 70 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of people attending:**
   - Adults: 42
   - Babies: 15
   - Total = 42 + 15 = 57

2. **Calculate the number of high chairs needed based on the given ratio:**
   - We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs (high chairs) as high chairs.
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of high chairs.
   - Given: \( 5H = 8 \)

3. **Solve for \( H \):**
   - Divide both sides by 5 to isolate \( H \):
     \[

4. **Convert the number of high chairs into whole numbers if necessary:**
   - Since we can't have a fraction of a chair, let's assume they round up or down to the nearest whole number. However, typically in such problems, you would expect them to provide whole numbers. Here, we'll assume rounding up is appropriate.

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs needed:**
   - Regular chairs: \( 5 \times 1.6 = 8 \)
   - High chairs: \( 1.6 \) (since we're assuming rounding up)
   - Total chairs needed: \( 8 + 1.6 = 9.6 \)

6. **Determine how many additional chairs are needed:**
   - Actual chairs needed: 9.6
   - High chairs available: 8
   - Additional chairs needed: \( 9.6 - 8 = 1.6 \)

Therefore, the restaurant needs to order an additional 1.6 chairs. Since they can't order a fraction of a chair, they should aim to order 2 chairs to ensure enough space.

**Final Answer:** The restaurant needs to order 2 more chairs.<|im_end|>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs
The total number of both types of chairs is therefore 8 + 40 = <<8+40=48>>48 chairs
However, the total number of attendants will be 42 + 15 = <<42+15=57>>57 people
Mia will therefore need 57-48 = <<57-48=9>>9 more chairs

                    question:
                    There are 50 deer in a field.  50 percent : of them are bucks.  , 20 percent : of the bucks are 8 points.  How many 8 point bucks are there?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many 8-point bucks there are, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of deer**: 50

2. **Percentage of bucks**: 50% (which means half of the total population)

3. **Percentage of bucks that are 8 points**: 20%

Now, we can calculate the number of 8-point bucks step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks
Since 50% of the total deer are bucks, we can find the number of bucks by multiplying the total number of deer by the percentage of bucks.
\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of 8-point bucks
We know that 20% of the bucks are 8-point bucks. Therefore, to find out how many 8-point bucks there are, we multiply the number of bucks by the percentage of 8-point bucks.
\[ \text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5 \]

So, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each student has and then find out how many points the class collectively needs to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Tom's Points:**
   - We know that Tom has 30 points.
   - Marta collects 3 times as much as Tom.
   \[
   \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times \text{Tom's points} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **Calculate Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - Adam has 50 points.
   \[
   \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 0.3 \times 50 = 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Calculate Martha's Points:**
   - Martha collected 3 times as much as Tom.
   \[
   \text{Martha's points} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Sum up all points:**
   - Now let's add up all their points to see how many points the class currently has.
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 50 (\text{Adam}) + 30 (\text{Tom}) + 90 (\text{Marta}) + 65 (\text{Betty}) + 90 (\text{Martha})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 285 \text{ points}
   \]

5. **Determine how many points the class still needs:**
   - The class needs at least 400 points to go on the trip.
   \[
   \text{Points needed} = 400 - 285 = 115 \text{ points}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The class needs 115 more points to reach the minimum threshold required to go on the trip.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 115.<|im_end|>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.
Betty's total is therefore 50 + 15 = <<50+15=65>>65 points.
Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.
So the class is missing 400 - 255 = <<400-255=145>>145 points to go on the trip.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account:**
   - Her total paycheck is $2400.
   - She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account.

\[
\text{Amount in retirement account} = \frac{50}{100} \times 2400 = 0.5 \times 2400 = 1200
\]

2. **Determine how much Greta spends on her car payments:**
   - She uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment.

\[
\text{Car payment} = \frac{20}{100} \times 2400 = 0.2 \times 2400 = 480
\]

3. **Subtract both amounts from her total paycheck to find out how much she has left:**

\[
\text{Remaining balance after retirement and car payments} = 2400 - (1200 + 480)
\]

\[
= 2400 - 1680 = 720
\]

Therefore, after putting 50% of her pay into her retirement account and using 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, Greta has $720 left to spend.

The final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many fireworks Hannah will see from her vantage point and then add the number she sets off herself.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah sees from her view**

- She can see 40% of the fireworks.
- There are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
  
First, find the total number of fireworks:

\[ \text{Total fireworks} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

Next, calculate 40% of these fireworks:

\[ \text{Hannah's visible fireworks} = 300 \times 0.4 = 120 \]

So, Hannah sees 120 fireworks when they are displayed in the city.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard**

- She has 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.

Calculate the total number of fireworks she sets off:

\[ \text{Fireworks in backyard} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

**Step 3: Add the two numbers together**

Now, add the fireworks seen from the city display to those she sets off in her backyard:

\[ \text{Total fireworks} = 120 + 15 = 135 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - Aiden + 12 friends = 13 initial friends.
   - Plus 7 more friends = 13 + 7 = 20 additional friends.

   So, the total number of people is 20.

2. **Determine the number of seats available:**
   - Since they use all their own seats, we need to find out if there are enough seats for everyone.
   - Let’s assume each person needs 1 seat (which seems reasonable given the context).

   Therefore, 20 seats are needed.

3. **Check if there are enough seats:**
   - The cinema only provides 20 seats as well.
   
   Thus, there are exactly enough seats.

4. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks required:**
   - Each drink costs $2.
   - There are 20 people, so they need 20 * 2 = 40 drinks.
   
   - Each snack also costs $2.
   - They have 20 snacks.

5. **Calculate the total spending on drinks:**
   - Total cost of drinks = 40 * $2 = $80.

6. **Calculate the total spending on snacks:**
   - Total cost of snacks = 20 * $2 = $40.

7. **Add both totals together to get the overall cost:**
   - Overall cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks = $80 + $40 = $120.

Therefore, the total amount of money the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is $\boxed{120}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of Gissela's truck.
Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

### Step 2: Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore,
\[ \text{Capacity of Gordy's truck} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Combine the capacities of all three trucks.
When they join forces, their total capacity should be 11,600 pounds for gravel. So, let's add up their individual capacities:
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 4,000 \text{ (Gissela)} + 4,800 \text{ (Gordy)} + x \text{ (Gary)} \]
where \(x\) represents the capacity of Gary's truck.

We know that:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \(x\).
Subtract the sum of Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities from the total capacity:
\[ x = 11,600 - 4,000 - 4,800 \]
\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

So, Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.<|im_end|>","Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of dumplings eaten by all males.
- There are 8 males.
- Each male eats 1 more dumpling than each female.

Since each female eats 3 dumplings, each male must eat \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

So, the total number of dumplings eaten by all males is:
\[ \text{Total dumplings from males} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of dumplings eaten by all females.
- There are 6 females.
- Each female eats 3 dumplings.

So, the total number of dumplings eaten by all females is:
\[ \text{Total dumplings from females} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by everyone.
We know that there are no leftovers, so we can add the totals from both males and females to get the total number of dumplings Larry cooked:
\[ \text{Total dumplings} = \text{Dumplings from males} + \text{Dumplings from females} \]
\[ \text{Total dumplings} = 32 + 18 = 50 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the : ratio 3:2. ! If Gerald spent $10 on a book, how much money did he have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total parts in the ratio.
The given ratio for dividing $100 is 3:2. This means that there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of one part.
Since the total amount to be divided is $100, we divide this by the total number of parts (5):
\[ \text{Value per part} = \frac{\$100}{5} = \$20 \]

### Step 3: Find out how much Gerald has after spending some money.
Gerald spends $10 on a book. We need to subtract this from his initial share:
\[ \text{Initial share for Gerald} = \$20 \]
\[ \text{Amount left after spending} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

### Conclusion:
After spending $10 on a book, Gerald has $10 left.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: $10.<|im_end|>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.
So Gerald received $20 x 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.
Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the speed of the turtle**
- We know that Martha's cat runs at 15 feet per second.
- The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.
  
Let \( T \) represent the speed of the turtle.

Given that the cat’s speed (C) is 5 times the turtle’s speed (T), we have:
\[ C = 5T \]

Since the cat runs at 15 feet per second:
\[ 15 = 5T \]

Solve for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{5} \]
\[ T = 3 \text{ feet per second} \]

So, the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**

Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can calculate the distance it travels in 40 seconds.

Distance = Speed × Time

Substitute the values:
\[ Distance = 3 \times 40 \]
\[ Distance = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle crawls **120 feet** in 40 seconds.<|im_end|>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

                    question:
                    : The local firefighters are doing a ; “fill the boot” fundraiser. Their goal is to raise $6300. After the , first 3 ? hours, ? they have . raised $2100. .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money needs to be raised and then calculate the number of additional hours required based on the assumption that an equal amount is being raised per hour.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the remaining target:**
   - The total goal is $6300.
   - They have already raised $2100.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount to be raised is:
     \[
     6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average hourly rate:**
   - They have already worked for 3 hours.
   - Let \( h \) represent the number of additional hours needed to reach the goal.
   - The total time spent (including the initial 3 hours) will be \( 3 + h \).
   - If an equal amount is raised in each hour, let’s denote the amount raised per hour as \( x \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total amount raised after \( 3 + h \) hours should equal the remaining target ($4200):
     \[
     x(3 + h) = 4200
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we get:
     \[
     x = \frac{4200}{3 + h}
     \]

4. **Find the total number of hours required:**
   - We know they need to raise $4200 at the current rate \( x \) over \( 3 + h \) hours.
   - Since they aim to raise an equal amount in each hour, we can write:
     \[
     x(3 + h) = 4200
     \]
   - Substituting \( x \) from above into the equation, we get:
     \[
     \left(\frac{4200}{3 + h}\right)(3 + h) = 4200
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we see that:
     \[
     4200 = 4200
     \]
   - This confirms our setup is correct.

5. **Solve for \( h \):**
   - To find \( h \), we set up the equation:
     \[
     3 + h = \frac{4200}{x}
     \]
   - Since \( x \) cancels out when equating both sides, we simplify:
     \[
     h = \frac{4200}{\left(\frac{4200}{3+h}\right)}
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     h = 7
     \]

Therefore, they still need to fundraise for **7** hours to reach their goal.<|im_end|>","The fireman raise 2100 / 3 = $<<2100/3=700>>700 per hour.

   - Colorado, City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of water used for industrial purposes within Colorado, City:**
   - 80% of the water used by Colorado, City is used for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the remaining percentage of water used by Colorado, City after accounting for industrial use:**
   - Since 80% of the water used by Colorado, City is industrial, we subtract this from the total 40%.

\[
\text{Non-Industrial Water Used} = \text{Total Water Used} - \text{Water Used for Industrial}
\]

\[
\text{Non-Industrial Water Used} = 40\% - (40\% \times 80\%)

4. **Perform the calculation:**

\[
\text{Non-Industrial Water Used} = 40\% - (40\% \times 80\%) \\

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring based on her daily rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in 2 weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, \( 2 \text{ weeks} = 2 \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ days} \).

2. **Determine the cost per day:**
   - Alex charges $12 per day.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 14 days:**
   - Total cost = Number of days × Cost per day
   - Total cost = \( 14 \text{ days} \times \$12 \text{ per day} \)

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \( 14 \times 12 = 168 \).

Therefore, Alex charges **$168** for 2 weeks of tutoring.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much chocolate-ice cream and vanilla ice cream the factory can produce in 48 hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the production rate for chocolate-ice cream**

Given that the factory produces 100 quarts of chocolate-ice cream in 2 hours:

\[
\text{Production rate} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total production over 48 hours**

Using the production rate calculated above:

\[
\text{Total production in 48 hours} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
\]

So far, we have determined that the factory can produce **2400 quarts** of chocolate-ice cream in 48 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate the production rate for vanilla ice cream**

Given that the factory produces 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours:

\[
\text{Production rate} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total production over 48 hours**

Using the production rate calculated above:

\[
\text{Total production in 48 hours} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
\]

So far, we have determined that the factory can produce **600 quarts** of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours.

**Step 5: Sum up the total production**

Finally, adding the production rates together gives us the total production over 48 hours:

\[
\text{Total production in 48 hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts (chocolate)} + 600 \text{ quarts (vanilla)} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
\]

Therefore, the total amount produced in 48 hours is **3000 quarts**.<|im_end|>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.

In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Understand the offer**
- The offer is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.""
- Each scoop costs $1.50.

**Step 2: Determine the effective number of scoops per dollar spent**
Since each scoop costs $1.50, Erin needs to find out how much money she spends on 3 scoops (since buying 2 scoops gives her 1 for free).

\[ \text{Cost per 3 scoops} = 2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

This means that for every $3.00 she spends, she gets 3 scoops.

**Step 3: Calculate how many sets of 3 scoops she can afford**
Erin has $6.00.

\[ \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\$6.00}{\$3.00} = 2 \]

So, she can get 2 sets of 3 scoops.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of scoops**

                    question:
                    James decides to pick some blueberries.  It cost $20 to go picking ! and then another $1.5 per pound.  He . picked 30 pounds of blueberries. .  How much did he save compared to buying at the store for $2.5 a pound?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James would incur if he bought blueberries from the store and compare it to his budget for going picking.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying blueberries from the store.
James buys blueberries for $2.5 per pound. Since he picked 30 pounds of blueberries, the total cost for buying them would be:

\[ \text{Total Cost (Store)} = \text{Cost Per Pound} \times \text{Pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost (Store)} = \$2.5 \times 30 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total Cost (Store)} = \$75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of picking blueberries himself.
James pays $20 to go picking. Additionally, he has to pay $1.5 per pound for the blueberries. For 30 pounds, the cost would be:

\[ \text{Cost per Pound (Pickup)} = \$1.5 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost (Pickup)} = \text{Cost per Pound} \times \text{Pounds} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost (Pickup)} = \$1.5 \times 30 \]

Now let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total Cost (Pickup)} = \$45 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much James saved over the store price.
To find out how much James saved, we subtract the pickup cost from the store cost:

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total Cost (Store)} - \text{Total Cost (Pickup)} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$75 - \$45 \]

Finally, let's do the subtraction:

\[ \text{Savings} = \$30 \]

### Conclusion
James saved $30 by picking the blueberries himself instead of buying them from the store. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is The savings are } \$30}
\]<|im_end|>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original cost per computer
- The company originally planned to buy 500 computers with $700 each.

\[
\text{Original Cost per Computer} = \frac{\$700}{500} = \$1.40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the increased price per computer
- The price per computer increased by 10%.

\[
\text{Increased Price per Computer} = \$1.40 \times (1 + 0.10) = \$1.40 \times 1.10 = \$1.54
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of computers ordered
- They ordered 500 computers as initially planned.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on computers at the new prices
- Multiply the number of computers by the new price per computer.

\[
\text{Total Amount Spent} = 500 \times \$1.54 = \$770
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is **\$770**.<|im_end|>","When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the components of the omelet:**
   - The omelet contains eggs, cheese, and ham.

2. **Calculate the calorie content for each component:**
   
   - **Eggs:** Each egg has 75 calories.
     \[
     \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
     \]

   - **Cheese:** There are 2 ounces of cheese.
     \[
     \text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of ham used in the omelet:**
   - We need to find out how much ham is used in the omelet since we know that the amount of ham is equal to the amount of cheese (2 ounces).

4. **Calculate the total calorie content before adding ham:**
   \[
   \text{Total calories before adding ham} = 450 + 240 = 690 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. **Add the calories from ham to the total so far:**
   \[
   \text{Final calorie count after adding ham} = 690 + (2 \times 40) = 690 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the pencils:**
   - Each pencil costs $0.50.
   - Number of pencils = 6.

\[
\text{Total cost for pencils} = \text{Cost per pencil} \times \text{Number of pencils}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for pencils} = \$0.50 \times 6 = \$3.00
\]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the erasers:**
   - Each eraser costs $0.25.
   - Number of erasers = 8.

\[
\text{Total cost for erasers} = \text{Cost per eraser} \times \text{Number of erasers}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for erasers} = \$0.25 \times 8 = \$2.00

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost for pencils + Total cost for erasers.

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for pencils} + \text{Total cost for erasers}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00

4. **Calculate the change received:**
   - Amount paid - Total amount spent.

\[
\text{Change received} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total amount spent}
\]

\[
\text{Change received} = \$10.00 - \$5.00 = \$5.00

### Step 1: Calculate the number of people receiving interviews.
Given that 30% of the applicants receive interviews:

\[ \text{Number of interviewees} = 0.30 \times 100 = 30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people receiving a job offer.
Given that 20% of the interviewees receive a job offer:

\[ \text{Number of job offers} = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of people accepting the position.
Given that one-third of those who receive a job offer accept the position:

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many times Helga taps both her feet over a period of 5 minutes. We'll break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of taps per minute for each foot:**
   - Right foot: 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot: 250 taps per minute.

2. **Determine the total number of taps per minute when both arms are raised (slower rate):**
   - Combined tap rate = Right foot + Left foot = 300 taps/min + 250 taps/min = 550 taps/min.

3. **Calculate the number of taps per minute when both arms are not raised (higher rate):**
   - Combined tap rate = Right foot + Left foot = 300 taps/min + 250 taps/min = 550 taps/min.

4. **Calculate the number of taps per minute when just one arm is raised:**
   - Right foot tap rate = 300 taps/min.
   - Left foot tap rate = 250 taps/min.
   - Combined tap rate = Right foot + Left foot = 300 taps/min + 250 taps/min = 550 taps/min.

Now let's summarize these calculations:

- **When raising both arms:** The tap rate is reduced to 200 taps per minute.
- **When raising only one arm:** The tap rate is 300 taps per minute or 250 taps per minute.

Next, we determine how many taps occur within the given time periods:

1. **Total time spent dancing: 5 minutes.**

2. **Time spent with both arms raised (slower rate):** 
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{5}{200} \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time spent with just one arm raised (higher rate):**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{5}{300} \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{5}{250} \text{ minutes}
   \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of taps for each segment:

- **With both arms raised (slower rate):**
  \[
  \text{Taps} = \text{Time} \times \text{Tap Rate} = \left(\frac{5}{200}\right) \times 200 = 5 \text{ taps}
  \]

- **With just one arm raised (higher rate):**
  \[
  \text{Taps} = \text{Time} \times \text{Tap Rate} = \left(\frac{5}{300}\right) \times 300 = 5 \text{ taps}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Taps} = \text{Time} \times \text{Tap Rate} = \left(\frac{5}{250}\right) \times 250 = 5 \text{ taps}
  \]

Adding up all the taps gives us the total number of taps Helga performs in 5 minutes:

\[
\text{Total Taps} = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 \text{ taps}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 15 taps.<|im_end|>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and calculate the total costs:

1. **Calculate the damage potential:**
   - The damage to Ron's car is estimated at $450.

2. **Calculate the cost of buying and using asphalt:**
   - Ron needs 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Total cost for asphalt = 3 buckets * $25 per bucket = $75.

Now, let's sum these costs to find out how much Ron spends on fixing the pothole:

- Damage to car: $450
- Cost of asphalt: $75
- Total spent on repairs: $450 + $75 = $525

Finally, we'll determine how much money Ron saves by not having to pay fines or face legal consequences for doing the work himself:

- Fines from the city council: $120
- Total savings: $525 (total repair costs) - $120 (fine) = $405

So, Ron saves $405 by not having to deal with the city council's fines.

Therefore, the final answer is:

- 13 baby chairs are sent to the carpenter.

Total chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs sent + Baby chairs sent
= 20 + 13
= 33 chairs

**Step 3: Subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the initial total**
- Total chairs initially - Chairs sent for repair
= 193 - 33
= 160 chairs remaining

Therefore, the restaurant has **160 chairs** left after sending some for repair.<|im_end|>","Before sending the chairs and baby chairs to the carpenter the restaurant had 170 + 23 = <<170+23=193>>193 chairs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much pizza each person ate.
- **Bryce**: He ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his pizza.
- **Two friends (let's call them Alice and Bob)**: They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.

Since each pizza has 12 slices, we can calculate the number of slices they ate as follows:
- **Alice and Bob together**: 
\[ 2 \times \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 \right) = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So, Alice and Bob together ate 16 slices out of their total 12 slices.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining slices for each person.
- **Bryce**:
\[ 12 - \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
So, Bryce has 4 slices left.

- **Alice and Bob together**:
\[ 12 - 16 = -4 \] (This doesn't make sense because you can't have negative slices).

It seems there was an error in the initial assumption that both friends ate the same amount. Let's correct this.

- **Alice**:
\[ 12 - \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
So, Alice has 4 slices left.

- **Bob**:
\[ 12 - \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
So, Bob also has 4 slices left.

### Step 3: Determine how much pizza the last two friends ate.
- **Remaining friends** (the two who didn't eat yet):
- **Friend A**: He ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of his pizza.
- **Friend B**: He ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of his pizza.

Each friend has 12 slices, so:
- **Friend A**:
\[ 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9 \]

- **Friend B**:
\[ 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 9 \]

So, each of the remaining friends ate 9 slices.

### Step 4: Calculate the total slices eaten by all.
- Total slices eaten by the first group (Bryce and his two friends): \( 16 \)
- Total slices eaten by the second group (remaining friends): \( 9 + 9 = 18 \)

Total slices eaten:
\[ 16 + 18 = 34 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining slices.
- Since each pizza originally had 12 slices:
\[ 12 \times 4 = 48 \] (Total slices available initially)

Therefore, the number of slices left:
\[ 48 - 34 = 14 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{14}}
\]<|im_end|>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the time taken by the cat to eat all the sausages:**
   - The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.

2. **Calculate the rate at which the cat eats sausages:**
   - The cat's eating rate = \(\frac{9 \text{ sausages}}{30 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ sausages per minute}\).

3. **Determine the time taken by the dog to eat the same number of sausages:**
   - The dog eats the same number of sausages (9) but does so in \(\frac{3}{2}\) times longer than the cat.
   - Therefore, the dog takes \(30 \times \frac{3}{2} = 45\) minutes to eat all the sausages.

4. **Calculate the total time taken by both the cat and the dog together:**
   - Total time = Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog = 30 minutes + 45 minutes = 75 minutes.

5. **Find the average time taken by both animals:**
   - Average time = \(\frac{\text{Total time}}{2} = \frac{75 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 37.5\) minutes.

Therefore, the average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat all the sausages is \boxed{37.5} minutes.<|im_end|>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the given information about the lengths of their shoes.
3. Solve for the length of Bobby's shoe.

Let's start converting Topher's shoe length into inches:

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length:**
   - One foot equals 12 inches.
   - So, 8 feet = \(8 \times 12\) inches.
   - 4 inches remain as they are.
   - Total length of Topher's shoe = \(8 \times 12 + 4\) inches.

Now let's calculate it:

\[ 8 \times 12 = 96 \]
\[ 96 + 4 = 100 \]

So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

Next, we set up the equation according to the given information that the length of Topher's shoe (100 inches) is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe (\(x\)):

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

We'll now solve for \(x\):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).<|im_end|>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many windows Hannah smashed based on the given information about the number of cars and their windows.

1. **Calculate the total number of students' cars:**
   - There are 64 student cars.

2. **Determine the total number of windows in all student cars:**
   - Each car has 4 windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in all student cars is \( 64 \times 4 = 256 \) windows.

3. **Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashed from student cars:**
   - Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4th) of the student cars' windows.
   - The number of student cars is 64, so she smashes \( \frac{1}{4} \times 64 = 16 \) windows from the student cars.

4. **Calculate the number of teachers' cars:**
   - We know there are 32 teachers' cars.

5. **Determine the total number of windows in all teachers' cars:**
   - Each teacher's car has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in all teachers' cars is \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \) windows.

6. **Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashed from teachers' cars:**
   - Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4th) of the teachers' cars' windows.
   - The number of teachers' cars is 32, so she smashes \( \frac{3}{4} \times 32 = 24 \) windows from the teachers' cars.

7. **Add the number of windows smashed from both types of cars:**
   - Total windows smashed = Windows from student cars + Windows from teachers' cars
   - Total windows smashed = 16 (student cars) + 24 (teachers' cars)
   - Total windows smashed = 40

   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
   
   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150
   \]

2. **Determine the number of blue spools:**
   Since all spools mentioned are either blue or green, we add the number of blue spools.

   Number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60
   
3. **Calculate the percentage of blue spools:**
   The formula for calculating the percentage is:

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much gum Parker uses in one day**
- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day.

**Step 2: Determine how much gum Parker needs for 30 days**
- Total pieces of gum needed = Pieces per day * Days

To determine how many boxes of Graham crackers are needed, we'll break this down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of Smores desired
- There are 9 kids, each wanting 2 Smores.
- Therefore, the total number of Smores requested from kids = \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \).

- There are 6 adults, each wanting 1 Smore.
- Therefore, the total number of Smores requested from adults = \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \).

- Adding these together gives us the total number of Smores required:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ Smores} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of Smores one sleeve can make
Each sleeve of Graham crackers makes enough Smores to cover the base for 8 large Smores.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of sleeves needed
Since there are 24 Smores in total, we divide this by the number of Smores made per sleeve:
\[ \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of boxes needed
There are 3 sleeves that are needed for the total Smores. Since each box contains 3 sleeves (one sleeve per box), we calculate:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ F = 2D + 8 \]

Substitute \(D = 15\) into the equation:
\[ F = 2 \times 15 + 8 \]
\[ F = 30 + 8 \]
\[ F = 38 \]

So, Dora's father is **38** years old.

### Step 2: Determine Dora's Mother's Age
Now that we know Dora's father's age, we can determine Dora's mother's age.

It's stated that Dora's mother is ""four years younger"" than Dora's father. Let \(M\) represent Dora's mother's age. Then:
\[ M = F - 4 \]

Substituting \(F = 38\) into the equation:
\[ M = 38 - 4 \]
\[ M = 34 \]

So, Dora's mother is **34** years old.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Combined Age
To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together.

Therefore:
\[ \text{Total Combined Age} = D + F + M \]

Substitute \(D = 15\), \(F = 38\), and \(M = 34\):
\[ \text{Total Combined Age} = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ \text{Total Combined Age} = 97 \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is **97** years.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{97}
\]<|im_end|>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the weight of Cindy's books:**
   - Math books: Each weighs 2 pounds.
     Number of math books = 5 (since we need to calculate for one full set plus any extra books).
     Total weight of math books = \(5 \times 2\) pounds.

   - Science books: Each weighs 2 pounds.
     Number of science books = 6 (since we need to calculate for one full set plus any extra books).
     Total weight of science books = \(6 \times 2\) pounds.

   - French book: Weighs 4 pounds.
     This is a single book, so its weight is just 4 pounds.

   - English book: Weighs 3 pounds.
     This is also a single book, so its weight is just 3 pounds.

   - History book: Weighs twice as much as the English book.
     Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs \(2 \times 3\) pounds.

2. **Sum up the weights of all books:**
   - Math books: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds.
   - Science books: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) pounds.
   - French book: \(4\) pounds.
   - English book: \(3\) pounds.
   - History book: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

3. **Add up all the weights together:**
   Total weight = \(10 + 12 + 4 + 3 + 6\) pounds.

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[
10 + 12 = 22
\]
\[
22 + 4 = 26
\]
\[
26 + 3 = 29
\]
\[
29 + 6 = 35

To determine how many votes candidate C received, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Candidate A's Votes
- Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
- Total number of voters = 100.

\[
\text{Votes for candidate A} = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Candidate B's Votes
- Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
  
Since candidate A received 20 votes:

\[
\text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + (20 \times 0.5) = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Remaining Votes for Candidate C
- Total votes - votes for candidates A and B = votes for candidate C.

\[
\text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B})
\]

Substitute the values we have calculated:

\[
\text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is: 50}<|im_end|>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.

Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of apples Beck initially has**

Boris has 100 apples. Since Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, we can calculate the number of apples Beck has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of apples Beck has} = \text{Number of apples Boris has} - 23 \]
\[ \text{Number of apples Beck has} = 100 - 23 \]
\[ \text{Number of apples Beck has} = 77 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of apples given from Boris to Beck**

If Boris gives 10 apples to Beck, we need to subtract these 10 apples from Boris's original amount.

\[ \text{Remaining apples for Boris after giving away 10 apples} = \text{Original number of apples Boris had} - 10 \]
\[ \text{Remaining apples for Boris} = 100 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Remaining apples for Boris} = 90 \]

Now, let's see how many apples are left in Beck's possession after receiving 10 apples.

\[ \text{Apples left for Beck after receiving 10 apples} = \text{Initial number of apples Beck had} + 10 \]
\[ \text{Apples left for Beck} = 77 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Apples left for Beck} = 87 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris**

Finally, we find out how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris by subtracting the remaining number of apples on both sides.

\[ \text{Difference between remaining apples} = \text{Remaining apples for Boris} - \text{Remaining apples for Beck} \]
\[ \text{Difference between remaining apples} = 90 - 87 \]
\[ \text{Difference between remaining apples} = 3 \]

So, Beck still has **3 more apples** than Boris.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{3}}
\]<|im_end|>","Boris has 100 apples, but gives 10 away, so now he has 100 apples - 10 apples = <<100-10=90>>90 apples.

However, since he gets 10 from Boris, he now has 77 apples + 10 apples = <<77+10=87>>87 apples.
Thus Beck has 90 - 87 = <<90-87=3>>3 apples fewer than Boris.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each size of ice cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes.
- Giant cubes use 4 ounces per cube.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
Total water used = 4 * 3 = 12 ounces.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes.
- Medium cubes use 2 ounces per cube.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
Total water used = 2 * 7 = 14 ounces.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes.
- Small cubes use 0.5 ounces per cube.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
Total water used = 0.5 * 8 = 4 ounces.

Step 4: Sum up all the water used for each type of cube.
Total water used = 12 (giant) + 14 (medium) + 4 (small) = 30 ounces.

Step 5: Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water.
Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.
Remaining water = 32 - 30 = 2 ounces.

Therefore, after making all the ice cubes, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.<|im_end|>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Steven has.
2. Calculate how many books Alice has based on the information given.
3. Compare the number of books Clara has to the number of books Alice has.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Determine how many books Steven has.
- We know that Clara has twice as many books as Steven.
- Clara has 20 books.
- Therefore, if \( C \) represents the number of books Clara has, then \( C = 2S \).
- Since \( C = 20 \), we can find \( S \):
\[ 20 = 2S \]
\[ S = \frac{20}{2} \]
\[ S = 10 \]

So, Steven has 10 books.

Next, let's move to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate how many books Alice has.
- We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Alice has.
- According to the problem, \( A = S + 6 \).
- Since \( S = 10 \), we can find \( A \):
\[ A = 10 + 6 \]
\[ A = 16 \]

Therefore, Alice has 16 books.

Finally, let's compare the number of books Clara has to the number of books Alice has:

Step 3: Compare the number of books Clara has to the number of books Alice has.
- Clara has 20 books.
- Alice has 16 books.
- To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of a half-gallon jar
Given that a gallon jar costs $5, which is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can set up an equation to find the price of a half-gallon jar.

Let \( H \) represent the price of a half-gallon jar in dollars.

We know:
\[ G = H + 2 \]

where \( G \) is the price of a gallon jar ($5).

Substitute \( G \) into the equation:
\[ 5 = H + 2 \]

Solve for \( H \):
\[ H = 5 - 2 \]
\[ H = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons of milk
Cecelia buys 10 gallons of milk at the rate of $5 per gallon.

Total cost for 10 gallons:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times \$5 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$50 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallons of milk
Cecelia also buys 16 half-gallons of milk at the rate of $3 per half-gallon.

Total cost for 16 half-gallons:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 16 \times \$3 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$48 \]

### Step 4: Sum the total costs from both types of jars
Finally, add the two amounts together to get the total expenditure:
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \$50 + \$48 \]
\[ \text{Total Expenditure} = \$98 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students in the class like to play video games given the conditions about their hobbies.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Total number of students = 50
   - Number of students who like to bake (and therefore do not like other activities) = 10
   - Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
   - The remaining students like either to play video games or to play music.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of students who like to play video games.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of students who like to play music.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Students:**
   Since there are 50 students in total and 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball, the number of students left for the other two hobbies combined must equal the remaining number after accounting for those who like to bake and play basketball:
   \[
   x + y = 50 - (10 + 5) = 35
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation Based on the Condition:**
   We know from the problem statement that the number of students who like to play music (\( y \)) is twice the number of students who prefer to play basketball (\( y = 2 \times 5 \)):
   \[
   y = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   
4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Substitute \( y = 10 \) into the equation \( x + y = 35 \):
   \[
   x + 10 = 35
   \]
   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[
   x = 35 - 10 = 25
   \]

### Final Answer:
The number of students who like to play video games is {The final answer is} 25.<|im_end|>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

Let's calculate how many birds were scared away:

\[
\text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

So, after throwing the stone, Jeremy has \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds left.

2. **Add the 20 additional birds that join later:**

Now, let's add the 20 additional birds to the remaining 8 birds:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of students per class:**
   - We know that there are two classes.
   - The total number of students in both classes combined is 80.

2. **Calculate the number of students per class:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students per class} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the percentage of boys in each class:**
   - It is given that 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   - Therefore, 60% of the students in each class must be boys (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

4. **Calculate the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since each class has 40 students,
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in each class} = 0.60 \times 40 = 24
   \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(24\).<|im_end|>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

   - The plate initially has 2 slices.
   
2. **Adding Slices**:
   - Mara adds 3 more slices to the plate.
   - Total slices = 2 + 3 = 5.

3. **Getting Hungrier**:
   - Mara gets hungrier and triples the number of slices on the plate.
   - New total = 5 × 3 = 15.

4. **Eating Slices**:
   - Mara eats 2 slices from the plate.
   - Remaining slices after eating = 15 - 2 = 13.

5. **Stolen Slices**:
   - Her friend steals 5 slices from the plate.
   - Final count = 13 - 5 = 8.

So, the number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.

To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of different types of animals she needs to groom. Then, we divide this total by the number of days in a week (7) to find out how many animals she can groom per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of different types of animals.
- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Total number of different types of animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28

Step 2: Determine how many animals she can groom each day.
Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7.

Number of animals per day = Total number of animals / Number of days

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much profit Mark made from selling his Magic Card Packs, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying the packs.
Mark bought 3 packs at $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total value of all the cards Mark received.
He got two specific cards and an average number of other cards.

- The first pack contains one card worth $4000.
- The second pack contains one card worth $1000.
- The third pack contains an average of 30 cards, each worth $50.

First, calculate the total value of the two specific cards:

\[
\text{Value of specific cards} = \$4000 + \$1000 = \$5000
\]

Next, calculate the total value of the 30 average cards:

\[
\text{Value of average cards} = 30 \times \$50 = \$1500
\]

Now, sum up the values of both sets of cards:

\[
\text{Total Value} = \$5000 + \$1500 = \$6500
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the total value to find the profit.
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Value} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = \$6500 - \$5400 = \$1100
\]

### Final Answer:
\boxed{\$1100}<|im_end|>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500

                    question:
                    Jake's family wants to compare the cost of the two different amusement parks. The first amusement park has a $26 fee for each adult ! and a $12 fee for each child; while the second amusement park has ! a $14 fee for each : adult and . $10 for each child.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Jake's family would save by choosing the second amusement park, we need to calculate the total cost for both parks and then find the difference between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at the first amusement park

- **Adults' Cost**:
  - First amusement park charges $26 per adult.
  - There are 2 adults.
  - Total cost for adults = \( 2 \times \$26 = \$52 \).

- **Children's Cost**:
  - First amusement park charges $12 per child.
  - There are 2 children.
  - Total cost for children = \( 2 \times \$12 = \$24 \).

- **Total Cost at First Amusement Park**:
  - Sum of costs for adults and children = \( \$52 + \$24 = \$76 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at the second amusement park

- **Adults' Cost**:
  - Second amusement park charges $14 per adult.
  - There are 2 adults.
  - Total cost for adults = \( 2 \times \$14 = \$28 \).

- **Children's Cost**:
  - Second amusement park charges $10 per child.
  - There are 2 children.
  - Total cost for children = \( 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \).

- **Total Cost at Second Amusement Park**:
  - Sum of costs for adults and children = \( \$28 + \$20 = \$48 \).

### Step 3: Determine the savings

- **Savings**:
  - Savings = Total cost at first park - Total cost at second park
  - Savings = \$76 - \$48 = \$28.

Therefore, Jake's family can save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park.<|im_end|>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost per day.
2. Determine the daily savings.
3. Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost per day**

- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes per day.
- Each tomato was originally sold at $0.50.
- Therefore, the total cost per day before switching vendors is \(500 \times \$0.50 = \$250\).

**Step 2: Determine the daily savings**

- Now that the vendor buys tomatoes from another seller who sells them for $0.40 each.
- So, the selling price per tomato has decreased from $0.50 to $0.40.
- This means the vendor now pays $0.40 instead of $0.50 for each tomato.
- Therefore, the saving per tomato is \(\$0.50 - \$0.40 = \$0.10\).
- Since the vendor sells 500 tomatoes per day, the daily savings amount to \(500 \times \$0.10 = \$50\).

**Step 3: Multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- Therefore, the weekly savings amount to \(7 \times \$50 = \$350\).

Thus, the tomato vendor saves **$350** in a week.<|im_end|>","He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many marbles Sean has:**
   - We know that Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Calculate how many marbles Carl has based on Sean's number:**
   - Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   - Therefore, Carl's number of marbles = \(4 \times 56\).

3. **Calculate how many marbles Cal has based on Sean's number:**
   - Since Cal has half as many marbles as Sean, we can find Cal's number of marbles using the formula for half of Sean's total marbles.
   - Therefore, Cal's number of marbles = \(\frac{56}{2}\).

Now let's perform these calculations:

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has \(4 \times 56 = 224\) marbles.
3. Cal has \(\frac{56}{2} = 28\) marbles.

1. **Determine the total number of groups required initially:**
   - We know that the activity requires 12 groups.

2. **Calculate the current number of groups formed:**
   - There are 54 students.
   - To find out how many students are in each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out over two four-week periods.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the weekly rentals for both weekdays and weekends:**
   - Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs/week.
   - Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs/week.

2. **Determine the monthly rentals based on the given time frame:**
   - There are typically 4 weeks in a month, so let's assume each month has exactly 4 weeks.
   - Weekly rentals: \( 300 \text{ chairs} + 200 \text{ chairs} = 500 \text{ chairs/month} \).

3. **Calculate the total rentals over two such months:**
   - Total monthly rentals: \( 500 \text{ chairs/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1000 \text{ chairs} \).

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out over two 4-week months is:

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initially, Gunther has 48 bananas.

2. Arnold steals half of these bananas:

5. Arnold then steals some more bananas:
   49 ÷ 2 ≈ 24 (since we can't steal partial bananas, let's round down)
   
6. After Arnold's second theft, Gunther has:
   49 - 24 = 25 bananas left.

7. Gunther adds 6 more bananas on the third day:
   25 + 6 = 31 bananas total.

Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

     100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1200 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

4. **Divide the total annual cost among the roommates:**
   - Since there are 4 roommates sharing the cost equally, we need to divide the total annual cost by 4.
     \[
     \frac{1200 \text{ dollars/year}}{4 \text{ roommates}} = 300 \text{ dollars/year per roommate}
     \]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: $\boxed{300}$<|im_end|>","There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.
Since there are 5 roommates, each roommate will pay 1200/5=$<<1200/5=240>>240 in a year.

                    question:
                    Jeff owns a catering ? company.  : During . a recent event, : he sent . 8 ! dozen , glasses ! and 4 dozen plates for the party.  When they were returned, 10 glasses were ! broken as well as 6 ; plates.  How many ? glasses ; and plates does Jeff have now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of glasses initially sent:**
   - Jeff sends 8! dozens of glasses.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, we need to convert the ! sign into multiplication by 12.
   - \( 8! \times 12 = 8! \times 12 \)

2. **Calculate the total number of plates initially sent:**
   - Jeff sends 4! dozens of plates.
   - Again, converting the ! symbol to multiplication by 12.
   - \( 4! \times 12 = 4! \times 12 \)

3. **Convert factorials to numbers (if not already):**
   - Factorial notation (!) can be converted to actual numbers using the definition of factorial:
     - \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \)
     - \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \)

4. **Perform the calculations:**
   - Let's calculate these values assuming you have access to a calculator or computer capable of handling large numbers.

5. **Subtract the broken items from the initial quantities:**
   - Glasses: 
     - Initial quantity: \( 8! \times 12 \)
     - Broken: 10
     - Remaining: \( 8! \times 12 - 10 \)
   - Plates:
     - Initial quantity: \( 4! \times 12 \)
     - Broken: 6
     - Remaining: \( 4! \times 12 - 6 \)

6. **Final calculation:**
   - After subtracting the broken items, compute the remaining quantity of both glasses and plates.

Let's assume the calculations yield certain results based on the given data:
- If \( 8! = 40320 \), then \( 8! \times 12 = 483360 \).
- If \( 4! = 24 \), then \( 4! \times 12 = 288 \).

So, Jeff originally had:
- \( 483360 \) glasses.
- \( 288 \) plates.

After the return:
- Glass count: \( 483360 - 10 = 483350 \) glasses.
- Plate count: \( 288 - 6 = 282 \) plates.

Therefore, Jeff has:
- \( 483350 \) glasses.
- \( 282 \) plates.

This concludes that Jeff now has \( 483350 \) glasses and \( 282 \) plates after returning some due to damage. The final answer is:
{The final answer is} \( 483350 \) glasses and \( 282 \) plates.<|im_end|>","He had 8 dozen glasses so he had 8*12 = <<8*12=96>>96 glasses

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of small stickers traded:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of these small stickers.
   - Number of small stickers traded = \( 30 \times 0.90 = 27 \)

2. **Calculate the value of the traded small stickers in terms of large buttons:**
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button.
   - Therefore, 27 small stickers are worth 27 small buttons.

3. **Determine how many large buttons can be obtained from the traded small stickers:**
   - Each large button costs 3 small stickers.
   - To find out how many large buttons can be bought with 27 small stickers, we divide 27 by 3 (since each large button requires 3 small stickers).
   - Number of large buttons = \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

4. **Determine the remaining small stickers after trading:**
   - Initial small stickers: 30
   - Traded small stickers: 27
   - Remaining small stickers = \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)

5. **Trade the remaining small stickers for large buttons:**
   - Since there were no large buttons available initially, all 3 remaining small stickers will trade to large buttons.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button, so 3 small stickers will trade for 3 small buttons.
   - Value of these 3 small buttons in terms of large buttons:
     - Each large button costs 3 small stickers, so 3 small buttons are worth \( \frac{3}{3} = 1 \) large button.
     - Total large buttons = 1 (from the remaining small stickers).

6. **Sum up the total number of large buttons obtained:**
   - Large buttons from traded small stickers: 9
   - Large buttons from remaining small stickers: 1
   - Total large buttons = \( 9 + 1 = 10 \) large buttons.

7. **Calculate the total number of large buttons used:**
   - Initially, Lorraine had 40 large stickers.
   - She trades away 90% of her small stickers, which results in 9 large buttons from those stickers.
   - Trade away 50% of her large stickers, which means she trades away \( 0.50 \times 40 = 20 \) large buttons.
   - Total large buttons used = \( 9 + 20 = 29 \).

8. **Final count of large buttons:**
   - Starting with 40 large stickers.
   - Used 29 large buttons.
   - Final count of large buttons = \( 40 - 29 = 11 \) large buttons.

Therefore, Lorraine ends up with **11 large buttons** at the end.<|im_end|>","She trades 27 small stickers because 30 x .9 = <<27=27>>27

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many matches Joey played in total over the course of his week.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the number of matches for each day:**
   - On Monday: \( \text{2} \)
   - On Friday: \( \text{1} \)
   - On Saturday: \( \text{Double the number of matches on Monday} \)

2. **Calculate the number of matches on Saturday:**
   Since the number of matches on Saturday is double that of Monday,
   \[
   \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Matches on Monday}
   \]
   Substituting the value from Monday (which is 2):
   \[
   \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

3. **Sum up all the matches for the entire week:**
   Add the number of matches for each day together:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = \text{Monday} + \text{Friday} + \text{Saturday}
   \]
   Substituting the values calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7
   \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of votes that were in favor of the new regulation.

2. **Understand the Relationship Between Votes:**
   According to the problem, ""twice as many votes in favor"" means the number of votes in favor (x) is double the number of votes against (y). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   x = 2y
   \]

3. **Determine Total Number of Council Members:**
   There are 33 people on the council. Let \( y \) be the number of votes against the new regulation. Since the total number of votes must equal 33:
   \[
   x + y = 33
   \]

4. **Substitute the Value from Step 2 into Step 3:**
   Substitute \( x = 2y \) into \( x + y = 33 \):
   \[
   2y + y = 33
   \]
   Simplify this equation:
   \[
   3y = 33
   \]
   Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{33}{3} = 11
   \]

5. **Find the Number of Votes In Favor:**
   Now that we know \( y = 11 \), substitute back into \( x = 2y \) to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]<|im_end|>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.

Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students in each shirt size category and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-Small (ES)**: 
   - Number of ES students = 11

2. **Small (S)**:
   - Number of S students = 2 * ES students = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M)**:
   - Number of M students = S students - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L)**:
   - Number of L students = M students / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-Large (XL)**:
   - Number of XL students = L students + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, let's add up all the students:

- Extra-Small (ES): 11
- Small (S): 22
- Medium (M): 18
- Large (L): 9
- Extra-Large (XL): 15

Total number of shirts needed = ES + S + M + L + XL = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The original price of the item in the bag is $140.

Step 2: Determine the discount rate.
The bag offers a 5% discount on its price.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of the discount.
To find out how much the discount amounts to, we multiply the original price by the discount rate (expressed as a decimal).

Discount = Original Price × Discount Rate
= $140 × 0.05
= $7

Step 4: Subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price.
Final Price = Original Price - Discount

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of songs per playlist.
We know that there are 300 songs in one playlist.

Step 2: Calculate the length of time for all 20 playlists combined.
Since each playlist contains 300 songs, and each song takes 10 hours, we can find the total length of time for one playlist by multiplying the number of songs by the length of each song.

\[ \text{Length of one playlist} = 300 \times 10 \]

Step 3: Multiply the length of one playlist by the total number of playlists (20).

\[ \text{Total length for 20 playlists} = (\text{Length of one playlist}) \times (\text{Number of playlists})

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people in total think that horse #12 will win the big race. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win initially.
- We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #12 will win.
- Calculate 20% of 50:
  \[
  0.20 \times 50 = 10
  \]
So, 10 people initially think that horse #12 will win.

### Step 2: Determine the number of people left after accounting for those who think horse #12 will win.
- Subtract the 10 people from the initial 50:
  \[
  50 - 10 = 40
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of people who think horse #2 will win given the remaining 40 people.
- We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #2 will win.
- Calculate 60% of 40:
  \[
  0.60 \times 40 = 24
  \]
So, 24 people think that horse #2 will win.

### Step 4: Determine the number of people who think horse #7 will win given the remaining 16 people (after considering those who think horse #2).
- We know that 40% of the remaining 16 people think horse #7 will win.
- Calculate 40% of 16:
  \[
  0.40 \times 16 = 6.4
  \]
Since the number of people must be a whole number, we round 6.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 6.

### Step 5: Determine the number of people who do not think any of these horses will win.
- Subtract the sum of those who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the remaining 16:
  \[
  16 - (24 + 6) = 16 - 30 = -14
  \]
This indicates an error in our calculation or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the steps carefully.

### Re-evaluation:
- After determining that 10 people thought horse #12 would win, the remaining 40 people should have been considered.
- Of these 40, 24 thought horse #2 would win.
- This leaves 16 people remaining because \(40 - 24 = 16\).

### Final Calculation:
- Out of these 16 people, 6 thought horse #7 would win.
- Therefore, the number of people who did not think any of these horses would win is:
  \[
  16 - (24 + 6) = 16 - 30 = -14
  \]
This still doesn't make sense. Let's correct the approach:

### Correct Approach:
- Initially, 10 people thought horse #12 would win.
- Then, out of the remaining 40, 24 thought horse #2 would win.
- So, 16 people remained.
- Among these 16, 6 thought horse #7 would win.
- Thus, the remaining \(16 - (24 + 6)\) does not apply correctly here.

Revisiting the logic:
- 10 people thought horse #12 would win initially.
- Then, 24 more thought horse #2 would win among the remaining 40.
- This means 16 were left.
- 6 of them thought horse #7 would win among the remaining 16.
- Hence, no one else could possibly think horse #12 would win since all others have already been ruled out.

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

                    question:
                    Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. One : third of : the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how : many puppies does Jana have?

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the total number of puppies Jana has.

2. **Determine Pomeranian Puppy Count:**
   According to the problem, two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}x \).

3. **Determine Number of Girls Among Pomeranians:**
   It is given that one-third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   So, the number of Pomeranian girls is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{9}x \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   We know from the problem statement that there are 6 Pomeranian girls.
   Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}x = 6
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{9}x = 6
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
   \[
   x = 6 \times \frac{9}{2}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 3 \times 9
   \]
   \[
   x = 27

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps.

1. **Calculate how much money Ava gives Jayden:**
   - Ava has an allowance of $90.
   - She decides to give half of it to Jayden.
   - Half of $90 is calculated as \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \).

So far, we have:
- Jayden's initial amount from selling pictures: $70
- Ava's allowance: $90
- Amount given by Ava: $45

2. **Add the amounts together to find out how much money Jayden now has:**
   - Jayden's initial amount + Ava's contribution = $70 + $45 = $115

So far, we have:
- Jayden's total current amount: $115

3. **Subtract the cost of the camera from Jayden's total amount:**
   - The camera costs $200.
   - Subtracting this from Jayden's total: $115 - $200 = -$85

Since Jayden cannot owe any money (he already has more than enough), we conclude:

**Jayden needs no additional funds to buy the camera.**

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cases of shingles each home will require based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Given Data:
1. The total number of cases needed for all three houses is **250**.
2. The first house needs half as much shingles as the second house.
3. The third house needs twice as much shingles as the first house.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) = number of cases needed for the first house,
- \( y \) = number of cases needed for the second house,
- \( z \) = number of cases needed for the third house.

From the given data, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( x + y + z = 250 \)
2. \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \)
3. \( z = 2x \)

### Step 1: Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \).

Since \( x = \frac{1}{2}y \), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 2x \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( y \) into the other equations.

Substitute \( y = 2x \) into the equation \( x + y + z = 250 \):
\[ x + 2x + z = 250 \]
\[ 3x + z = 250 \]

Next, substitute \( z = 2x \) into the equation \( 3x + z = 250 \):
\[ 3x + 2x = 250 \]
\[ 5x = 250 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{250}{5} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

### Step 3: Find \( y \) using \( x \).

Now that we know \( x = 50 \), we can find \( y \):
\[ y = 2x \]
\[ y = 2 \times 50 \]
\[ y = 100 \]

### Step 4: Find \( z \) using \( x \).

Finally, we can find \( z \):
\[ z = 2x \]
\[ z = 2 \times 50 \]
\[ z = 100 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the third house will need **100** cases of shingles.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of fruits George has, given that he has 45% more pears than bananas.

1. **Determine the number of pears:**
   - We know that George has 200 bananas.
   - According to the problem, George has 45% more pears than bananas.
   - First, calculate 45% of the number of bananas (which is 200):
     \[
     0.45 \times 200 = 90
     \]
   - This means George has 90 additional pears beyond the 200 bananas.
   - Therefore, the total number of pears is:
     \[
     200 + 90 = 290
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - The total number of fruits George has is the sum of the bananas and pears.
   - So, the total number of fruits is:
     \[
     200 \text{ bananas} + 290 \text{ pears} = 490

### Conclusion:
George has a total of 490 fruits.

   - Marissa starts with $80.

2. **Determine the cost of the ball:**
   - The ball costs $20.
   
3. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the ball:**
   - Subtract the cost of the ball from the initial amount:
     \[
     80 - 20 = 60
     \]
   So, Marissa has $60 left after purchasing the ball.

4. **Identify the price of one candy bar:**
   - Each candy bar costs $5.

5. **Calculate the number of candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money:**
   - Divide the remaining money by the price of one candy bar:
     \[

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs for 4 liters of juice and then calculate the total cost based on that information.

Step 1: Determine the amount of oranges needed per liter.
Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice. Therefore, he will need:

\[ \text{Oranges per liter} = 5 \, \text{kilograms/liter} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
Since Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for every liter, for 4 liters he will need:

\[ \text{Total oranges needed} = 5 \, \text{kilograms/liter} \times 4 \, \text{liters} = 20 \, \text{kilograms} \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, for 20 kilograms of oranges, the total cost will be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \, \text{kilograms} \times \$3/\text{kilogram} = \$60 \]

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $\boxed{60}$ dollars to make 4 liters of juice.<|im_end|>","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many books Ahmed read in the first hour**

Given that Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed in an hour, we can set up a ratio:
\[ \text{Ezra's books} = 2 \times \text{Ahmed's books} \]

We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour. Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.

So,
\[ 2A = 300 \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} \]
\[ A = 150 \]

Therefore, Ahmed read 150 books in one hour.

**Step 2: Calculate how many books Ahmed will read after deciding to read 150 more**

Since Ahmed decides to read 150 more books, his total will be:
\[ 150 + 150 = 300 \]

**Step 3: Find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed together**

Adding their individual totals:
\[ \text{Total books} = \text{Ezra's books} + \text{Ahmed's books} \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 300 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Total books} = 600 \]

To calculate how much Tanya earned over the two days, we need to break down her earnings from both days separately and then sum them up.

**Day 1:**
- **Number of classes**: 4
- **Hours per class**: 5 hours
- **Total hours worked**: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) hours
- **Earnings per hour**: $15
- **Total earnings for hours worked**: \(20 \times 15 = 300\)

Since she taught more than 3 classes (she taught 4), she gets an extra payment of $5/day for each class beyond 3.
- **Extra payments for classes above 3**: \(4 - 3 = 1\) class
- **Extra earnings for this class**: \(1 \times 5 = 5\)
- **Total extra earnings for Day 1**: \(5\)

So, her total earnings for Day 1 are:

- Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell.
- Let \( x \) be the price per ear of corn.
- Revenue from corn = \( 25x \).
- We know that this revenue must equal the remaining amount needed, which is $75.
- Therefore, we set up the equation: 
\[ 25x = 75 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
- Divide both sides of the equation by 25:
\[ x = \frac{75}{25} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

### Conclusion:
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3** to reach his goal of making a total of $135.<|im_end|>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $75 / 25 = $<<75/25=3>>3

                    question:
                    Tatiana is , deciding : how much of her weekend she wants to spend playing . soccer. ; She has 7 ! hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. : She is dividing her time : between soccer, , video games, and : reading.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Hours in the Weekend:**
   - Saturday: 7 hours
   - Sunday: 5 hours
   - Total = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

2. **Time Spent Reading and Playing Video Games:**
   - Time spent reading: 3 hours
   - Time spent playing video games: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining time after reading.

First, calculate the remaining time after spending 3 hours reading:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Next, find out how many hours were spent playing video games:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on reading and playing video games is:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

3. **Remaining Time for Soccer:**
   - Total weekend hours minus the time spent on other activities:
     \[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Tatiana spends **6 hours** playing soccer during her weekend.

4. **Percentage Calculation:**

To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{\text{Hours playing soccer}}{\text{Total weekend hours}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Hence, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]<|im_end|>","She has 12 hours for her activities because 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12

After video games she has 6 hours left for soccer because 9 - 3 = <<6=6>>6
The proportion of time spend on soccer is .5 because 6 / 12 = <<6/12=.5>>.5
The percentage of time spent on soccer is 50 because .5 x 100 = <<50=50>>50

1. Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Brandon.
2. Calculate the number of pencils left after giving some to Brandon.
3. Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Charlie from the remaining pencils.
4. Calculate the number of pencils left after giving some to Charlie.
5. Find out how many pencils Anthony keeps.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Brandon
Anthony has 50 pencils initially. He gives half of them to Brandon.

\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

So, Anthony gives 25 pencils to Brandon.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils left after giving some to Brandon
After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils left with Anthony is:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after Brandon} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Charlie
Next, Anthony gives three-fifths of the remaining pencils (which is now 25) to Charlie.

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

So, Anthony gives 15 pencils to Charlie.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of pencils left after giving some to Charlie
After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils left with Anthony is:

\[ \text{Remaining pencils after Charlie} = 25 - 15 = 10 \]

### Step 5: Find out how many pencils Anthony keeps
Finally, Anthony keeps the remaining 10 pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils that Anthony keeps is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]<|im_end|>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils

Thus, Anthony gave away 25 + 15 = <<25+15=40>>40 pencils.
Therefore, Anthony kept 50 - 40 = <<50-40=10>>10 pencils.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent driving
First, let's calculate how long Jack spends driving between his home and the museum. We know that the distance is 150 miles and he drives at a speed of 75 mph.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Jack spends 2 hours driving one way.

### Step 2: Add the time spent at the museum
We also know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, we add these two times together:

\[
\text{Total Time Spent} = \text{Driving Time} + \text{Museum Time}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time Spent} = 2 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Jack is gone for a total of 8 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent driving back home
Now, we need to calculate how long Jack spends driving back home. Since he has already driven half the distance (150 miles / 2 = 75 miles), the remaining distance is also 75 miles. His speed remains the same at 75 mph.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

So, Jack spends another 1 hour driving back home.

### Step 4: Sum up all the time spent on the trip
Finally, we sum up all the time Jack spent on the trip:

\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = \text{Drive to Museum} + \text{Drive Back Home} + \text{At Museum}
\]
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} + 6 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Jack is gone for a total of **9 hours** from home.<|im_end|>","He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:**
   - Each car requires 4 wheels.
   - There are 57 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total wheels for cars} = 57 \times 4 = 228
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles:**
   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
   - There are 73 motorcycles.
   \[
   \text{Total wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \times 2 = 146

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the discounted price of the laptop after applying the 20% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.
- The original price of the laptop is $1000.
- A 20% discount means that 20% of $1000 will be deducted from the original price.

Discount calculation:
\[ \text{Discount} = 1000 \times \frac{20}{100} = 1000 \times 0.2 = 200 \]

So, the discount amount is $200.

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the new price.
- New price = Original price - Discount
\[ \text{New Price} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after applying the 20% discount, you would have to pay $800 for the laptop.

<|im_start|>sys
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of movies that are not part of any series.
Mike starts with 600 movies. According to the information provided, three out of these six hundred movies are from various series. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \]

Subtracting the number of movies in series from the total gives us the number of non-series movies:

\[ \text{Non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

### Step 2: Determine the cost for the series movies.
Each series movie costs $6 more than its original price. Since each normal movie costs $10, the cost per series movie would be:

\[ \text{Cost per series movie} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, we multiply this cost by the number of series movies (200):

\[ \text{Total cost for series movies} = 200 \times 16 = 3200 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of non-series movies.
After removing the series movies, we have 400 non-series movies left.

### Step 4: Determine the cost for the non-series movies.
Since the cost for an older movie is given as $5, we now calculate the total cost for all non-series movies:

\[ \text{Total cost for non-series movies} = 400 \times 5 = 2000 \]

### Step 5: Sum up both types of movies to find the total cost.
Finally, we add the total cost for series movies and non-series movies to get the overall replacement cost:

\[ \text{Total replacement cost} = 3200 + 2000 = 5200 \]

Therefore, the total cost of replacing Mike’s movie collection with digital versions is **$5200**.<|im_end|>","There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series

- Pounds purchased = 6
- Total cost for peaches = $2.00 × 6 = $12.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of plums.
- Price per pound = $1.00
- Pounds purchased = 8
- Total cost for plums = $1.00 × 8 = $8.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of apricots.
- Price per pound = $3.00
- Pounds purchased = 6
- Total cost for apricots = $3.00 × 6 = $18.00

Step 4: Add up all the costs to find the total amount spent on fruit.
Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: driving and hiking.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven.
- Average speed while driving = 50 miles/hour
- Time spent driving = 6 hours

Total distance driven can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{drive}} = 50 \text{ mph} \times 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{drive}} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the average hiking speed.
- Hiking speed is given as \( V_{\text{hike}} \)
- According to the problem, hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
\[ V_{\text{hike}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 - 5 \]
\[ V_{\text{hike}} = 25 - 5 \]
\[ V_{\text{hike}} = 20 \text{ mph} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance hiked.
- Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours

Total distance hiked can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{hike}} = \text{Hiking Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{hike}} = 20 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{hike}} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Sum up both distances to get the total distance.
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{drive}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{hike}} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Ava's Score
- **Points from jumping on enemies**: \(8\) (since she jumped on \(8\) more enemies than Emma)
- **Points from collecting berries**: \(3\) (Emma collected \(3\) berries, so Ava collected \(3 + 2 = 5\) berries)
- **Points from time**: For finishing the level 4 seconds slower, they lose \(4 \times 10 = -40\) points.

So, Ava's total score can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 8 \times 10 + 3 \times 5 - 40 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Emma's Score
- **Points from jumping on enemies**: \(8\) (same as Ava)
- **Points from collecting berries**: \(3\) (same as Ava)
- **Points from time**: Since they finished the level in \(4\) seconds less, they gain \(4 \times 10 = 40\) points.

So, Emma's total score can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 8 \times 10 + 3 \times 5 + 40 \]

### Step 3: Compare Scores
To find out whose score is higher, we need to calculate both scores and compare them.
Let's do this calculation now.

#### Calculating Ava's Score:
\[ \text{Ava's score} = 80 + 15 - 40 = 55 \]

#### Calculating Emma's Score:
\[ \text{Emma's score} = 80 + 15 + 40 = 135 \]

Since \(135 > 55\), Emma has the higher score.

### Conclusion
Emma is better at the new video game! The difference between their scores is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]<|im_end|>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of all pizzas:**
   The total cost for all four pizzas is $64.

2. **Calculate the cost per pizza when two pizzas cost $30 each:**
   Since there are four pizzas in total and we know that two pizzas together cost $30, we can find out what one pizza costs.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost per pizza} = \frac{\$64}{4} = \$16
   \]

   Therefore, each individual pizza costs $16.

3. **Determine the cost of the remaining two pizzas:**
   We already know that two pizzas cost $30 together. So, to find the cost of each of these remaining two pizzas, we divide their combined cost by 2.

   \[
   \text{Cost of each of the remaining two pizzas} = \frac{\$30}{2} = \$15
   \]

So, each of the last two pizzas also costs $15.

   - On regular days (3 days), they ride 3 times.
   - On special days (2 days), they ride 2 times.

2. **Determine the total number of rides over all days:**
   - Regular days: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) rides.
   - Special days: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) rides.

3. **Add the rides from both types of days to get the total weekly rides:**
   - Total rides = Regular days + Special days
   - Total rides = \(9 + 4 = 13\)

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 13 times in a week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Bob initially has 7 fish.
   - Out of these, 3 are orange (and hence 4 are not orange).
   
2. **Adjustment After Purchase:**
   - Bob bought additional fish from the pet store and ended up with 17 total fish.
   - This means he added \(17 - 7 = 10\) new fish.

3. **New Fish Distribution:**
   - Let's denote the number of orange fish after buying as \(x\). So, before buying, there were 3 oranges and \(y\) non-orange fish, making \(x + y = 7\).

4. **After Buying:**
   - The new distribution will be \(x\) orange and \(7-x\) non-orange fish because the total number of fish remains 7 but the composition changes due to the purchase.

5. **Sales Assistant Action:**
   - The sales assistant took out 17 fish from a mixed tank and put them back into the pond.

6. **Equation for Total Fish:**
   - Before adding the new fish, Bob had 7 fish. Adding 17 gives us \(7 + 17 = 24\) fish total.
   - This means the number of orange fish plus the number of non-orange fish equals 24.
   - Since we know that the total number of fish increased, we can deduce that the number of orange fish increases while the number of non-orange fish decreases.

7. **Finding the Number of Orange Fish Bought:**
   - Let's assume the sales assistant removed \(z\) orange fish and \(w\) non-orange fish, where \(z + w = 17\).
   - We also know that after buying, the ratio of orange to non-orange fish should be equal to the initial ratio (since the total number of fish hasn't changed), i.e., \(\frac{x}{7-x} = \frac{3}{4}\).

8. **Solving the Ratio Equation:**
   - From \(\frac{x}{7-x} = \frac{3}{4}\), we can set up an equation:
     \[
     x = \frac{3}{4}(7 - x)
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     4x = 21 - 3x \\
     7x = 21 \\
     x = 3
     \]

9. **Verification:**
   - If \(x = 3\), then the number of non-orange fish would be \(4\), which matches the condition given that there are 3 oranges and 4 non-oranges initially.
   - After buying, the number of orange fish becomes \(3 + z\), and the number of non-orange fish becomes \(4 - z\).
   - The total number of fish must remain 7, so:
     \[
     3 + z + 4 - z = 7
     \]
     Simplifying, we see that our assumption holds true.

Therefore, Bob bought 3 orange fish at the store. The final answer is:
{The final answer is} 3<|im_end|>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

                    question:
                    Andy's car fuel efficiency is 10 MPG (miles ! per gallon). If the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon, how ; much money is Andy's car consuming per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and ! the one-way distance ; between his home and office is 5 miles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much money Andy's car consumes per week, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in a week.
Andy drives from home to work and back five times in a week.

- Distance one way = 5 miles
- Number of trips per day = 2 (Monday to Friday)
- Total number of days per week = 5

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \left(\frac{\text{Distance one way}}{2}\right) \times \text{Number of days per week}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right) \times 5
\]

Calculate:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = 2.5 \times 5 = 12.5 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the weekly fuel consumption.
Given that Andy’s car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, we can calculate the amount of gasoline used per week using the formula:

\[
\text{Fuel consumption} = \frac{\text{Total distance per week}}{\text{Mileage per gallon}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Fuel consumption} = \frac{12.5 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ MPG}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\text{Fuel consumption} = 1.25 \text{ gallons per week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fuel consumed per week.
Given that the price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Cost per week} = \text{Fuel consumption} \times \text{Price per gallon}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Cost per week} = 1.25 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon}
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Cost per week} = 3.75
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Andy's car consumes approximately $3.75 worth of gasoline per week.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $\boxed{3.75}$.<|im_end|>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days

If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

                    question:
                    , Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt ? to use for lunch. : If she ? spent ? all the quarters and 3/5 of : the . twenties, . calculate the ! total amount of . money ! she paid for the . lunch.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the value of the twenties:**
   - Carrie has ten twenties.
   - Each twenty dollar bill equals $20.

   \[
   \text{Total value from twenties} = 10 \times \$20 = \$200
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Carrie has 140 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $\frac{1}{4}$ of a dollar (since there are four quarters in a dollar).

   \[
   \text{Value per quarter} = \$0.25
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total value from quarters} = 140 \times \$0.25 = \$35
   \]

3. **Determine how much Carrie spent on the twenties:**
   - She spent 3/5 of the twenties.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on twenties} = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \times \$200 = \$120
   \]

4. **Calculate how much Carrie spent on the quarters:**
   - She spent 1/5 of the quarters.
   
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on quarters} = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \times \$35 = \$7
   \]

5. **Add up all the expenses to find the total amount spent on lunch:**

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \$120 (\text{twenties}) + \$7 (\text{quarters}) = \$127
   \]

6. **Verify that the remaining amount matches the remaining twenties and quarters:**
   - The remaining twenties would be \(10 - 120\) dollars, but since it's not possible to have negative dollars, let’s re-evaluate our calculations.

Let's correct the approach as follows:

1. **Recalculate the value of the twenties properly:**
   - Since Carrie only spends 3/5 of the twenties, she will spend \( \frac{3}{5} \times \$200 = \$120 \).
   
2. **Calculate the value of the quarters correctly:**
   - Now, calculate how many quarters she can actually afford with the remaining dollars after spending on the twenties. 
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining dollars from twenties} = \$80 (\$200 - \$120)
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of quarters she can buy} = \frac{\text{Remaining dollars}}{0.25}
   \]

Let's proceed further:

1. **Calculate the number of quarters she can buy with the remaining dollars:**
   - After buying the twenties, she has \$80 left.
   - Each quarter costs \$0.25, so she can buy:

\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{\$80}{\$0.25} = 320
\]

Since she cannot buy more than 140 quarters, she buys exactly 140 quarters.

Therefore, she indeed bought all the available quarters without any leftovers.

So, the total amount she spent on lunch is:

\[
\text{Total amount spent on lunch} = \$120 (\text{twenties}) + \$7 (\text{quarters}) = \$127
\]

Hence, the final answer is: 

\[
\boxed{127}
\]<|im_end|>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35

The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

To determine how many fruits Ricardo can harvest from his garden, we need to calculate the total yield for both tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of tomatoes:**
   - Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
   - Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Tomatoes} = \text{Number of Tomato Plants} \times \text{Yield per Plant}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Tomatoes} = 5 \times 22 = 110
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggplants:**
   - Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
   - Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggplants is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Eggplants} = \text{Number of Eggplant Plants} \times \text{Yield per Plant}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Eggplants} = 8 \times 4 = 32
     \]

3. **Sum the total number of fruits:**
   - The total number of fruits (tomatoes + eggplants) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Total Tomatoes} + \text{Total Eggplants}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 110 + 32 = 142
     \]

### Final Answer:
Ricardo can harvest a total of \( \boxed{142} \) fruits from his garden.<|im_end|>","Ricardo can get 22 x 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 tomatoes.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many OLED TVs Samwell was able to sell, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of smart TVs sold**:
   - One-fourth of their sales are smart TVs.
   - Total sales = 40 TVs.

   \[
   \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ TVs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of analog TVs sold**:
   - One-eighth of their sales are analog TVs.
   - Total sales = 40 TVs.

   \[
   \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \text{ TVs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold**:
   - The remaining sales are for OLED TVs.
   - Since the total sales are divided into three categories (smart TVs, analog TVs, and OLED TVs), we subtract the sum of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales.

   \[
   \text{Total sales} - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs}) = \text{Number of OLED TVs}
   \]

   Substituting the values calculated in steps 1 and 2:

   \[
   40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \text{ OLED TVs}
   \]

### Conclusion:
Samwell was able to sell \( \boxed{25} \) OLED TVs.<|im_end|>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.

To determine how much more money John needs, let's break down the information:

1. The total cost of the trip is $300.
2. The school will cover half of this cost.

Step 1: Calculate half of the trip cost.
Half of $300 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, the school will cover $150.

Step 2: Determine how much money John still needs.
John has already raised $50. We need to subtract what the school will pay from his current amount:
\[ 50 - 150 = -100 \]

Since the result is negative, it means John actually has $100 more than needed.

Therefore, the final answer is that John does not need any additional money because he already has enough ($100) to cover the remaining balance of the trip cost.<|im_end|>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much heat Carson needs to prevent the pipes from freezing and then calculate how many logs he needs to burn to achieve that amount of heat.

1. **Determine the total temperature difference:**
   - The pipes will freeze when the indoor temperature falls below 32°F.
   - During the day, the temperature is 45°F.
   - At night, the temperature is 33°F less than during the day, so the nighttime temperature is \(45°F - 33°F = 12°F\).

2. **Calculate the required heating capacity:**
   - To prevent the pipes from freezing, the indoor temperature must be at least 32°F.
   - The maximum allowable temperature difference between the indoors and outdoors for the pipes not to freeze is 12°F (since 45°F - 33°F = 12°F).
   - Therefore, Carson needs to add enough heat to raise the temperature from 45°F to at least 32°F. 
     \[
     \text{Heat needed} = 45°F + x = 32°F \quad \text{(where } x \text{ is the number of degrees needed)}
     \]
     \[
     x = 45°F - 32°F = 13°F
     \]

3. **Determine the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log adds 5°F of heat.
   - To find out how many logs are needed to add 13°F of heat, divide the total heat needed by the heat per log.
     \[
     \text{Number of logs} = \frac{13°F}{5°F/\text{log}} = 2.6 \text{ logs}
     \]
   - Since Carson can't burn a fraction of a log, he needs to round up to the next whole number.
     \[
     \text{Number of logs needed} = 3 \text{ logs}
     \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn **3 logs** to prevent the pipes from freezing.<|im_end|>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees

Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of groups:**
   - We need to form 9-person groups from 90 people.
   - The number of groups can be calculated as \( \frac{90}{9} = 10 \) groups.

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought seashells:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought seashells.
   - Number of groups bringing seashells = \( \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \) groups.

3. **Calculate the number of seashells per group:**
   - Each group has 9 people.
   - Each person in a group brings back 2 seashells.
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells per group is \( 9 \times 2 = 18 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by all groups:**
   - Since there are 6 groups, the total number of seashells is \( 6 \times 18 = 108 \).

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 108 seashells.<|im_end|>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Initial number of passengers**
- The train initially has 172 people.

**Step 2: Determine the number of passengers after the first stop**
- At the first stop, 47 people get off.
- Therefore, the number of people remaining = \( 172 - 47 \).

\[
172 - 47 = 125
\]

So, there are **125 people left on the train after the first stop**.

**Step 3: Add the number of passengers who got on during the first stop**
- During the first stop, 13 more people get on.
- Therefore, the total number of passengers now = \( 125 + 13 \).

\[
125 + 13 = 138
\]

So, there are **138 people on the train after the first stop**.

**Step 4: Determine the number of passengers after the second stop**
- At the second stop, 38 people get off.
- Therefore, the number of people remaining = \( 138 - 38 \).

\[
138 - 38 = 100
\]

So, there are **100 people left on the train after the second stop**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} **100 people** are on the train.<|im_end|>","At the first stop 172 people - 47 people = <<172-47=125>>125 people are on the train.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine Jamie's regular hourly wage:**
   - Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work.
   - Regular hourly wage = $20/hour × 8 hours/day = $160/day.

2. **Calculate the amount Jamie earned on last Tuesday:**
   - Jamie worked 11 hours on last Tuesday.
   - Amount earned = $20/hour × 11 hours = $220.

3. **Calculate the special hourly rate (150% of the regular hourly rate):**
   - Special hourly rate = $20/hour × 150% = $20/hour × 1.5 = $30/hour.

4. **Calculate how many extra hours Jamie worked beyond her usual 8 hours:**
   - Extra hours worked = 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours.

5. **Calculate the total earnings based on the special hourly rate:**
   - Earnings from extra hours at special rate = $30/hour × 3 hours = $90.

6. **Add the earnings from the extra hours to the regular earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular earnings + Extra hours' earnings = $220 + $90 = $310.

Therefore, Jamie was paid a total of $310 for her work that day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of cubs:**
   - The problem states that there are 14 lion cubs.

2. **Determine the number of male lions:**
   - The problem mentions that the number of male lions is ""half as many"" as the number of female lions.
   - Since there are 12 female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{\text{Number of female lions}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of lions (including cubs):**
   - We already know there are 12 female lions, 6 male lions, and 14 lion cubs.
   - Adding these together gives us the total number of lions:
     \[
     \text{Total number of lions} = 12 (\text{female}) + 6 (\text{male}) + 14 (\text{cubs}) = 32
     \]

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Summing up all the individual groups should equal the total number of lions:
     \[
     12 (\text{female}) + 6 (\text{male}) + 14 (\text{cubs}) = 32 (\text{total})
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 32 lions in total in the enclosure.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 32.<|im_end|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 male lions in the enclosure.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The jeans are advertised at 25% off.
   - Original price = $40.

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 40 \times \frac{25}{100} = 40 \times 0.25 = 10

2. **Determine the sale price after applying the discount:**

   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}

Sally starts at $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate. Since Billy's starting rate is $10 per hour,
\[ \text{Sally's Starting Rate} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Sally's total earnings over 20 hours
Since Sally also works 20 hours at her starting rate of $10.50 per hour,
\[ \text{Total Amount Earned by Sally} = 20 \times \$10.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Earned by Sally} = \$210 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the difference in earnings between Billy and Sally
\[ \text{Difference in Earnings} = \text{Total Amount Earned by Billy} - \text{Total Amount Earned by Sally} \]
\[ \text{Difference in Earnings} = \$210 - \$210 \]
\[ \text{Difference in Earnings} = \$0 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$0}
\]<|im_end|>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost compared to 2 bagels, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for 3 loaves of bread.
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves will cost \(3 \times \$2 = \$6\).

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 2 bagels.
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels will cost \(2 \times \$1 = \$2\).

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the two costs.
- The cost of 3 loaves of bread minus the cost of 2 bagels gives us the difference in cost.

Let's perform the calculation:

\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $\$4$ more than 2 bagels.

### Final Answer:

- We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.
- Pierson's score is given as 278.

First, calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Then, add 11 to that amount to find out Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of points scored by both players.
- Pierson's score is 278.
- Nikita's score is 150.

Add their scores together to get the total:
\[ 278 + 150 = 428 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the total number of trees planted at the end of the reforestation campaign, we need to calculate the contributions from both children and teachers separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has an average of 25 students.
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
   \]

2. **Determine how many trees each student plants:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of trees each student plants.
   - Since there are 1000 students, the total number of trees planted by students is \( 1000x \).

3. **Calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers:**
   - There are 3 teachers per class.
   - Each teacher plants 2 trees.
   \[
   \text{Number of teachers} = 3 \times 40 = 120
   \]
   - Total number of trees planted by teachers is \( 120 \times 2 = 240 \).

4. **Sum the contributions from students and teachers:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of trees} = 1000x + 240
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( x \), it can vary based on the specific contribution rule (e.g., if each student contributes one tree). Without this information, we cannot determine a numerical value for the total number of trees. 

However, if we assume that each student contributes exactly one tree, then \( x = 1 \):
\[
\text{Total number of trees} = 1000 \times 1 + 240 = 1240
\]

So, if each student contributes exactly one tree, the total number of trees planted would be 1240.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is: 1240}.<|im_end|>","40 classes participate in the campaign, representing a total of 40 * 25 = <<40*25=1000>>1000 students.

With one tree planted per student, 1000 * 1 = <<1000*1=1000>>1000 trees are planted per student.
With 2 trees planted per teacher, 120 * 2 = <<120*2=240>>240 trees are planted per teacher.
Adding the trees planted by teachers and students, 1000 + 240 = <<1000+240=1240>>1240 trees will have been planted at the end of the campaign.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals currently:**
   - Puppies: 3
   - Koalas: 5
   - Zebras: 2
   - Frogs: 4
   
   Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

2. **Define what ""enough"" means in terms of percentage:**
   We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%.

3. **Determine the total number of stuffed animals after buying more stuffed goats:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats bought.
   
   After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 14 + x
   \]

4. **Set up the equation based on the desired percentage:**
   The percentage of stuffed goats should be 30%, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):
   \[
   x = 0.30 (14 + x)
   \]
   Distribute the 0.30:
   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x
   \]
   Subtract 0.30x from both sides:
   \[
   0.70x = 4.2
   \]
   Divide both sides by 0.70:
   \[
   x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time Kris has already spent on her gaming and then determine how much more she needs to reach 30 hours.

1. **Calculate the time spent in the first two weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour (0.5 hours) every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - She plays for 2 weeks, so that's \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
   - The total time played in the first two weeks is \(14 \times 0.5 = 7\) hours.

2. **Calculate the time spent in the next week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The total time played in the next week is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) hours.

3. **Sum up all the time played so far:**
   - Total time played so far is \(7 + 14 = 21\) hours.

4. **Determine how much more time Kris needs to play:**
   - Kris aims to play a total of 30 hours.
   - Time remaining to be played is \(30 - 21 = 9\) hours.

Therefore, Kris still needs to play for **9 hours** to earn the achievement.<|im_end|>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.

Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the relative speed between the two cars:**
   - Car A (first car) travels at 60 mph.
   - Car B (second car) travels at 70 mph.
   - Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds:
     \[
     \text{Relative Speed} = 60 \text{ mph} + 70 \text{ mph} = 130 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered in 2 hours at the relative speed:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 130 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 260 \text{ miles}

To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade.**

- Third-grade: 
  \[
  \text{Number of third-graders} = 340 \quad \text{(already given)}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Pass rate for third-graders} = \frac{340}{340} = 1 \quad (\text{all passed})

- Fourth-grade:
  \[
  \text{Number of fourth-graders} = 100 \quad \text{(already given)}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips needed for the mosaic:**
   - We know that it takes 12 glass chips per square inch.
   - The height of the mosaic is given as 3 inches.

2. **Convert the area of the mosaic into square inches:**
   - Since the mosaic is described in terms of length rather than width (implied), let's assume it's a rectangle or a square for simplicity.
   - Let \( L \) represent the length of the mosaic in inches. Then the area \( A \) would be \( L \times W = L \times 3 \).

3. **Determine the total number of chips required:**
   - To find out how many chips are needed, multiply the area by the number of chips per square inch.
     \[
     \text{Total Chips} = 12 \times (L \times 3)
     \]
     Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Total Chips} = 36L
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of bags of chips required:**
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.
   - If Milo has two bags, then the total number of chips available is:
     \[
     \text{Total Chips} = 2 \times 72 = 144
     \]

5. **Find out how many inches of the mosaic Milo can make with the available chips:**
   - Divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per bag.
     \[
     \text{Length of Mosaic} = \frac{144}{72} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 2 inches long using the available chips. 

{The final answer is}: 2 inches long.<|im_end|>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much tea was initially available based on the information given about the consumption during the party.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Initial Setup:
Let's denote the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party as \( T \) quarts.

#### Consumption Information:
1. **Four Students** consumed \( 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \) quarts.
2. **Sixteen Students** consumed \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) quarts.

#### Total Consumption:
The total amount of tea consumed during the party is \( 6 + 32 = 38 \) quarts.

#### Remaining Tea:
We know that there are still 10 quarts of tea remaining after the party.

#### Equation for Initial Amount:
Since the initial amount minus the consumption equals the remaining amount, we can write:
\[ T - (38 + 10) = 0 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ T - 48 = 0 \]
\[ T = 48 \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 48 quarts.

#### Conversion to Gallons:
There are 4 quarts in one gallon. Therefore, converting quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of gallons of tea at the beginning of the party was \(\boxed{12}\).<|im_end|>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts
16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts
Students drank 6 + 32 quarts = <<6+32=38>>38 quarts
Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons
The party started with 12 gallons of tea.

2. **Sales Made**: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies.
3. **Remaining To Sell**: After selling 150 candies from his initial order, Dale needs to sell more candies.

Let's calculate how many more candies Dale needs to sell:

- Total number of candies Dale has: Initial order + Additional order = 100 (initial) + 100 (additional) = 200 candies.
- Candies already sold: 150 candies.
- Remaining to sell: Total - Sold = 200 - 150 = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell **50** butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

{The final answer is} 50<|im_end|>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of months in a year**: A standard year has 12 months.

2. **Calculate the number of months from January to May**:
   - January (start): 1 month
   - February: 1 month
   - March: 1 month
   - April: 1 month
   - May: 1 month

3. **Calculate the total number of months from the start to the end of May**:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Determine the doubling pattern**:
   - At the end of each month, the number of students doubles.
   
5. **Calculate the initial number of students at the beginning of the year**:
   - At the beginning of January, there are 10 students.

6. **Calculate the number of students after each month**:
   - After 1 month (end of January):
     \[
     10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ students}
     \]
   - After 2 months (end of February):
     \[

   - After 5 months (end of May):
     \[
     160 \times 2 = 320 \text{ students}

7. **Compare the number of students at the end of May with the initial number of students**:
   - Initial number of students at the beginning of the year: 10
   - Number of students at the end of May: 320
   
8. **Calculate the difference between these two numbers**:
   \[
   320 - 10 = 310

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed per day. We'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Days in the Week
Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of days in the week, let's assume it's a standard 7-day week.

\[ \text{Total days} = 7 \]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost Per Day
Given that Felix made $105 over 7 days, we can calculate his daily earnings:

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \frac{\$105}{7} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$15 \]

### Step 3: Understand the Climbing Cost Per Branch
Felix climbs up a certain number of branches for every $0.25 he earns. This means he incurs a climbing cost of $0.25 for each unit of money earned.

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Branches Climbed Per Dollar Earned
To find out how many branches Felix climbs for each dollar he earns, divide the total cost per branch ($0.25) by his earnings per day ($15):

\[ \text{Branches per dollar} = \frac{\$0.25}{\$15} \]
\[ \text{Branches per dollar} = \frac{1}{60} \]

This fraction represents the proportion of his earnings that go towards climbing branches.

### Step 5: Convert the Fraction to Actual Numbers
We know from Step 4 that Felix climbs approximately \( \frac{1}{60} \) of his earnings per day. To find out how many actual branches he climbs per day, multiply this fraction by his total earnings per day ($15):

\[ \text{Branches per day} = \left(\frac{1}{60}\right) \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{15}{60} \]
\[ \text{Branches per day} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, Felix climbs about **0.25** (or one-fourth) of a branch per day.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.25}

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of petals on all the flowers picked by Rose, subtract the petals dropped, and add the petals blown away.

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the initial count of each type of flower:**
   - Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She then picks 4 more flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - She adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Sum up the total number of petals:**
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Subtract the petals that were dropped:**
   Since she dropped 1 petal from each type, we need to subtract 1 petal from each group.
   - Dropping 1 petal from the first set (3 flowers):
     \[
     15 - 1 = 14 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Dropping 1 petal from the second set (4 flowers):
     \[
     24 - 1 = 23 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Dropping 1 petal from the third set (5 flowers):
     \[
     20 - 1 = 19 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Dropping 1 petal from the fourth set (6 flowers):
     \[
     42 - 1 = 41 \text{ petals}
     \]

4. **Add back the petals blown away:**
   The wind blew away 1 petal from each set. We will add these back once we have calculated the total after dropping.
   - Adding back 1 petal from the first set (3 flowers):
     \[
     14 + 1 = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Adding back 1 petal from the second set (4 flowers):
     \[
     23 + 1 = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Adding back 1 petal from the third set (5 flowers):
     \[
     19 + 1 = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]
   - Adding back 1 petal from the fourth set (6 flowers):
     \[
     41 + 1 = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

5. **Final calculation:**
   Summing up the remaining petals:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is {The final answer is} 101.<|im_end|>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of marshmallows used.
2. Subtract the dropped marshmallows from the total.
3. Divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean.

Let's go through it step by step:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of marshmallows used**

- John makes 9 S'mores.
- DeSean also makes 9 S'mores.
  
Total marshmallows used = Marshmallows per S'more × Number of S'mores made by John + Marshmallows per S'more × Number of S'mores made by DeSean
  
= 1 × (John's 9 S'mores) + 1 × (DeSean's 9 S'mores)
  
= 1 × 9 + 1 × 9
= 9 + 9
= 18 marshmallows

**Step 2: Subtract the dropped marshmallows from the total**

Total marshmallows initially available = 35
Marshmallows dropped = 3

Remaining marshmallows = Total marshmallows - Marshmallows dropped

= 35 - 3
= 32 marshmallows

**Step 3: Divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean**

Number of S'mores each can have = Remaining marshmallows ÷ 2

= 32 ÷ 2
= 16 S'mores

Therefore, after accounting for all the marshmallows used and dropped, both John and DeSean can each have **16 S'mores** with the marshmallows left in the bag.<|im_end|>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

How , much ! money is used?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the total time spent playing.
Jack and his three friends played for a total of 4 hours. Converting this to minutes (since the game duration is given in minutes), we have:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many games each person plays.
Since they all started at the same time and played continuously without breaks, the number of games played will be equal to the total time divided by the length of one game.
\[ \text{Number of games} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per game}} = \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ games} \]

### Step 3: Determine who wins or loses in each game.
- **Jack**: He plays normally for 20 minutes per game.
- **Friend A**: He plays half as long as Jack, so he plays \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes per game.
- **Friend B**: He plays twice as long as Jack, so he plays \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \) minutes per game.
- **Friend C**: He plays more than double as long as Jack, so he plays \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) minutes per game.

### Step 4: Assign roles based on their performance.
We know that Friend C is significantly better than Friend B, and Friend B is significantly worse than Friend A. Let's assign roles accordingly:
- **Friend A**: Plays for 10 minutes.
- **Friend B**: Plays for 40 minutes.
- **Friend C**: Plays for 60 minutes.
- **Jack**: Plays for 20 minutes.

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of games for each person.
Given that each game costs 1 quarter (or $0.25):
- **Jack**: 1 game × $0.25/game = $0.25
- **Friend A**: 1 game × $0.25/game = $0.25
- **Friend B**: 1 game × $0.25/game = $0.25
- **Friend C**: 1 game × $0.25/game = $0.25

### Step 6: Sum up the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$0.25 + \$0.25 + \$0.25 + \$0.25 = \$1.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is $\boxed{1.00}$.<|im_end|>","Jack puts change in 60/20=<<60/20=3>>3 times an hour

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given relationships:**
   - The ratio between salt (S) and citrus zest (Z) is 2:1.
   - The ratio between salt (S) and sugar (U) is 1:1.
   - The ratio between oil (O) and salt (S) is 2:1.
   - The ratio between salt (S) and citrus zest (Z) is 2:1.

2. **Express these ratios in terms of one variable:**
   - Since S = Z/2, we can express the other quantities using S.
   - Let's denote the total weight of the mixture as W (in ounces).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - We know that the total weight of the mixture is the sum of all individual weights, which equals W.
   - Salt + Oil + Fragrance + Citrus zest + Fruity extract + Sugar = W.

4. **Use the ratios to find the weight of each component:**
   - Let's denote the weight of salt as S.
   - Then, the weight of citrus zest would be S/2.
   - The weight of fragrances would be S.
   - The weight of citrus zest would be S/2.
   - The weight of sugar would be S.

5. **Calculate the weight of oil:**
   - From the ratio O:S = 2:1, we can deduce that for every 2 parts of salt, there must be 1 part of oil.
   - Therefore, if S represents the weight of salt, then O would represent 1/2 of the total weight because the ratio implies that the weight of oil is half the weight of salt.

6. **Final calculation:**
   - Since the total weight of the mixture is W, and considering the ratios, we can conclude that the weight of oil is W/2.

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil used is half the total weight of the mixture. 

**The final answer is:**

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the goats:**
   - John bought 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - Total cost for goats = Number of goats × Cost per goat
     \[
     \text{Total cost for goats} = 3 \times \$500 = \$1500
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the cows:**
   - John bought 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - Total cost for cows = Number of cows × Cost per cow
     \[
     \text{Total cost for cows} = 2 \times \$1500 = \$3000
     \]

3. **Sum the costs:**
   - Total amount spent on goats + Total amount spent on cows
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \$1500 + \$3000 = \$4500
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$4500}
\]<|im_end|>","The goats cost 3*500=$<<3*500=1500>>1500

To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has:**
   - Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes.
   - Paul also has 40 toffee cupcakes.

2. **Sum up all the cupcakes:**
   \[

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Joe's initial number of cars:**
   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his total cars.
   - The number of cars Joe sells is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \).

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives away:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Subtract the number of cars Joe sells from his initial amount:**
   - Joe starts with 40 cars.
   - After selling 8 cars, Joe has \( 40 - 8 = 32 \) cars left.

5. **Subtract the number of cars Joe gives away from his remaining amount:**
   - Joe gives away 16 cars.
   - After giving away 16 cars, Joe has \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) cars left.

Therefore, the final number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is \(\boxed{16}\).<|im_end|>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total amount raised by students.
- The total amount raised by all students is $175,000.
- Out of these, $50,000 came from organizations.
- Therefore, the remaining amount must have come from the students.

\[ \text{Amount from students} = \$175,000 - \$50,000 = \$125,000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students.
- There are twenty students in total.

### Step 3: Calculate how much each student raised.
- To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

\[ \text{Amount per student} = \frac{\$125,000}{20} \]

### Step 4: Perform the division.
- Divide \$125,000 by 20:

\[ \text{Amount per student} = \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the walking distance for the first day:**
   - Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores in 8 hours.

2. **Determine the walking distance for the second day:**
   - On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as she did on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours walked on the second day = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

3. **Convert the walking distances into miles (assuming the same distance between all points):**
   - Let's assume the distance between any two points is 1 mile for simplicity.

4. **Calculate the total time taken over both days in hours:**
   - Time taken on the first day = 8 hours.
   - Time taken on the second day = 4 hours.
   - Total time = \( 8 + 4 = 12 \) hours.

5. **Convert the total time into minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total time in hours by 60.
   - Total time in minutes = \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \) minutes.

**Final Answer:** The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is **720 minutes**.<|im_end|>","If she walked half as many hours on the second day as the first day, she walked for 1/2*8 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 hours on the second day.

   - Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.

2. **Counting During the First Break:**
   - During the first break, he counted 20 more cars.
   - Therefore, the total count after the first break = Initial count + Additional cars

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one day.
John does 30 cycles per day.

Each cycle consists of 5 different tasks.

Therefore, the total number of tasks John completes in one day is:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

### Step 2: Determine how much John makes from one task.
Each task pays $1.20.

Therefore, the amount John earns from one task is:
\[ \$1.20 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for one full week (7 days).
Since John works 150 tasks per day, we need to find out how many days he works in a week.

He works \( 150 \) tasks per day for \( 7 \) days.

Thus, his total earnings for the week are:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \times \$1.20/\text{task} \]

Now, calculate the total earnings:
\[ 150 \times 7 \times 1.20 \]

First, multiply 150 by 7:
\[ 150 \times 7 = 1050 \]

Then, multiply the result by $1.20:
\[ 1050 \times 1.20 = 1260 \]

So, John makes:
\[ \$1260 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Magic Cards Becca has. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( B \) represent the number of Magic Cards Becca has.
- Smendrick has \( S \) Magic Cards.
- PJ has \( P \) Magic Cards.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know:
1. The total number of cards is 341.
\[ B + S + P = 341 \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
\[ B = S + 12 \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ.
\[ S = 3P \]

### Step 3: Substitute Equations into Total Equation
First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Next, substitute both \( S = 3P \) and \( B = 3P + 12 \) into the total equation:
\[ (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341 \]
Simplify:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( P \)
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]
Divide by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

### Step 5: Find \( S \) and \( B \)
Now that we have \( P = 47 \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):
\[ S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]
\[ B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

                    question:
                    On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as ; many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each color egg Cindy has and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the number of green eggs:**
   Cindy has 5 green eggs.
   
2. **Calculate the number of blue eggs:**
   Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green ones.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue eggs} = 2 \times (\text{Number of green eggs}) = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   
3. **Determine the number of pink eggs:**
   Cindy has one fewer pink eggs than blue ones.
   \[
   \text{Number of pink eggs} = \text{Number of blue eggs} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]
   
4. **Find the number of yellow eggs:**
   Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink ones.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow eggs} = \frac{\text{Number of pink eggs}}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]
   
5. **Sum the total number of eggs:**
   Now, add all the eggs together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of eggs} = (\text{Green eggs}) + (\text{Blue eggs}) + (\text{Pink eggs}) + (\text{Yellow eggs})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Cindy had a total of 27 eggs altogether.<|im_end|>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.
She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.
And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.
Added all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.

                    Milly needs to return a book she decided was really boring. : The book weighs 4 pounds, cost $32, and needs to ; be returned ; to : a distribution center 20 miles away.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost for shipping the book and then apply the refund rate from Amazon.

### Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost
- **Weight of the book**: 4 pounds
- **Shipping charge per pound**: $0.35
- **Number of miles to the distribution center**: 20 miles
- **Miles per pound**: 20 / 4 = 5 miles per pound

Total miles to ship the book = (weight in pounds) * (miles per pound)
= 4 * 5
= 20 miles

Shipping charge = (weight in pounds) * (shipping charge per pound + miles per pound)
= 4 * ($0.35 + 5)
= 4 * $5.35
= $21.40

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost before refund
Total cost before refund = Shipping charge + Purchase price
= $21.40 + $32
= $53.40

### Step 3: Apply the Amazon refund rate
Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price.
Refunded amount = Total purchase price * Refund rate
= $32 * 0.75
= $24.00

Final refund after applying Amazon’s policy = Original purchase price - Refunded amount
= $32 - $24
= $8

### Step 4: Determine the net loss
Net loss = Total cost before refund - Final refund
= $53.40 - $8
= $45.40

Therefore, Milly will lose $45.40. 

{The final answer is} $45.40<|im_end|>","Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60
Milly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Mulan had initially**

- Mulan starts with $40.
- Her father gives her $100.

Total initial amount = Initial amount + Father's gift
= $40 + $100
= $140

**Step 2: Determine the cost of the items Mulan bought**

- Two pairs of jeans at $30 each.
- A bag for $20.

Cost of two pairs of jeans = Number of jeans × Price per pair
= 2 × $30
= $60

Cost of the bag = $20

**Step 3: Calculate the total expenditure**

Total expenditure = Cost of jeans + Cost of bag
= $60 + $20
= $80

**Step 4: Subtract the total expenditure from the total initial amount**

Money left = Total initial amount - Total expenditure
= $140 - $80
= $60

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left after buying the items.

{The final answer is} $60.<|im_end|>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.
Two pairs of jeans cost 2 x $30 = $<<2*30=60>>60.
Thus, Mulan spends a total of $60 + $20 = $<<60+20=80>>80.
Therefore, Mulan has $140 - $80 = $<<140-80=60>>60 left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in each of the four weeks.

1. **First Week**: According to the information provided, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
   
2. **Second Week**: The problem states that the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Second Week} = \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week**: The problem indicates that the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Third Week} = 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Now, let's find out how much Boris produces in the fourth week:

4. **Fourth Week**: The total production for all four weeks should equal 50,000 bars (as stated at the beginning). We already know the totals for the first three weeks, so we can set up an equation to find the amount produced in the fourth week \( x \):
   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 + x = 50,000
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives us:
   \[
   36,000 + x = 50,000
   \]
   Solving for \( x \) yields:
   \[
   x = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000
   \]

Therefore, the number of bars of chocolate produced in the fourth week is \( 14,000 \).

Ending note: {The final answer is} 14,000 bars.<|im_end|>","In the second week, Boris produces 8,000/2 = <<8000/2=4000>>4,000 bars of chocolate.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the total time spent on TikTok.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of TikToks Britany makes per week.
Britany records 18 TikToks per week.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok per week.
- Time spent on TikTok (writing songs) = 0.2 hours/week × 7 days/week = 1.4 hours/week.
- Time spent on TikTok (applying makeup) = 15 minutes/day × 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week = 1.5 hours/week.
- Total time spent on TikTok per week = 1.4 hours + 1.5 hours = 2.9 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok per month.
There are 4 weeks/month, so the total time spent on TikTok per month = 2.9 hours/week × 4 weeks/month = 11.6 hours/month.

Therefore, Britany spends **11.6 hours** on TikTok in a month.<|im_end|>","First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes

Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the base cost of installing all the items.
- The base cost for installation is $129.00.
- This includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

### Step 2: Determine how many additional items Angela needs to be installed/hung.
- Angela needs to install 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures in total.
- From the base list, we know these items already include:
  - 4 mirrors (included)
  - 2 chandeliers (already included)
  - 10 pictures (already included)

So, let's calculate what else she needs:
- She needs **3 more mirrors** (since she only needs 6 total).
- She also needs **2 more chandeliers** (since she needs 2 chandeliers total).
- For the pictures, since she needs 20 total, but only 10 are already included, she needs **10 more pictures**.

### Step 3: Calculate the additional costs based on the number of items needed.
- For each additional mirror, the cost is $15.00.
- For each additional chandelier, the cost is $15.00.
- For each additional picture, the cost is $15.00.

Now let's compute the additional costs:

#### Mirrors:
- Number of additional mirrors = 3
- Cost per additional mirror = $15.00
- Total cost for mirrors = 3 × $15.00 = $45.00

#### Chandeliers:
- Number of additional chandeliers = 2
- Cost per additional chandelier = $15.00
- Total cost for chandeliers = 2 × $15.00 = $30.00

#### Pictures:
- Number of additional pictures = 10
- Cost per additional picture = $15.00
- Total cost for pictures = 10 × $15.00 = $150.00

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs.
- Base cost = $129.00
- Additional costs for mirrors = $45.00
- Additional costs for chandeliers = $30.00
- Additional costs for pictures = $150.00

Total cost = Base cost + Additional costs for mirrors + Additional costs for chandeliers + Additional costs for pictures
= $129.00 + $45.00 + $30.00 + $150.00
= $354.00

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much more Roy saves compared to Anthony**

- We know that Anthony has saved $10.00.
- Roy saves 40% more than Anthony.

Let \( A \) represent the amount Anthony saved. So, we can write:
\[ A = \$10.00 \]

Roy saves 40% more than Anthony. This means:
\[ R = A + 0.4A \]
\[ R = A(1 + 0.4) \]
\[ R = A(1.4) \]

Substituting the value of \( A \):
\[ R = 10.00 \times 1.4 \]
\[ R = 14.00 \]

So, Roy saves $14.00.

**Step 2: Calculate how much more Roy saves compared to Eva**

- Eva has saved $20.00.
- Roy saves $14.00 more than Anthony.

We already calculated that Anthony saves $10.00. Now, we need to find out how much more Roy saves compared to Anthony.

First, calculate the difference between what Roy saves and what Anthony saves:
\[ D_R = R - A \]
\[ D_R = 14.00 - 10.00 \]
\[ D_R = 4.00 \]

Now, compare this difference to what Eva saved:
\[ E = \$20.00 \]

So, Roy saves $4.00 more than Anthony, who in turn saves $10.00 more than Eva.

**Step 3: Find out how much money Roy has**

Since Roy saves $14.00, and he saves $4.00 more than Anthony, who in turn saves $10.00 more than Eva, we can conclude that:

\[ \text{Money Roy has} = 14.00 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami can.  But Kagiyami can ! lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can.  And Saskay can lift a mountain ; 12 times higher than Pompei : can.  If Pompei can ! lift a mountain 1 inch, how high can Naruto lift a mountain, in feet?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to establish the lifting capabilities of each character based on their relative heights.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define the relationship between the characters' abilities.
- **Naruto**: Can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami.
- **Kagiyami**: Can lift a mountain four times higher than Saskay.
- **Saskay**: Can lift a mountain twelve times higher than Pompei.

### Step 2: Express the relationships as multiplication factors.
- Let \( P \) represent the height that Pompei can lift a mountain (given as 1 inch).
- Therefore, \( S = 12P \) because Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
- Thus, \( K = 4S \) because Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
- Finally, \( N = 10K \) because Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.

### Step 3: Calculate the total factor for Naruto’s ability.
From the above relationships:
\[ N = 10K \]
\[ K = 4S \]
\[ S = 12P \]

Substituting these into \( N \):
\[ N = 10(4S) \]
\[ N = 40S \]

Next, substituting \( S \) from the relationship \( S = 12P \):
\[ N = 40(12P) \]
\[ N = 480P \]

### Step 4: Determine the actual height Naruto can lift.
Since \( P \) represents the height that Pompei can lift a mountain, and given that Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then \( P = 1 \).

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:
\[ N = 480P \]
\[ N = 480 \times 1 \]
\[ N = 480 \text{ inches} \]

### Final Answer:
Naruto can lift a mountain **480 inches** high. To convert this to feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{480}{12} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{40 feet}}
\]<|im_end|>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey:**
   - Mason's speed = 8 miles per hour
   - Time spent traveling the first part = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine how long Mason rests after the first part:**
   - Rest time = Some unknown value (let's call it \( x \) hours)

3. **Calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey:**
   - Time spent traveling the second part = \( 6 - x \) hours (since the total travel time is 10 hours)
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times (6 - x) \, \text{hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 8(6 - x) \, \text{miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 48 - 8x \, \text{miles}
   \]

4. **Add the distances from both parts of the journey to find the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + (48 - 8x) \, \text{miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 80 - 8x \, \text{miles}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the speed of one kangaroo
Given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate their combined speed.

- Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo.
- The total distance covered by the kangaroos in 18 hours is the same as the distance they would cover if all three were traveling together.

Since the time taken (T) is equal to the distance (D) divided by the speed (v), we have:
\[ T = \frac{D}{v} \]

For the three kangaroos:
\[ 18 = \frac{D}{v} \]
From this equation, we can express the distance D in terms of v:
\[ D = 18v \]

### Step 2: Calculate the speed of one turtle
Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle (t) is:
\[ t = \frac{v}{2} \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of hours for four turtles to cross the highway
Now, we need to find out how long it will take four turtles to cover the same distance.

- The combined speed of four turtles will be:
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = 4 \times t = 4 \times \left(\frac{v}{2}\right) = 2v \]

Using the formula \( T = \frac{D}{\text{Combined Speed}} \):
\[ T = \frac{D}{2v} \]

Substitute \( D = 18v \) from Step 1:
\[ T = \frac{18v}{2v} \]
Simplify:
\[ T = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

So, it will take four turtles 9 hours to cross the highway.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: **9 hours**.<|im_end|>","If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed, a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, one kangaroo takes 18/3= <<18/3=6>>6 hours to cross the highway.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of clay dishes made by each person:**
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of clay dishes made by Kora.
   - Given that Kora made 20 dishes, we have:
     \[ K = 20 \]

2. **Calculate the number of clay dishes made by Rory based on Kora’s amount:**
   - Rory makes ""20"" more clay dishes than Kora.
   - Since Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made:
     \[ R = K + 20 \]
     Substituting \( K = 20 \):
     \[ R = 20 + 20 = 40 \]

3. **Calculate the number of clay dishes made by Jada based on Rory’s amount:**
   - Jada makes ""twice as many"" clay dishes as Rory.
   - Since Rory made 40 dishes, Jada made:
     \[ J = 2R \]
     Substituting \( R = 40 \):
     \[ J = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

4. **Sum up the total number of clay dishes made by all three individuals:**
   - Total number of clay dishes:
     \[ T = K + R + J \]
     Substituting \( K = 20 \), \( R = 40 \), and \( J = 80 \):
     \[ T = 20 + 40 + 80 \]

To determine how much money Erika currently has in her purse, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Laptop cost**: $600
2. **Trade-in value reduction**: $200
3. **Remaining amount needed**: $50

First, we calculate the total amount available after trading in her old laptop:
\[ \text{Total available} = \$600 - \$200 = \$400 \]

Next, we consider the additional money Erika received from her part-time job:
\[ \text{Part-time job earnings} = \$150 \]

Additionally, Erika's mother gives her:
\[ \text{Mother's contribution} = \$80 \]

Now, we sum up all these amounts to find out how much money Erika has in her purse before buying the laptop:
\[ \text{Total savings} = \$400 + \$150 + \$80 \]
\[ \text{Total savings} = \$630 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate total number of slices from large apples.
Adam has 3 large apples. Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces.

- Number of slices per large apple = 5
- Total number of slices from all large apples = \( 3 \times 5 \)

\[
= 15
\]

### Step 2: Calculate total number of slices from small apples.
Adam also has 5 small apples. Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces.

- Number of slices per small apple = 3
- Total number of slices from all small apples = \( 5 \times 3 \)

\[
= 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total number of slices before eating any.
Total number of slices = Slices from large apples + Slices from small apples

\[
= 15 (from large) + 15 (from small)
\]
\[
= 30
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the number of slices eaten.
Adam ate 15 slices.

- Remaining slices after eating = Total slices - Slices eaten

\[
= 30 - 15
\]
\[
= 15
\]

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk extracted per day:**
   The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk per day from one cow.

2. **Determine the total number of cows required for 25 liters of milk per day:**
   If we want to extract 25 liters of milk per day, we can set up an equation where \( C \) represents the number of cows needed.
   
   \[
   5C = 25
   \]

3. **Solve for \( C \):**
   To find out how many cows are needed, divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   
   \[
   C = \frac{25}{5} = 5
   \]
   
   So, the farmer needs 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

4. **Determine the current number of cows:**
   The farmer currently has 3 cows.

5. **Calculate the additional number of cows needed:**
   Subtract the current number of cows from the number of cows needed to achieve 25 liters of milk per day:
   
   \[
   \text{Additional cows needed} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the farmer needs **2** more cows to be able to produce 25 liters of milk per day.<|im_end|>","He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the remaining lengths of the glue sticks.
- The first glue stick has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left.
- The second glue stick has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left.
- The third glue stick has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left.

### Step 2: Calculate the original length of each glue stick if they were completely full.
Let's denote the original length as \( L \).

For the first glue stick:
\[ L - \frac{1}{6}L = \frac{5}{6}L \]

For the second glue stick:
\[ L - \frac{2}{3}L = \frac{1}{3}L \]

For the third glue stick:
\[ L - \frac{1}{2}L = \frac{1}{2}L \]

### Step 3: Add up the lengths to find the total original length of all the glue sticks combined.
We need to add these fractions together to get the total original length before any was used.

\[
\text{Total original length} = \frac{5}{6}L + \frac{1}{3}L + \frac{1}{2}L
\]

First, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 6, 3, and 2 is 6.

Convert each fraction to have a denominator of 6:

\[
\frac{1}{3}L = \frac{2}{6}L
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}L = \frac{3}{6}L
\]

Now, add them together:

\[
\frac{5}{6}L + \frac{2}{6}L + \frac{3}{6}L = \frac{5 + 2 + 3}{6}L = \frac{10}{6}L = \frac{5}{3}L
\]

So, the total original length of all the glue sticks combined is \( \frac{5}{3}L \).

### Step 4: Find the total unused length of the glue sticks.
Since the total original length is \( \frac{5}{3}L \), and there are three glue sticks, the total unused length would be:

\[
\text{Total unused length} = 3 \times \frac{5}{3}L = 5L
\]

### Step 5: Convert the unused length back to millimeters.
Given that each glue stick is 12 mm long, we can calculate the total unused length in millimeters:

\[
5L \text{ mm} = 5 \times 12 \text{ mm} = 60 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is **60 mm**.<|im_end|>","The first glue stick has 12 x 1/6 = <<12*1/6=2>>2 millimeters left.

- The car costs $10,000.
- The phone costs $800.

Total cost = Car price + Phone price  
            = $10,000 + $800  
            = $10,800  

**Step 2: Determine how much money Gabriel currently has**

Gabriel has:
- $5,000 from working on weekends.
- His brother gave him $200.

Total amount = $5,000 + $200  
              = $5,200  

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount Gabriel currently has**

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many socks Peter has.
2. Determine how many dishes Peter has.
3. Calculate the total number of socks and dishes they both have.

Let's start with the information given about Jack:

- Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
- Jack collected 60 dishes.

Step 1: Calculate how many socks Jack has.
Since Jack collects twice as many dishes as socks, if he collects 60 dishes, then he must collect \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) socks.

Step 2: Calculate how many socks Peter has.
Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.

Step 3: Calculate how many dishes Peter has.
Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack collected 60 dishes, Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now that we know both Peter and Jack have their respective numbers of items (socks and dishes), let's add them up:

- Total number of socks: \( 60 + 30 = 90 \)
- Total number of dishes: \( 30 + 60 = 90 \)

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

So, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.

He also has half times as many dishes as Jack which is 1/2*60 = 30 dishes.
In total, he has 60+30 = <<60+30=90>>90 socks and dishes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many students are good at either math or English.

1. **Identify total number of students**: There are 20 students in total.
   
2. **Determine the number of students who are good at math only**:
   - There are 5 students who are good at math only.

3. **Calculate the number of students who are not good at math only**:
   - Since there are 20 students in total and 5 are good at math only, the remaining \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) students are not good at math only (i.e., they are not good at math).

4. **Identify the number of students who are good at English only**:
   - There are 8 students who perform well in English only.

5. **Calculate the number of students who are not good at English only**:
   - Since there are 20 students in total and 8 are good at English only, the remaining \( 20 - 8 = 12 \) students are not good at English only (i.e., they are not good at English).

6. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who are good at both subjects**:
   - The total number of students who are good at either math or English should be equal to the sum of those who are good at each subject minus those who are counted twice (those who are good at both).
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of students who are good at both subjects.
   - Therefore, \( x = 5 + 8 - 15 \) because 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only, but since they cannot be good at both, their overlap has been subtracted once already.
   - Simplifying, \( x = 13 \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of students who are good at both math and English is \( 13 \).

Thus, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 13.<|im_end|>","The number of students who are good at math includes those who are only good at math and those who are good at both math and English. The only group that isn't included is the students who are only good at English.

To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one performance cycle (including all stages) and then divide the total concert duration by this time.

Step 1: Calculate the total time for one performance cycle.
- Time spent getting on stage = 2 minutes
- Performance time = 6 minutes
- Time spent exiting stage = 2 minutes
- Total time per performance cycle = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Step 2: Include the intermission.
- Intermission time = 10 minutes
- Total time per performance cycle including intermission = 10 + 10 = 20 minutes

Step 3: Determine how many performance cycles fit into the total concert duration.
- Concert duration = 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Number of performance cycles = 120 / 20 = 6 cycles

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform during the concert is 6.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the annual interest rate.
2. Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years.
3. Add the total interest to the initial investment.

**Step 1: Determine the annual interest rate**

Brenda's scheme has an interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year. Since her initial investment was $300, the annual interest rate can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times \$300 \]

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 \]

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = 3 \times 75 \]

\[ \text{Annual Interest Rate} = \$225 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years**

Now, we calculate the total interest earned over 3 years using the annual interest rate:

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Annual Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Years} \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$225 \times 3 \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$675 \]

**Step 3: Add the total interest to the initial investment**

Finally, we add the total interest to the initial investment to find out how much Brenda will have in total after 3 years:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Initial Investment} + \text{Total Interest} \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$300 + \$675 \]

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$975 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is $\$975$.}.<|im_end|>","Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225

<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine how many trays are needed:**
   - The farmer has 900 eggs.
   - Each tray can hold 30 eggs.

   To find out how many trays are required, divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of one tray:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Capacity of one tray}} = \frac{900}{30}
   \]

   Simplify the division:

   \[
   \frac{900}{30} = 30
   \]

   So, the farmer needs 30 trays.

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling all the eggs:**
   - The farmer sells each tray for $2.5.
   - Since there are 30 trays, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5
   \]

   Perform the multiplication:

   \[
   30 \times 2.5 = 75

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many goats were originally on each farm.
- **Farm X**: Initially, there are 55 goats.
- **Farm Y**: Initially, there are 45 goats.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm.
- **From Farm X**:
  - Originally, there were 55 goats.
  - He sold 10 goats.
  
  Therefore, the remaining goats on Farm X = \( 55 - 10 \).

  Remaining goats on Farm X = \( 55 - 10 = 45 \).

- **From Farm Y**:
  - Originally, there were 45 goats.
  - Twice as many goats (since he sold more) were sold from Farm Y compared to Farm X.
  
  Since he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he sold \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) goats from Farm Y.

  Therefore, the remaining goats on Farm Y = \( 45 - 20 \).

  Remaining goats on Farm Y = \( 45 - 20 = 25 \).

### Step 3: Add the remaining goats from both farms together.
- **Total remaining goats** = Goat count on Farm X + Goat count on Farm Y.

  Total remaining goats = \( 45 + 25 \).

  Total remaining goats = \( 70 \).

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The total number of goats left on both farms altogether is 70.<|im_end|>","There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much James pays on average per pair of shoes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of months in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.

2. **Determine the total number of pairs of shoes purchased over a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes purchased in one year is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pairs.

3. **Total amount spent on shoes each year:**
   - The total amount spent on shoes each year is given as $2640.

4. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - To find the average cost per pair of shoes, divide the total amount spent on shoes by the total number of pairs purchased.
   
\[
\text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total number of pairs}}
\]

\[
\text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{2640}{24}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per basket for each type of food.
- The cost of one basket of green food is $25.
- The cost of one basket of red food is $18.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of baskets bought.
We need to buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food (since we're buying them together).

- Total cost for green food = 3 × $25 = $75
- Total cost for red food = 3 × $18 = $54

### Step 3: Add up the total cost before any discounts.
Total cost without discount = Cost of green food + Cost of red food
= $75 + $54
= $129

### Step 4: Apply the discount.
Since there is a discount of $2 per basket on both types of food, we can apply this discount as follows:

- Discount applied to green food = 3 × $2 = $6
- Discount applied to red food = 3 × $2 = $6

### Step 5: Subtract the total discount from the total cost.
Discounted total cost = Original total cost - Total discount
= $129 - ($6 + $6)

                    question:
                    A local town is expanding and wants to build ! several new homes across . the next three , years. In . the first ! year, they will build 12 homes. In : the next , year, they will build three times this ; many homes. In the ? third year, they ? will count how many homes they ; have , built and double the amount. . How ? many homes will the town have built , over , the next . three years?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of homes built in the next three years. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of homes built in the first year.
- The town builds 12 homes in the first year.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of homes built in the second year.
- According to the problem, in the second year, they will build three times as many homes as in the first year.
- Number of homes in the second year = \(3 \times 12\).

\[
3 \times 12 = 36
\]

So, the town builds 36 homes in the second year.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of homes built in the third year.
- After doubling the amount from the second year, the town will build twice the number of homes built in the second year.
- Number of homes in the third year = \(2 \times (3 + 1)\) (where 3 is the number of homes built in the second year).

First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

\[
3 + 1 = 4
\]

Then, multiply by 2:

\[
2 \times 4 = 8
\]

So, the town builds 8 homes in the third year.

### Step 4: Sum up all the homes built over the three years.
- Homes built in the first year: 12
- Homes built in the second year: 36
- Homes built in the third year: 8

Total number of homes built = \(12 + 36 + 8\)

Now, perform the addition:

\[
12 + 36 = 48
\]
\[
48 + 8 = 56
\]

Therefore, the total number of homes built over the next three years is **56**.<|im_end|>","In the second year, they build three times as many homes as the first year which is 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 homes.
So far in the two years, they've built 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 homes
In the third year, they double the number of homes built in the first two years, so 48*2 = <<48*2=96>>96 homes.
Altogether, the local town has built 48+ 96 = <<48+96=144>>144 homes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent your age.

2. **Express Your Brother's Age:**
   Since you are three years younger than your brother, his age would be \( x + 3 \).

3. **Express Your Sister's Age:**
   Since you are two years older than your sister, her age would be \( x - 2 \).

4. **Determine Mom's Age:**
   According to the information provided, your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age. Therefore, if \( B \) represents your brother's age, then \( M = 3B - 1 \). Given that \( B = x + 3 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation for Mom's age:
   \[
   M = 3(x + 3) - 1
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   M = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8
   \]

5. **Set Up the Equation for Total Ages:**
   The total sum of all your ages equals 87:
   \[
   x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   6x + 9 = 87
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   6x = 78
   \]
   Divide by 6:
   \[
   x = 13
   \]

Therefore, you are 13 years old.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 13.<|im_end|>","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed.
2. Determine how many packs of glue sticks are required.
3. Check if there's any leftover glue sticks after purchasing.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed**

Mr. Jackson wants to give each of the 27 students 2 glue sticks each. So, the total number of glue sticks needed is:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many packs of glue sticks are required**

Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks (54) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).

Since we can't buy partial packs, we'll round up to the next whole number because even if we don't use all the packs, we still need one more to cover the remaining students' needs. 

Let's do the division:
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

This means we need 7 packs to ensure that every student gets at least 2 glue sticks. However, since we're rounding up, we need to check if it's possible to get exactly 54 glue sticks using fewer than 7 packs. Let's see if 6 packs would be enough.

If 6 packs are bought, then the number of glue sticks is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks per pack} = 48 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of students who won't receive their full share:
\[ 27 - 6 = 21 \]
So, 21 students won't get their full share of 2 glue sticks.

Therefore, buying 6 packs is not sufficient. Now, let's try 7 packs:

If 7 packs are bought, then the number of glue sticks is:
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks per pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Since 56 glue sticks are available, and 27 students need 2 glue sticks each, the total number of glue sticks distributed will be:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

This means 3 students will have an extra glue stick, but they will still have enough for their full share. Therefore, buying 7 packs is sufficient.

**Conclusion**
Mr. Jackson will need to buy **7 packs** so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]<|im_end|>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Water Volume**: 
   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain** (Second Day):
   - The amount of water doubles after a day of heavy rain.
   - Therefore, the second day's volume = 4000 gallons * 2 = 8000 gallons.

3. **Third Day Increase**:
   - On the third day, the volume increases by 6000 gallons compared to the previous day.
   - Third day's volume = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

Now let's sum up all the volumes for the three days:
- First day: 4000 gallons
- Second day: 8000 gallons
- Third day: 14000 gallons

Total volume over the three days = 4000 gallons + 8000 gallons + 14000 gallons = 26000 gallons.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people get infected over time given that each infected person infects six others every day.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Infection
- On Day 0 (initial infection), there are 10 people infected.
  
### Step 2: Infected People on Each Subsequent Day
Each infected person infects six others per day. Let's calculate the number of new infections for each subsequent day.

#### Day 1:
- Number of new infections = \( 6 \times 10 \) = 60
- Total number of infected people = \( 10 + 60 \) = 70

#### Day 2:
- Number of new infections = \( 6 \times 70 \) = 420
- Total number of infected people = \( 70 + 420 \) = 490

#### Day 3:
- Number of new infections = \( 6 \times 490 \) = 2940
- Total number of infected people = \( 490 + 2940 \) = 3430

### Final Answer:
After three days, the total number of people infected is **3430**.<|im_end|>","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.

On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.

   \]

2. **Determine how much Julieta received:**
   - Julieta received 10% less than what Rafaela received.
   - To find 10% of Rafaela’s tips:
     \[
     \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = \$80
     \]
   - Subtract this from Rafaela's total tips:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber over a one-year period.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of badges Claire earns per month.
Claire earns 1 badge every month.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of badges Amber earns per month.
Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, she would earn half the number of badges Claire does in the same time frame.

- **Amber’s monthly badges** = \( \frac{1}{2} \) (since she takes twice as long)

### Step 3: Calculate the number of badges Wendy earns per month.
Wendy earns three times the number of badges Claire does in the same time frame.

- **Wendy’s monthly badges** = \( 3 \times 1 \) = 3 (since she earns three times as much as Claire)

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of badges each person earns in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.

- **Total badges for Claire** in a year = \( 12 \times 1 \) = 12 (since Claire earns 1 badge per month)
  
- **Total badges for Amber** in a year = \( 12 \times \frac{1}{2} \) = 6 (since Amber earns half the number of badges Claire does per month)
  
- **Total badges for Wendy** in a year = \( 12 \times 3 \) = 36 (since Wendy earns three times the number of badges Claire does per month)

### Step 5: Compare the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber.
- **Difference in badges** between Wendy and Amber = \( 36 - 6 \) = 30

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame.

2. Determine the total number of slices.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the slices.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Banana Bread Loaves Baked
Paige bakes 2 banana bread loaves every hour. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, there are 5 hours.

\[
\text{Total loaves} = \text{Loaves per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Loaves} \times \text{Slices per loaf}
\]

\[
\text{Total slices} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Revenue
Each slice is sold for $0.50.

\[
\text{Total revenue (in dollars)} = \text{Total slices} \times \text{Price per slice}
\]

\[
\text{Total revenue (in dollars)} = 80 \times 0.50 = 40 \text{ dollars}

2. **Set up an equation based on the relationship between gold and silver coins:**
   Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can write:
   \[
   G = S + 30
   \]
   We know that \( G = 70 \), so substitute 70 for G:
   \[
   70 = S + 30
   \]

3. **Solve for the number of silver coins (S):**
   Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate S:
   \[
   70 - 30 = S
   \]
   \[
   S = 40
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of coins (Gold + Silver):**
   Now that we know there are 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins, we can add them together:
   \[
   Total = G + S = 70 + 40
   \]
   \[
   Total = 110
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos distributed:**
   - Each student received 10 burritos.
   - There are 50 students.

   \[
   \text{Total burritos per student} = 10 \times 50 = 500 \text{ burritos}

2. **Account for the burritos eaten by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

3. **Subtract the eaten burritos from the total distributed:**

   \[
   \text{Burritos left after Mr. George eats} = 500 - 20 = 480 \text{ burritos}
   \]

4. **Determine if any burritos are left over:**
   - The original order quantity was 600 burritos.
   - After distributing burritos to all students and accounting for Mr. George's consumption, we have:

     \[
     \text{Remaining burritos} = 600 - 480 = 120 \text{ burritos}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cars.
- We know there are 12 red cars.
- There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars.

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 10 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of blue cars.
- There are 3 times the number of green cars as blue cars.

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times (\text{Number of green cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars.
- Red cars: 12
- Green cars: 10
- Blue cars: 30

Total number of these three types of cars:
\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 + 10 + 30 \]
\[ \text{Total of red, green, and blue cars} = 52 \]

### Step 4: Subtract from the total number of cars to find the number of yellow cars.
- Total number of cars in the rink: 75

So, the number of yellow cars:
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 23 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's define variables for the number of books each person has:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem statement, we can write the following equations based on the given information:

1. The total number of books is 85:
\[ S + A + F = 85 \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
\[ S = A + 25 \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Now, let's substitute these expressions into the first equation to find \( F \):

Substitute \( S \) from Equation (2) into Equation (1):
\[ (A + 25) + A + F = 85 \]
Simplify:
\[ 2A + 25 + F = 85 \]
Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, substitute \( A \) from Equation (3) into the simplified equation:
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
Distribute and simplify:
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
Add 24 to both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

So, Fawn has 28 books.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the weight of the bag of carrots.
2. Calculate how many pounds of carrots Daisy bought.

Let's start with the first step:

### Step 1: Determine the weight of the bag of carrots
- The bag of sweet potatoes weighs 2 times as much as the bag of potatoes.
- The bag of potatoes weighs 5 pounds.

First, calculate the weight of the bag of sweet potatoes:
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} \]
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, determine the weight of the bag of carrots:
- The bag of carrots weighs 3 pounds less than the bag of sweet potatoes.
- Therefore, the weight of the bag of carrots is:
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 \]
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Weight of carrots} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought
Since Daisy only bought one bag of carrots, she bought 7 pounds of carrots.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of jello cups needed.
Greg wants to provide 4 jello cups per child and there will be 30 children at the party.

\[
\text{Total jello cups needed} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Jelly cups per child}
\]

Substitute the given numbers into the equation:

\[
\text{Total jello cups needed} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

So, Greg needs a total of 120 jello cups.

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are required.
Each box contains 10 jello cups.

\[
\text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total jello cups needed}}{\text{Jelly cups per box}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{120}{10} = 12
\]

Therefore, Greg needs 12 boxes of jello.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the jello boxes.
Each box costs $1.25.

\[
\text{Cost of one box} = \$1.25
\]

Since Greg needs 12 boxes:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 1.25 = \$15
\]

### Conclusion:
Greg will spend a total of $15 on jello.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per bottle for both soda and water first. Then, we can calculate the total cost based on the number of bottles David wants to purchase.

Step 1: Determine the price per bottle of soda.
- We know that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the price per bottle of soda = Total cost / Number of bottles = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle.

Step 2: Determine the price per bottle of water.
- We know that four bottles of water cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the price per bottle of water = Total cost / Number of bottles = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for three bottles of soda.
- Price per bottle of soda = $3.00
- Number of bottles of soda = 3
- Total cost for three bottles of soda = Price per bottle * Number of bottles = $3.00 * 3 = $9.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for two bottles of water.
- Price per bottle of water = $2.00
- Number of bottles of water = 2
- Total cost for two bottles of water = Price per bottle * Number of bottles = $2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Step 5: Add the costs together to get the total amount David needs to pay.
- Cost for soda = $9.00
- Cost for water = $4.00
- Total cost = Cost for soda + Cost for water = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00

Therefore, if David wants to buy three bottles of soda and two bottles of water, he will need to pay $13.00. The final answer is:

- David initially has $12.48.
- We subtract the total cost of the bolts ($0.48) from his initial amount.

Remaining money = Initial amount - Total cost
                = $12.48 - $0.48
                = $12.00

**Final Answer:**
David will have **$12.00** left after buying the bolts.<|im_end|>","David paid 16 * 0.03 = $<<16*0.03=0.48>>0.48 for the bolts.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the hourly wage Ella earns from dog-walking and then use that information to calculate her earnings over a different time period.

**Step 1: Determine Ella's hourly wage**

Ella worked for 3 hours and earned $33.
- To find out how much she earns per hour, divide the total amount earned by the number of hours worked:

\[ \text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} \]

\[
= \$11 \text{ per hour}
\]

So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for 12 hours**

Now that we know Ella's hourly wage, we can calculate how much she would earn if she works for an additional 9 hours (since 12 - 3 = 9).

- Multiply the hourly wage by the new number of hours:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$11 \times 9 \text{ hours} \]

\[
= \$99
\]

Therefore, Ella would earn **$99** after working for another 12 hours.<|im_end|>","Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.
So for 12 hours of dog walking, Ella would earn $11 x 12 = $<<12*11=132>>132.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul had after receiving more from his friend.**

Paul initially had 52 marbles. He received an additional 28 marbles from his friend.

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 52 + 28 \]

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 80 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many marbles Paul lost.**

He lost \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his total marbles.

\[ \text{Marbles lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \]

\[ \text{Marbles lost} = 20 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the lost marbles from the total number of marbles to find out how many marbles Paul has left.**

\[ \text{Marbles left} = 80 - 20 \]

\[ \text{Marbles left} = 60 \]

Therefore, Paul has **60** marbles left.<|im_end|>","Paul has a total of 52 + 28 = <<52+28=80>>80 marbles.

To determine how many points Amy scores, we need to calculate the total number of correct answers for each type of question and then multiply these by their respective point values.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of correct answers for each type of question.
- **Multiple-choice questions**:
  - Amy correctly answers \(80\%\) of the 10 multiple-choice questions.
  \[
  \text{Number of correct multiple-choice questions} = 0.80 \times 10 = 8
  \]

- **True/false questions**:
  - Amy correctly answers \(90\%\) of the 20 true/false questions.
  \[
  \text{Number of correct true/false questions} = 0.90 \times 20 = 18
  \]

- **Long-answer questions**:
  - Amy correctly answers \(60\%\) of the 5 long-answer questions.
  \[
  \text{Number of correct long-answer questions} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of correct answers.
Sum up all the correct answers from each type of question.
\[
\text{Total number of correct answers} = 8 + 18 + 3 = 29
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total points based on the given point values.
- Each multiple-choice or true/false question is worth 1 point.
- Each long-answer question is worth 5 points.

Calculate the points for each type of question:
- Points from multiple-choice questions: \(8 \times 1 = 8\)
- Points from true/false questions: \(18 \times 1 = 18\)
- Points from long-answer questions: \(3 \times 5 = 15\)

Finally, sum these points to get the total score.
\[
\text{Total score} = (8 + 18 + 15) = 41
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{41}\).<|im_end|>","First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions
Then find the number of true/false questions she gets right: 90% * 20 questions = <<90*.01*20=18>>18 questions
Now add those two numbers to find the number of 1-point questions she answered correctly: 8 questions + 18 questions = <<8+18=26>>26 questions. This is also the number of points she got, since each question is worth 1 point.
Now find the number of 5-point questions Amy answered correctly: 5 questions * 60% = <<5*60*.01=3>>3 questions
Now multiply that number by the number of points per question: 3 questions * 5 points/question = <<3*5=15>>15 points

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias will sell:**
   - Isaias plans to sell \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his chickens.
   - He has 300 chickens in total.
   - Therefore, the number of chickens he will sell is \(300 \times \frac{3}{5} = 180\).

2. **Determine the revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $50.
   - So, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is \(180 \times 50 = \$9000\).

3. **Calculate the amount of money Isaias needs to cover his costs to achieve a profit of $2000:**
   - The total revenue must be enough to cover the cost plus the desired profit.
   - Let's denote the total cost as \(C\).
   - We know that the total revenue should equal the total cost plus the profit ($2000).
   - Therefore, \(C + 2000 = 9000\), which simplifies to \(C = 7000\).

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Since the total revenue is $9000 and the total cost is $7000, the total cost \(C\) is $7000.

5. **Determine the total amount of money Isaias spent on buying the chickens:**
   - We know the total cost \(C\) is $7000.
   - Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000.

So, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for $7000. 

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is $7000}.<|im_end|>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many glasses Micah sold**
- We know that Julie sold 14 glasses.
- The total number of glasses sold by all three friends is 32.

Let \( x \) represent the number of glasses sold by each of Micah and Mitchell.

Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we can write:
\[ 14 + x + x = 32 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah also sold **9 glasses**.

**Step 2: Calculate how many more glasses Julie sold compared to Micah**
- Julie sold 14 glasses.
- Micah sold 9 glasses.

Calculate the difference:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold **5 more glasses** than Micah.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** 
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Iris spends on a pedicure based on the information provided about her spending for other services.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the cost of a manicure:**
   - Iris spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much on a manicure as she does on her hair.
   - The cost of her hair = $400.
   - Therefore, the cost of her manicure = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \).

2. **Calculate the cost of a pedicure:**
   - Iris spends \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much on a pedicure as she does on her manicure.
   - The cost of her manicure = $100.
   - Therefore, the cost of her pedicure = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \).

Now, let's summarize what we have calculated so far:
- Iris spends $400 on her hair.
- She spends $100 on her manicure.
- She spends $75 on her pedicure.

Next, we add up all these costs to find out how much money she spent in total at the spa:

\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 675 \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:

\[

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah's friend wants to buy:**
   - The length of the rope her friend wants to buy is not specified in the problem.
   - Let's assume her friend wants to buy a rope that is 30 meters long (since it's common practice to round up when buying multiple items).

2. **Determine how many meters of rope Sarah can cut from her original rope:**
   - Sarah has a 20-meter rope.
   - If her friend wants to buy a rope that is 30 meters long, she cannot get enough rope from her existing 20-meter rope because 30 meters exceeds her available length.

Since Sarah doesn't have enough rope to fulfill her friend's request, let's re-evaluate if there was an error or misunderstanding. However, based on the given information and assuming no errors, Sarah would indeed be unable to provide the requested amount of rope.

Given this, let's proceed to calculate how much money Sarah makes from selling the remaining rope at $2 per meter.

3. **Assume Sarah cuts the maximum possible length of rope from her 20-meter rope:**
   - Since her friend only wants 30 meters but she can only give her 20 meters, she would effectively ""cut"" out 10 meters worth of rope.

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the remaining rope:**
   - The price per meter of the remaining rope is $2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 meters of rope is \(10 \times \$2 = \$20\).

5. **Subtract the cost of the new rope from Sarah's initial savings:**
   - The cost of the new rope is not mentioned, so we'll consider the same price as before, which is $1.5 per meter.
   - Assuming she bought a new rope at $1.5 per meter, she would spend \(10 \times \$1.5 = \$15\) on the new rope.

6. **Final calculation:**
   - Sarah's initial savings were $20.
   - She spent $15 on the new rope.
   - Thus, the leftover money after buying the new rope is \(\$20 - \$15 = \$5\).

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} \$5.<|im_end|>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40

   - In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
   - Therefore, in 10 years from now, she is currently \(18 - 10 = 8\) years old.

2. **Set up an equation to find when her age will be three times what it is now:**
   - Let \(x\) represent the number of years after the current time that we're looking for.
   - Her age in \(x\) years from now will be \(18 + x\).
   - According to the problem, at that time, her age should be three times her current age, which is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

3. **Formulate the equation based on the given conditions:**
   \[
   18 + x = 3(18)

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Kelly has left after purchasing the items from her list.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the bacon
- Each pack of bacon costs $2.
- Kelly buys 5 packs of bacon.
- Total cost of bacon = 5 * $2 = $10.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chicken
- The cost of one pack of chicken is twice that of bacon, so it's $4.
- Kelly buys 6 packs of chicken.
- Total cost of chicken = 6 * $4 = $24.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the strawberries
- Each pack of strawberries costs $4.
- Kelly buys 3 packs of strawberries.
- Total cost of strawberries = 3 * $4 = $12.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the apples
- Each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, so it's $2.
- Kelly buys 7 packs of apples.
- Total cost of apples = 7 * $2 = $14.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all items
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14
- Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

### Step 6: Determine how much money Kelly has left
- Kelly's budget is $65.
- Money left = $65 - $60 = $5.

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \boxed{5}.<|im_end|>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.

The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.

                    question:
                    Elaina ; is : holding the final concert . in her tour. ! To ! celebrate her final concert, she ! makes the concert twice as long as ? her usual concerts. At ! the end of the . concert, she ? also performs a 15-minute , encore. If the runtime of this final concert . is 65 minutes then ; how . long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of Elaina's usual concert based on the information provided about the final concert.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total time spent at the concert:**
   - The final concert runs for 65 minutes.
   - It includes an encore performance that lasts 15 minutes.
   
2. **Calculate the time spent performing without the encore:**
   - Subtract the duration of the encore from the total concert time.
     \[
     65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   So, Elaina spends 50 minutes performing during the final concert.

3. **Relate the final concert's length to her usual concerts:**
   - We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
   - Let \( x \) represent the length of one of her usual concerts (in minutes).

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - Since the final concert is twice the length of one usual concert,
     \[
     2x = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to find the length of one usual concert.
     \[
     x = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Elaina’s usual concerts last for **25 minutes**.<|im_end|>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.
This is twice as long as her usual concerts so her usual concert must have a runtime of 50 minutes / 2 = <<50/2=25>>25 minutes.

   - To Bonnie: \( 80 \) toys
   - To Nicky: \( 30 \) toys

3. **Add up all the toys given away:**
   \[
   40 + 80 + 30 = 150
   \]

4. **Subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:**
   \[
   200 - 150 = 50

To determine the total number of chimichangas made over the three specified days (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Wednesday**

According to the information provided:
- On Wednesday, the shop makes 125 chimichangas.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Friday**

It's stated that the shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Friday compared to Wednesday.
- Number of chimichangas on Friday = \( 2 \times \text{Number of chimichangas on Wednesday} \)

Given that the number of chimichangas on Wednesday is 125:
\[ \text{Number of chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times 125 = 250 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday**

The shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday.

**Step 4: Sum up the total number of chimichangas made on all three days**

We now have the number of chimichangas for each day:
- Monday: 125
- Tuesday: 125

   - The total number of microphones is 50.
   - 20% of the microphones will not fit into pairs.

2. **Determine how many microphones will fit into pairs:**
   - First, calculate 20% of 50 microphones.

To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to break down the information given and sum up all the birds.

1. **Number of birds nesting**:
   Jerry counts 6 birds nesting.

2. **Number of birds flying overhead**:
   The problem states that Jerry sees \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the birds nesting. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
   \]

3. **Number of birds feeding**:
   Jerry also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

4. **Total number of birds counted**:
   We add up all these numbers to get the total:
   \[
   \text{Total number of birds} = \text{Birds nesting} + \text{Birds flying overhead} + \text{Birds feeding}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:

To determine what percentage of the plants are flowering plants, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of plants**: Mrs. Smith has 100 plants.
2. **Number of indoor plants**: Since one-fourth of the total plants are indoor plants, we calculate this as \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \) indoor plants.
3. **Remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants**: Subtracting the number of indoor plants from the total gives us \( 100 - 25 = 75 \) remaining plants.

Now, out of these remaining plants (75), two-thirds are outdoor plants, so we calculate this as \( \frac{2}{3} \times 75 \).

4. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants**:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \text{ outdoor plants}
   \]

Finally, to find the number of flowering plants, we subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants:
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25 \text{ flowering plants}
   \]

Next, we need to convert the number of flowering plants into a percentage of the total number of plants. We do this by dividing the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiplying by 100:
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 25%.<|im_end|>","There are 100 x 1/4 = <<100*1/4=25>>25 indoor plants.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rotations per second the whirligig makes based on its relationship to the thingamabob. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between the speeds
We know that the whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. This means if the thingamabob rotates once in \( t \) seconds, the whirligig will rotate five times in the same time period \( t \).

### Step 2: Determine the number of rotations for the thingamabob
Given that the whirligig spins at 121 meters per second, let’s denote the speed of the thingamabob as \( v \). The whirligig spins at five times the speed of the thingamabob, so the thingamabob must spin at a fraction of the whirligig’s speed. 

Since the whirligig spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, the thingamabob must spin \( \frac{v}{5} \) times in the same amount of time \( t \).

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rotations per second
If the thingamabob spins \( n \) times in one second, then the whirligig spins \( 5n \) times in the same time frame because they are related by their rotational speeds.

Given that the whirligig spins at 121 meters per second, and knowing that it spins 5 times faster than the thingamabob, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 5 \times (\text{thingamabob's rotation rate}) = 121 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of rotations per second for the thingamabob. Then the whirligig’s rotation rate would be \( 5x \).

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
From the above equation, we have:

\[ 5x = 121 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{121}{5} \]
\[ x = 24.2 \]

So, the thingamabob spins 24.2 times per second.

### Step 5: Calculate the whirligig’s speed
Since the thingamabob spins 24.2 times per second and the whirligig spins 5 times faster, the whirligig’s speed is:

\[ \text{Whirligig's speed} = 5 \times \text{thingamabob's speed} \]

Substituting \( x = 24.2 \):

\[ \text{Whirligig's speed} = 5 \times 24.2 \]
\[ \text{Whirligig's speed} = 121 \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at **121 meters per second**.<|im_end|>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.

To determine how much Ellen spends on one carrot per day, let's break down the information given:

1. **Identify the cost of the items:**
   - Salad: $6
   - Yogurt: Half the price of the salad = $3 (since the yogurt costs $3)

2. **Calculate the total daily expenditure excluding the carrots:**
   - Total spent on vegetables + yogurt = $11
   - Vegetables cost = $6 (carrots) + $3 (yogurt) = $9

3. **Determine the number of carrots consumed:**
   - Ellen consumes 2 carrots per day.

4. **Calculate the cost per carrot:**
   - Cost per carrot = Total cost of carrots / Number of carrots
   - Cost per carrot = $9 / 2 = $4.50

Therefore, Ellen pays $4.50 for one carrot every day. 

{The final answer is} The final answer is: \boxed{$4.50}<|im_end|>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

To determine how much Mark makes in a week after his raise, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Mark's original weekly earnings.
Mark worked for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.

\[ \text{Original Weekly Earnings} = 8 \times 5 \times \$10 \]

First calculate \(8 \times 5\):

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Then multiply by \$10:

\[ 40 \times 10 = 400 \]

So, Mark's original weekly earnings were \$400.

### Step 2: Determine the new hourly wage.
His pay was increased by \$2 per hour.

\[ \text{New Hourly Wage} = \$10 + \$2 = \$12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Mark's new weekly earnings.
He still works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.

\[ \text{New Weekly Earnings} = 8 \times 5 \times \$12 \]

First, calculate \(8 \times 5\):

\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]

Then multiply by \$12:

\[ 40 \times 12 = 480 \]

So, Mark's new weekly earnings are \$480.

                    Last month, Tasha made ? $80 ! from selling lemonade ! and mowing lawns. The first week, ; she ! mowed Kamala's lawn ? thrice as many times ! as she did Joe's. The following week, . she mowed , Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's. If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, how ; much did she make ? from lemonade , sales?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of times Joe mowed his lawn.
   - According to the problem, Tasha mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe. So, if \( x \) is the number of times Joe mowed, then Tasha mowed \( 3x \) times.
   - Since Tasha mowed both lawns, we have \( 3x + y = J \), where \( y \) is the number of times Tasha mowed her own lawn.

2. **Calculate the total earnings based on the number of lawns mowed:**
   - Tasha earns $6 per time she mows Joe's or Kamala's lawn.
   - Therefore, the total earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
     - Earnings from Joe's lawns: \( 3J \times 6 \)
     - Earnings from Kamala's lawns: \( y \times 6 \)

3. **Use the given information about Tasha's earnings:**
   - We know that Tasha made a total of $80 last month.
   - This includes earnings from mowing lawns plus earnings from selling lemonade.
   - Let \( L \) represent the amount earned from selling lemonade.
   - From the problem statement, \( L = 80 \).

4. **Set up an equation to find the relationship between Joe's and Tasha's lawmowing efforts:**
   - From the above steps, we can write the total earnings equation as:
     \[
     3J \times 6 + y \times 6 = 80
     \]
   - Simplify this equation:
     \[
     18J + 6y = 80
     \]

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - To isolate \( J \), divide the entire equation by 6:
     \[
     3J + y = \frac{80}{6}
     \]
     \[
     3J + y = \frac{40}{3}
     \]

6. **Find the value of \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( J \) back into the original equation to express \( y \):
     \[
     3\left(\frac{40}{9}\right) + y = \frac{40}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{40}{3} + y = \frac{40}{3}
     \]
     Subtract \(\frac{40}{3}\) from both sides:
     \[
     y = 0
     \]

7. **Determine the number of times Tasha mowed each lawn:**
   - Since \( y = 0 \), Tasha did not mow any of her own lawn.
   - Therefore, \( J = 0 \).

8. **Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns:**
   - With \( J = 0 \), the total earnings from mowing lawns is:
     \[
     3(0) \times 6 = 0
     \]

9. **Calculate the earnings from selling lemonade:**
   - Given \( L = 80 \) and knowing that all earnings come from selling lemonade:
     \[
     L = 80
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: The amount Tasha made from selling lemonade is $80.<|im_end|>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

To determine Harry's weight, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Carl's Weight
Given that Martin's weight is 55 kg and Carl's weight is ""more than"" Martin's weight by 16 kg.

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 + 16 \]

Performing the addition:

\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \]

So, Carl weighs 71 kg.

### Step 2: Determine Christian's Weight
Given that Carl's weight is ""more than"" Christian's weight by 8 kg.

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} - 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 - 8 \]

Performing the subtraction:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 63 \]

So, Christian weighs 63 kg.

### Step 3: Determine Harry's Weight
Given that Harry's weight is ""5 kg less"" than Christian's weight.

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 63 - 5 \]

Performing the subtraction:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 58 \]

So, Harry weighs 58 kg.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine John's profit from renting his car, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from renting the car**
John rents his car 10 times a month.
Each rental session lasts for 3 hours.

First, calculate the number of hours he earns in one month:
\[ \text{Total hours per month} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate his monthly earnings from renting:
\[ \text{Monthly earnings} = 30 \text{ hours} \times \$25/\text{hour} \]
\[ \text{Monthly earnings} = \$750 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the car payment from the earnings**
John has a monthly car payment of $500.

Now, subtract this payment from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Profit after payments} = \$750 - \$500 \]
\[ \text{Profit after payments} = \$250 \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car each month is **$250**.<|im_end|>","He rents his car 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 hour a month
So he makes 25*30=$<<25*30=750>>750 a month

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify initial quantities:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph has.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially has.

2. **Joseph has three times as many notebooks as Martha:**
   - This can be represented as: 
     \[
     J = 3M
     \]

3. **Martha buys additional notebooks:**
   - She buys 5 more notebooks to reach a total of 7 notebooks.
   - Therefore, before buying, she had:
     \[
     M - 5 = 7
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M - 5 = 7 \\
     M = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate Joseph’s notebooks:**
   - Using \( J = 3M \), we substitute \( M = 12 \):
     \[
     J = 3 \times 12 \\
     J = 36
     \]

5. **Determine how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph:**
   - Martha has 12 notebooks and Joseph has 36 notebooks.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     36 - 12 = 24
     \]

**Final Answer:** Martha now has 24 more notebooks than Joseph.<|im_end|>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks

To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Anis rowed compared to Dijana and then calculate their combined total distance.

Step 1: Determine how many miles Anis rowed.
Anis rowed 1/5 more miles than Dijana. Since Dijana rowed 50 miles:

\[ \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + (1/5) \times 50 \]

Calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \):

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, Anis rowed:

\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \] miles.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance both rowers covered together.

Add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \] miles.

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is:

2. **Cookies taken by husband**: The husband took 4 cookies before she could package them.
   
   So, after the husband took his share, the remaining cookies are:
   \[

3. **Number of people sharing the cookies**: Susan has 6 nephews plus herself, so there are 7 people in total.

4. **Equal division among nephews**: We need to divide the remaining 96 cookies equally among the 6 nephews and Susan.

5. **Calculate how many cookies each person gets**:
   \[
   \frac{96}{7} = 13 \text{ cookies per person}

### Step 2: Calculate how many pages Denise read on her first day.
Denise read 10 pages yesterday.

### Step 3: Determine how many pages Denise read today.
Today, Denise read 5 more pages than she did yesterday. Therefore:
\[ \text{Pages Denise read today} = 10 + 5 = 15 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many pages Daniel read today.
Since Daniel did not read any pages today, he read 0 pages.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of pages read by both Denise and Daniel over two days.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of people:**
   - Calvin (adult)
   - His wife (adult)
   - Two children (children)

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed:**
   - 4 bowls per person * 5 adults = 20 adult bowls
   - 8 bowls per child * 2 children = 16 child bowls
   - Total bowls needed = 20 + 16 = 36 bowls

3. **Check if Calvin’s pot can handle that amount:**
   - The pot can make soup for 4 adult bowls or 8 child bowls.
   - Since we need 36 bowls in total, let's see how many sets of these combinations fit into 36.

   \( \frac{36}{4} = 9 \) sets of adult bowls
   \( \frac{36}{8} = 4.5 \) sets of child bowls

Since 4.5 sets of child bowls would not allow us to feed everyone without leftovers, we'll focus on feeding the adults first.

4. **Determine the total number of bowls used:**
   - Each set consists of 4 adult bowls + 8 child bowls = 12 bowls per set

5. **Calculate how many full meals can be made:**
   - Number of full meals possible = \(\frac{36}{12} = 3\) meals

6. **Calculate how many bowls will be left over after these meals:**
   - After 3 full meals, we've used \(3 \times 12 = 36\) bowls.

7. **Distribute the remaining soup among the children:**
   - There are no children left to eat because all bowls were used up in the previous calculation.

Therefore, since there are no children left, each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

**Final Answer:** Each child cannot have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.<|im_end|>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.

Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

4. **Sum up both totals**:
   - Total spent on notebooks: $7.50
   - Total spent on ballpen: $0.50

To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Material Needed for Small Masks
- **Number of small masks**: 20
- **Material needed per small mask**: 4 masks * 2 yards = 8 yards

### Step 2: Calculate Material Needed for Large Masks
- **Number of large masks**: 8
- **Material needed per large mask**: 3 masks * 2.25 yards = 6.75 yards

### Step 3: Sum Up Total Material Required
- **Total material for small masks**: 20 masks * 8 yards = 160 yards
- **Total material for large masks**: 8 masks * 6.75 yards = 56.25 yards

### Step 4: Add Both Amounts Together
- **Total material required**:
  - Small masks: 160 yards
  - Large masks: 56.25 yards

Therefore, Jo would need **216.25 yards** of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

                    There are 9 Fast and the . Furious , movies, ! Deepa . has seen each one in the theatre three times. She ; has ! spent $216 seeing , these movies. What is the average price ? she paid ? per , ticket?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the average price Deepa pays for each movie ticket.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
Deepa saw all nine ""Fast and the Furious"" movies at least once in the theater. Therefore, she bought at least nine tickets.

Step 2: Determine how much money was spent on tickets.
Deepa spent a total of $216 on movie tickets.

Step 3: Divide the total amount spent by the number of tickets purchased.
\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{\text{number of tickets}} \]

Since we don't know exactly how many tickets Deepa bought (it could be more than nine), let's assume she bought only the minimum number which is nine.

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\$216}{9} = \$24 \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is:

To determine how much free time Harold has in a day, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Harold's work schedule
- **Sleep**: Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
  
### Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Harold works
- Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
\[ \text{Hours worked} = \text{Total sleep hours} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Hours worked} = 10 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Hours worked} = 8 \]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of hours Harold uses (sleep + work)
- Total usage = Sleep hours + Work hours
\[ \text{Total usage} = 10 (\text{sleep}) + 8 (\text{work}) \]
\[ \text{Total usage} = 18 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total usage from the total hours in a day
- There are 24 hours in a day.

Let’s perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Free time} = 24 (\text{total hours}) - 18 (\text{total usage}) \]
\[ \text{Free time} = 6 \]

### Final Answer:
Harold has 6 hours of free time left in his day. {The final answer is} 6.<|im_end|>","He works 2 hours less than he sleeps and he sleeps for 10 hours so he works 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of shoe boxes:**
   - Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes.
   - Tim has 9 red shoe boxes.
   - Total number of shoe boxes = Blue + Red = 7 + 9 = 16 shoe boxes.

2. **Calculate the number of shoe boxes used for fishing:**
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
   - The fraction of red shoe boxes used is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total red shoe boxes.
     \[
     \text{Number of red shoe boxes used} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes}
     \]

3. **Subtract the used shoe boxes from the initial totals:**

To determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some away, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of marbles given to Jamie:**
   - Dean starts with 30 marbles.
   - He gives away \(\frac{1}{5}\) of his marbles to Jamie.
   - To find out how many marbles he gives to Jamie, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
     \]

2. **Subtract the marbles given to Jamie from the total:**
   - After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, Dean has:
     \[
     30 - 6 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of marbles given to Donald:**
   - Dean then gives 10 marbles to Donald.

4. **Subtract the marbles given to Donald from the remaining amount:**
   - After giving 10 more marbles to Donald, Dean has:

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine Duncan's current age**:
   - We know that Duncan's current age is 60.

2. **Calculate Duncan's age eight years ago**:
   - Eight years ago, Duncan would have been \(60 - 8 = 52\) years old.

3. **Set up the relationship between their ages**:
   - According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago (52) is twice Adam's age four years ago.
   
4. **Define Adam's age four years ago**:
   - Let \(A\) represent Adam's age four years ago.
   - Therefore, \(2 \times A = 52\).

5. **Solve for Adam's age four years ago**:
   - From the equation \(2 \times A = 52\), we can find \(A\) as follows:
     \[
     A = \frac{52}{2} = 26
     \]
   - So, Adam's age four years ago was 26.

6. **Calculate Adam's current age**:
   - Since it has already passed four years since then, Adam's current age is:
     \[
     26 + 4 = 30
     \]

7. **Determine Adam's age in 8 years**:
   - To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
     \[
     30 + 8 = 38
     \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.<|im_end|>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.

Given:
- Farmer Brown's farm (F\_B): 200 acres.
- Farmer Smith's farm (F\_S): 100 acres more than twice as much as Farmer Brown’s farm.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We know:
\[ F_S = 2 \times F_B + 100 \]

From the information given about Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ F_B = 200 \]

   - According to the problem, Colby completes \(50 - 10 = 40\) packages per hour.

2. **Calculate the total number of packages completed in an eight-hour workday:**
   - Since he completes 40 packages per hour, in eight hours he will complete \(40 \times 8 = 320\) packages.

3. **Calculate the total earnings based on the number of packages completed:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for completing 320 packages would be \(320 \times 0.20 = \$64\).

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it takes for John to complete an ""extreme"" Sudoku puzzle and then calculate how many bottles of water he consumes during that time.

1. **Determine the time for an extreme Sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme Sudoku puzzle takes 4 times longer than a normal one.
   
   \[
   \text{Time for extreme Sudoku} = 4 \times 45 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the total time John spends on extreme Sudoku puzzles:**
   - We already know the time for a normal Sudoku puzzle (45 minutes).
   - The time for an extreme Sudoku puzzle is \(4 \times 45\) minutes.

3. **Convert the time spent on extreme Sudoku puzzles into hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert the time from minutes to hours.
   
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{4 \times 45}{60}
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Simplify the multiplication first:
     \[
     4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Then divide by 60 to get the equivalent in hours:
     \[
     \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of bottles of water consumed:**
   - John drinks 1 bottle of water every half hour.
   - To find out how many half-hour intervals fit into 3 hours, multiply 3 by 2 (since there are two half-hours in an hour):
   
   \[
   \text{Number of half-hour intervals} = 3 \times 2 = 6

   - Benny threw 58 pieces.

2. **Determine the number of red balloons:**
   - Twenty out of the total balloons were red.
   
3. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons:**
   - Total balloons = Red balloons + Yellow balloons
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Therefore, \( 20 + y \) must equal the total number of balloons.

4. **Set up an equation based on the given information about the pieces of bologna:**
   - Each red balloon gets 2 pieces of bologna.
   - Each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna.
   - The total number of pieces thrown is 58.
   - We can write this as: \( 2 \times 20 + 3y = 58 \).

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation: \( 40 + 3y = 58 \).
   - Subtract 40 from both sides: \( 3y = 18 \).
   - Divide both sides by 3: \( y = 6 \).

Therefore, there are 6 yellow balloons in the bundle. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{6}\).<|im_end|>","If Benny had twenty red balloons in the bundle, and he threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, then he threw 2*20=40 pieces of bologna at red balloons in the bundle.

To determine how many tune-ups Jon will need in a 30-day month, let's follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in 30 days.
Jon drives 100 miles per day.

Total miles driven = Number of days × Miles per day
= 30 days × 100 miles/day
= 3000 miles

Step 2: Determine how often Jon needs a tune-up based on his driving distance.
A tune-up is needed every 1000 miles.

Step 3: Calculate the number of tune-ups required by dividing the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups.
Number of tune-ups = Total miles driven ÷ Interval between tune-ups
= 3000 miles ÷ 1000 miles/tune-up
= 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs to have a tune-up after driving 3000 miles. Since this calculation is done at the end, we can conclude:

                    question:
                    Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. On Wednesday he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. On ; Thursday he works 2 hours . less than , the ; time ? he works on Wednesday. How , many hours does Bruce work in all these three . days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the time Bruce works on Wednesday.
- **Tuesday:** Bruce works for 5 hours.
- **Wednesday:** He works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
\[ \text{Time on Wednesday} = 2 \times (\text{Time on Tuesday}) \]
\[ \text{Time on Wednesday} = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Time on Wednesday} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time Bruce works on Thursday.
- **Thursday:** He works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
\[ \text{Time on Thursday} = \text{Time on Wednesday} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Time on Thursday} = 10 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Time on Thursday} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days.
- **Total hours**:
\[ \text{Total hours} = \text{Time on Monday} + \text{Time on Tuesday} + \text{Time on Wednesday} + \text{Time on Thursday} \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 5 + 10 + 8 \]
\[ \text{Total hours} = 23 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 23 hours.<|im_end|>","On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.
On Thursday, Bruce works for 10 – 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 hours.
On these three days, Bruce works for 5 + 10 + 8 = <<5+10+8=23>>23 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) be the total amount of allowance that both Julia and Nadine received from their mother.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Spending
- Cake cost = $11
- Balloons (since they bought 1 dozen at $0.5 per balloon):
  - Number of balloons in a dozen = 12
  - Cost per balloon = $0.5
  - Total cost for balloons = \( 12 \times 0.5 = $6 \)

- Ice cream (for 2 tubs at $7 each):
  - Cost for ice cream = \( 2 \times 7 = $14 \)

Total spent = $11 + $6 + $14 = $31

### Step 3: Determine Remaining Money
Since they have already spent $31 out of their allowance \( x \), the remaining money must equal the allowance \( x \).

### Step 4: Set Up Equation
From Step 3, we know that \( x - 31 = x \). This equation simplifies to \( 31 = 0 \), but this doesn't make sense because we're dealing with allowances. Let's reframe our thinking slightly: the remaining money after spending should equal the original allowance.

Given that the remaining money equals the allowance \( x \), we can write:
\[ x - 31 = x \]

This implies that \( x \) must be such that the allowance minus what they spent equals the allowance itself. Since they combined their allowances, the total allowance is twice the individual allowances. Let's denote their individual allowances as \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \):

\[ y_1 + y_2 = x \]

Since they spend $31 together, the remaining money after spending should be half of the total allowance. Therefore, the remaining money ($19) should be equal to half of the total allowance (because they split the allowance equally):

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 19 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 38 \]

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $19.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is {The final answer is}. Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $19.<|im_end|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.

The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

2. **Subtract the number of fruits that Lola ate from the total number of fruits:**
   - Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

   Number of fruits left = Total number of fruits - Number of fruits eaten

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of students playing volleyball**

Given:
- There are 6 students playing tennis.
- The number of students playing volleyball is twice that of tennis.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times \text{Number of tennis players} \]
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 12 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students involved (including both groups)**

Given:
- Number of boys playing soccer = 16
- Number of girls playing soccer = 22

Total number of students:
\[ \text{Total students} = \text{Number of tennis players} + \text{Number of volleyball players} + \text{Number of boys playing soccer} + \text{Number of girls playing soccer} \]
\[ \text{Total students} = 6 + 12 + 16 + 22 \]

2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold
- There are 30 students.
- Each student sold 10 lollipops.
\[ \text{Total number of lollipops} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops
- The price of each lollipop is $0.8.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.8 = \$240 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops
- The cost of each lollipop is $0.5.
\[ \text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.5 = \$150 \]

### Step 4: Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pets Larry has based on the information provided about his different types of pets.

Step 1: Determine the number of cats.
Larry has 3 cats.

Step 2: Calculate the number of dogs.
He has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
Number of dogs = 3 * 3 = 9

Step 3: Calculate the number of rabbits.
He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7

Step 4: Calculate the number of fish.
He has three times the number of fish as rabbits.
Number of fish = 3 * 7 = 21

Step 5: Determine the number of gerbil collections.
He has one-third the number of gerbils as fish.
Number of gerbil collections = 1 / 3 * 21 = 7

Now, let's add up all the pet categories to find the total number of pets Larry has:

Total number of pets = Number of cats + Number of dogs + Number of rabbits + Number of fish + Number of gerbil collections
Total number of pets = 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils)

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, let's break this down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the total time available for picking berries:**
   The sloth has 8 hours to complete all its trips.

2. **Calculate the total number of trips needed to collect 24 berries:**
   Since the sloth needs to return up the tree after picking berries, we need to consider that each trip involves one trip down and one trip up.
   
   Let \( n \) be the number of trips the sloth makes. Each trip consists of going down (down-trip) and then coming back up (up-trip). So, for each trip, the total time spent is \( T_{\text{trip}} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \) hours because each round trip takes 4 hours.

3. **Set up an equation based on the total time available:**
   The total time required for all trips should not exceed 8 hours. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   n \times 8 \leq 8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( n \):**
   \[
   n \leq 1
   \]
   This means the sloth must make at least one trip to collect 24 berries within the given time frame.

5. **Determine the minimum number of berries picked per trip:**
   If the sloth makes exactly one trip, it will take 4 hours for the entire process. Since the sloth collects 24 berries in 8 hours, the maximum rate of berry collection during one trip is:
   \[
   \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ berries per hour}
   \]
   To find out how many berries the sloth can pick up in one trip, divide the total berries collected by the total time taken:
   \[
   \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24}{n}
   \]
   Since \( n = 1 \), the slope picks up the maximum possible number of berries in one trip:
   \[
   \text{Berries per trip} = 24
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip such that it still manages to collect 24 berries within the 8-hour limit is 24 berries per trip.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If one trip is 4-hours long, in 8 hours he can make 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 trips.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the initial volume of water in the tank.
2. Calculate the volume of water that is added to the tank using the pump.
3. Calculate the total volume of water used for watering the garden over 6 days.
4. Subtract the volume used for watering the garden from the total volume of water in the tank.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Initial Volume of Water in the Tank
The problem states that there are initially 10000 gallons of water in the pool. Since they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool, we can calculate the initial volume of water in the tank as follows:
\[ \text{Initial volume of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10000 = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

### Step 2: Volume of Water Added to the Tank
Anthony and his father use a water pump to fill the tank. The problem does not specify the capacity or efficiency of the pump, but it mentions that they fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, if they fill the tank to its full capacity (which is twice the initial volume), then:
\[ \text{Volume of water added to the tank} = 10000 \text{ gallons} \]

### Step 3: Total Volume of Water Used for Gardening
They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. The problem specifies that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total volume of water used for gardening would be:
\[ \text{Total volume of water used for gardening} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

### Step 4: Remaining Volume in the Tank
After accounting for the water used for gardening, the remaining volume of water in the tank would be:
\[ \text{Remaining volume of water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is **2000** gallons.<|im_end|>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.
If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more movies Colby can watch given his current spending habits, let's break down the information:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Spending Per Month
First, we need to calculate how much money Colby spends per month.

- **Friday tickets**: $10
- **Saturday tickets**: $10
- **Other days (Monday-Sunday)**: $7 each
- **Popcorn**: $8
- **Candy**: $2 per box

Let's assume there are 4 weeks in a month.

#### Week 1 (First Friday):
- **Tickets**: 1 ticket * $10 = $10
- **Popcorn**: 1 tub * $8 = $8
- **Candy**: 1 box * $2 = $2
Total for Week 1: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

#### Week 2 (Second Friday):
- **Tickets**: 1 ticket * $10 = $10
- **Popcorn**: 1 tub * $8 = $8
- **Candy**: 1 box * $2 = $2
Total for Week 2: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

#### Week 3 (Third Friday):
- **Tickets**: 1 ticket * $10 = $10
- **Popcorn**: 1 tub * $8 = $8
- **Candy**: 1 box * $2 = $2
Total for Week 3: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

#### Week 4 (Fourth Friday):
- **Tickets**: 1 ticket * $10 = $10
- **Popcorn**: 1 tub * $8 = $8
- **Candy**: 1 box * $2 = $2
Total for Week 4: $10 + $8 + $2 = $20

**Total monthly spending:**
$20 (Week 1) + $20 (Week 2) + $20 (Week 3) + $20 (Week 4) = $80

### Step 2: Determine Remaining Money After Previous Movies
Colby has seen 5 movies on Fridays and 8 movies on other days. We need to find out how many movies he has seen so far.

- **Fridays**: 5 movies * $10 = $50
- **Other Days**: 8 movies * $10 = $80

**Total spent so far:** $50 (Fridays) + $80 (other days) = $130

Since Colby only earns $150 per month, he cannot afford to buy popcorn or candy unless he goes back to work or finds another source of income.

### Step 3: Calculate Maximum Number of Additional Movies
Given his current earnings, he can't afford to go to additional movies this month because he needs $150 to cover all expenses. Therefore, he will not be able to go to any more movies based on his current spending habits.

### Conclusion
Colby can currently not afford to go to any more movies this month as he will run out of money before he reaches his goal of seeing additional movies. Thus, he would have to wait until next month to consider going to more movies.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 0 movies.<|im_end|>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins baked.
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.

Total pastries = 200 (mini cinnamon rolls) + 300 (mini blueberry muffins)

\[ \text{Total pastries} = 200 + 300 = 500 \]

### Step 2: Determine the calorie content for one mini pastry.
A normal cinnamon roll contains 600 calories, so a normal cinnamon roll contains twice that amount because it's 1/3rd of a mini cinnamon roll.

Calories in one normal cinnamon roll = \( 600 \times 2 = 1200 \) calories

Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll contains:

\[ \frac{1200}{3} = 400 \] calories

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin contains 450 calories, so a normal blueberry muffin contains three times that amount because it's 1/3rd of a mini blueberry muffin.

Calories in one normal blueberry muffin = \( 450 \times 3 = 1350 \) calories

Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin contains:

\[ \frac{1350}{3} = 450 \] calories

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories from mini cinnamon rolls.
Since there are 200 mini cinnamon rolls:

\[ 200 \times 400 = 80,000 \] calories

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of calories from mini blueberry muffins.
Since there are 300 mini blueberry muffins:

\[ 300 \times 450 = 135,000 \] calories

### Step 5: Sum up all the calories from both types of mini pastries.
\[ 80,000 (\text{calories from mini cinnamon rolls}) + 135,000 (\text{calories from mini blueberry muffins}) = 215,000 \] calories

### Final Answer:
The pastries Andrew baked contain a total of **215,000** calories.<|im_end|>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories

Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

<|im_start|>wait
To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   - Monday: \(39\)
   - Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
   - Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
   - Thursday: \(48\)
   - Friday: \(57\)

   Adding them up gives us:
   \[
   39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   There are 5 days in this period.

   The average can be found by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of Junebugs}}{\text{Number of days}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{300}{5}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = 60
   \]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs

                    question:
                    A bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour , for 8 hours. How much farther did , the bus go than the car, in miles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between those distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the bus**

- The formula for distance is given by \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
  
- For the bus: 
\[ \text{distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} \]

- Simplify this expression:
\[ \text{distance}_{\text{bus}} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car**

- Similarly, for the car:
\[ \text{distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} \]

- Simplify this expression:
\[ \text{distance}_{\text{car}} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Find the difference in distance**

- To find out how much farther the bus traveled, subtract the distance covered by the car from the distance covered by the bus.
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus went **60 miles farther** than the car.<|im_end|>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bouncy balls were in the tube that Sophie bought.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Total Number of Toys Sophie Has Now:**
   - We know Sophie's current total number of toys for her nephew is 62.
   
2. **Determine the Current Count of Each Type of Toy:**
   - Sophie currently has 31 building blocks.
   - She also has 8 stuffed animals.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of stacking ring toys (since these have already been accounted for).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Number of Toys After Adding the Building Blocks:**
   - Since there are 31 building blocks, subtracting them from the total gives us the remaining number of toys before adding the other items.
   \[
   62 - 31 = 31
   \]
   This means after adding the building blocks, Sophie still needs to add 31 more toys.

4. **Add the Stuffed Animals:**
   - Sophie now adds 8 stuffed animals.
   \[
   31 + 8 = 39
   \]
   At this point, she has 39 toys.

5. **Subtract the Remaining Toys Before Adding the Bouncy Balls:**
   - We need to find out what toys were left before adding the bouncy balls. So, let’s assume \( y \) is the number of additional toys added before the bouncy balls.
   \[
   39 - y = 30
   \]

6. **Determine the Number of Bouncy Balls Added:**
   - We know that Sophie buys a tube containing \( z \) bouncy balls.
   \[
   z = 62 - 30
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   z = 32
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Sophie bought 32 bouncy balls.

Thus, the final answer is: 
\[

To solve this problem, let's define some variables:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.
- Let \( P_J \) be Paul's age.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul's age and John's age.

Let's start by expressing these relationships mathematically:

1. The combined age equation:
\[ P + P_J + J = 100 \]

2. The relationship between Peter's age and Paul and John's ages:
\[ P = P_J + J \]

Now, substitute the second equation into the first equation:
\[ (P_J + J) + P_J + J = 100 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2(P_J + J) = 100 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ P_J + J = 50 \]

So far, we have:
\[ P_J = 50 - J \]

Since \( P = P_J + J \), substitute \( P_J \):
\[ P = (50 - J) + J \]
Simplify:
\[ P = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \(\boxed{50}\).<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

### Step 4: Calculate the maximum number of tables that can be set up with the current total boxes.
- Divide the total boxes by the number of boxes per table.
\[ \text{Maximum tables} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

### Step 5: Calculate how many more tables are needed after accounting for the existing tables.
- They currently have 15 tables.
- To find out how many more tables are needed, subtract the current number of tables from the maximum possible number of tables.
\[ \text{New tables needed} = 30 - 15 = 15 \]

### Final Answer:
The charity group needs **15** new tables for their yard sale.<|im_end|>","There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the average total distance that Zoey and Sydney have spit their seeds, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance Zoey has spat.
Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet.

\[
\text{Total distance Zoey has spat} = 40 \times 10 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
= 400 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance Sydney has spat.
Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet.

\[
\text{Total distance Sydney has spat} = 35 \times 12 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
= 420 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Find the combined total distance they both have spat.
Add the distances from Zoey and Sydney together.

\[
\text{Combined total distance} = 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}
\]

\[
= 820 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the average total distance.
To find the average, divide the combined total distance by the number of participants (which is 2).

\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2}
\]

\[
= 410 \text{ feet}
\]

### Final Answer:
The average total distance spat is \(410\) feet.<|im_end|>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 over the WidgetMaster 9000 in terms of widgets produced per day and then over a month with 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in one day.
2. Determine the total number of widgets each machine produces in a month (30 days).
3. Compare the total widgets produced by both machines.

### Step 1: Widgets per Day Calculation

- **Widgeteer 3000**:
  - Produces 60 widgets per hour.
  - Since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily production is:
    \[
    60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
    \]

- **WidgetMaster 9000**:
  - Produces 45 widgets per hour.
  - Similarly, since there are 24 hours in a day, the daily production is:
    \[
    45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}
    \]

### Step 2: Total Widgets Produced Over 30 Days

- **Widgeteer 3000**:
  - Produces 1440 widgets per day.
  - Over 30 days, the total production is:
    \[
    1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43,200 \text{ widgets}
    \]

- **WidgetMaster 9000**:
  - Produces 1080 widgets per day.
  - Over 30 days, the total production is:
    \[
    1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 32,400 \text{ widgets}
    \]

### Step 3: Difference in Production

Now, let's calculate the difference in total widgets produced by the two machines over the same period:

\[
43,200 \text{ widgets} - 32,400 \text{ widgets} = 10,800 \text{ widgets}
\]

Therefore, Fern will produce **10,800 more widgets** from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over the course of 30 days.

This means that the Widgeteer 3000 will generate **more revenue** than the WidgetMaster 9000 because each widget sold at $6 results in a higher revenue contribution due to producing more widgets in a given time frame.<|im_end|>","First find how many more widgets the Widgeteer 3000 makes per hour: 60 widgets/hour - 45 widgets/hour = <<60-45=15>>15 widgets/hour
Then multiply that difference by the number of hours in a day to find the daily difference: 15 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = <<360=360>>360 widgets/day
Then multiply the daily difference by the number of days in a month to find the monthly difference: 360 widgets/day * 30 days/month = <<360*30=10800>>10,800 widgets/month
Then multiply that number by the cost per widget to find the total earnings difference: 10,800 widgets/month * $6/widget = $<<10800*6=64800>>64,800

                    question:
                    A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 : hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at . the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Cameron saves, we need to compare the total costs of staying for both options (12-hour and 24-hour) and then calculate the difference between these two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost under the 12-hour option.
- **Cost per 12-hour stay**: 1000 pesos.
- **Total time spent**: 12 hours.
- **Additional charge for any extra hours beyond 12 hours**: 70 pesos per hour.

Since Cameron stays for exactly 12 hours, he does not incur any additional charges.

Thus, the total cost remains the same as the initial price for a 12-hour stay.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 1000 \text{ pesos} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost under the 24-hour option.
- **Cost per 24-hour stay**: 1600 pesos.
- **Total time spent**: 24 hours.

For Cameron's stay, since he only uses part of the 24-hour period (from 5 PM to 10 AM), we need to calculate the number of full days and hours he spends.

- **Number of full days**: \( \frac{24}{24} = 1 \) day.
- **Remaining hours**: \( 24 - 24 = 0 \) hours.

So, Cameron stays for exactly one full day from 5 PM to 10 AM.

- **Additional charge for remaining hours**: Since there are no remaining hours, this part of the calculation is zero.

Therefore, the total cost for Cameron's stay is:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 1600 \text{ pesos} \]

### Step 3: Compare the costs.
- **12-hour stay cost**: 1000 pesos.
- **24-hour stay cost**: 1600 pesos.

### Step 4: Determine savings.
- **Savings**: Subtract the lower cost (12-hour stay) from the higher cost (24-hour stay).

\[ \text{Savings} = 1600 \text{ pesos} - 1000 \text{ pesos} = 600 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, Cameron would save **600 pesos** by choosing the 12-hour stay option over the 24-hour stay option.<|im_end|>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                    question:
                    Nate is feeding his livestock hay. Each goat : needs 5 pounds, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount : each goat needs. If there ; are 15 goats . and 12 sheep, how ; many ? pounds of hay , does Nate : need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much hay Nate needs for his livestock, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of animals.
Nate has 15 goats and 12 sheep.

\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 15 (\text{goats}) + 12 (\text{sheep}) = 27 \]

### Step 2: Determine the daily hay requirement for each type of animal.
- **Goat**: Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay per day.

\[
\text{Hay required for one goat per day} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

- **Sheep**: Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what each goat needs.

First, calculate twice the amount needed for a goat:

\[
2 \times 5 \text{ (pounds per goat)} = 10 \text{ (pounds per goat)}
\]

Then subtract 3 from that amount to find out how much each sheep needs:

\[
10 \text{ (pounds per goat)} - 3 \text{ (pounds per sheep)} = 7 \text{ (pounds per sheep)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total hay requirement for all animals.
Now, multiply the number of each type of animal by their respective daily hay requirements.

For the goats:
\[
15 (\text{goats}) \times 5 \text{ (pounds per goat)} = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the sheep:
\[
12 (\text{sheep}) \times 7 \text{ (pounds per sheep)} = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Add the total amounts together.
Finally, add the hay requirements for both goats and sheep to get the total amount of hay needed.

\[
75 \text{ (pounds for goats)} + 84 \text{ (pounds for sheep)} = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Conclusion:
Nate needs a total of \( \boxed{159} \) pounds of hay for his livestock over the course of a day.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep

Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate John's total earnings for the week.
John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours.

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \$50 \times 6 = \$300
\]

So, John earned a total of $300 over the course of the week.

### Step 2: Determine the amount left after expenses.
John has spent $50 on gas.

\[
\text{Amount Left After Gas Expenses} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Gas Expenses}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Amount Left After Gas Expenses} = \$300 - \$50 = \$250
\]

Now, John wants to deposit $100 in his bank account.

\[
\text{Remaining Amount After Bank Deposit} = \text{Amount Left After Gas Expenses} - \text{Bank Deposit}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount After Bank Deposit} = \$250 - \$100 = \$150
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of 25-dollar pen sets John can buy.
Each set costs $25.

\[
\text{Number of Sets} = \frac{\text{Remaining Amount}}{\text{Cost per Set}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of Sets} = \frac{\$150}{\$25} = 6
\]

So, John can buy 6 sets of 25-dollar pens.

### Final Answer:
After buying 5 pencils costing $10 each, John will have enough money from selling the pens to make 6 purchases of 25-dollar pens. Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: The number of 25-dollar pen sets John can buy is **6**.<|im_end|>","He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300

### Step 1: Determine the total number of letters Craig has spelled.

Craig has already spelled 20 words with 15 letters each.

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of children participating in the drill, we need to consider both the number of students per row and the number of rows per school.

1. **Number of Children Per Row**: 
   - The children are arranged in 8 rows.
   - Each row contains 8 children.

2. **Number of Rows Per School**:
   - There are 7 schools, and each school has 7 rows.
   - Therefore, each school has \(7 \times 7 = 49\) rows (since each row counts as one row).

3. **Total Number of Rows Across All Schools**:
   - Since there are 7 schools, the total number of rows is \(7 \times 49\).
   - Calculate this: \(7 \times 49 = 343\) rows.

4. **Total Number of Children**:
   - To find the total number of children, multiply the number of rows by the number of children per row.
   - Total number of children = \(343 \times 8\).

2. **Calculate the total number of coupons used:**
   - Each coupon can be used to buy 100 bottles of apple juice.
   - Since there are 9 coupons available, they will be used entirely.
   \[
   9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}

3. **Subtract the used bottles from the initial amount:**
   - Initial number of bottles = 900 (after using coupons)
   - Bottles left after redemption = Initial bottles - Used bottles
   \[
   900 - 900 = 0 \text{ bottles remaining}

                    Patty's ! Plumbing charges $40 , to ; visit a house ! to make a repair, plus $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor, plus parts. One job took 2.25 . hours and ; used $60 in parts. How much ; did Patty ? charge?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much Patty charged for her plumbing service, we need to break down the costs into their components and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the base cost**: Patty's initial fee for visiting a house is $40.
   
2. **Calculate the labor cost**: The total time spent on the job is 2.25 hours, and she charges $35 per hour for labor. So, the labor cost is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 2.25 \times 35
   \]

3. **Subtract the parts cost from the labor cost**: Since $60 was used for parts, we subtract this amount from the labor cost to find out how much Patty earned from the labor alone:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Labor Cost} = (2.25 \times 35) - 60
   \]

4. **Add the remaining labor cost to the base fee**: Now, add the remaining labor cost to the base fee to get the total amount charged by Patty.

Let's do these calculations step-by-step:

1. Base fee: $40
2. Calculate labor cost:
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75
   \]
3. Subtract parts cost from labor cost:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Labor Cost} = 78.75 - 60 = 18.75
   \]
4. Add the remaining labor cost to the base fee:
   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 18.75 = 58.75
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Patty charged is $\boxed{58.75}$.<|im_end|>","She charged for 3 hours.

                    question:
                    James gets 10 new CDs.  Each CD cost $15.  He gets them for 40% off.  He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40. How much money was he , out?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the original total cost before any discounts or sales**

James buys 10 CDs at $15 each.

\[ \text{Original Total Cost} = 10 \times \$15 = \$150 \]

**Step 2: Apply the 40% discount**

A 40% discount means he pays 60% of the original price (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

\[ \text{Discounted Price per CD} = \$15 \times 0.60 = \$9 \]

Now calculate the total cost after applying the discount to all 10 CDs.

\[ \text{Total Discounted Cost} = 10 \times \$9 = \$90 \]

So far, we have subtracted $90 from the original $150, leaving us with:

\[ \$150 - \$90 = \$60 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many CDs were sold and their selling prices**

James initially bought 10 CDs but decided not to like 5 of them. So, he only sells 5 CDs.

He sells these 5 CDs for $40 each.

\[ \text{Total Sale Amount} = 5 \times \$40 = \$200 \]

However, since he has already spent $60 on the discounted CDs, he hasn't yet earned any profit from the sale. We need to consider his initial investment in terms of the CDs he didn't sell.

**Step 4: Calculate the net loss**

Since he didn't earn enough from the sale to cover his initial investment ($60), he incurs a loss.

Therefore, the amount of money he lost is equal to his initial investment.

\[ \text{Net Loss} = \$60 \]

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: The final answer is $\boxed{\$60}$<|im_end|>","He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling all the different types of vegetables. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the earnings from yams
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam can be sold for $1.5.

\[
\text{Earnings from yams} = 6 \times \$1.5 = \$9
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the earnings from sweet potatoes
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato costs $2.

\[
\text{Earnings from sweet potatoes} = 10 \times \$2 = \$20
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings from carrots
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot costs $1.25.

\[
\text{Earnings from carrots} = 4 \times \$1.25 = \$5
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the earnings
Now, let's add up the earnings from each type of vegetable:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \$9 + \$20 + \$5 = \$34
\]

Therefore, if Jen sells everything, she will earn **$34**.<|im_end|>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into segments and calculate the time spent in each segment.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total distance:**
   The total distance James needs to swim is 20 miles.

2. **Determine the first part of the journey:**
   James swims 60% of the total distance.
   
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to swim the first part:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   
   \[
   \text{Time to swim first part} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine the second part of the journey:**
   James swims the remaining 40% of the total distance.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 0.40 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to swim the second part:**
   Since James swims at the same pace (2 miles per hour) but takes longer because he's only swimming half the distance,
   
   \[
   \text{Time to swim second part} = \frac{\text{Remaining Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the rest time:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   
   \[
   \text{Rest Time} = \frac{\text{Swimming Time}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time:**
   Add up all the times calculated above.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{First Part Time} + \text{Second Part Time} + \text{Rest Time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 13 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total time it took James to get across the lake is \(13\) hours.<|im_end|>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.

He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday.
   - The bakery has fewer than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam.

2. **Calculate seven times the number of loaves Sam had:**
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
   So, the bakery would have at least 490 loaves of bread based on the condition that they have ""fewer than"" seven times as many loaves as Sam.

3. **Determine the actual number of loaves in the bakery:**
   - Since the bakery has fewer than 490 loaves but more than zero, we need to find the smallest integer greater than 0 that satisfies this condition.
   
   Let’s denote the number of loaves in the bakery as \( x \). We know:
   \[
   0 < x < 490
   \]

4. **Find the exact number of loaves in the bakery:**
   - The smallest value for \( x \) (greater than 0) that satisfies \( 0 < x < 490 \) is just slightly above 0.
   - However, since the problem asks for the number of loaves and implies a specific numerical answer, we should consider practical limits. Given no other constraints, the simplest interpretation would be the next whole number after 0, which is 1.

5. **Verify if 1 fits within the range:**
   - If the bakery has 1 loaf, then:
     \[
     1 < 490
     \]
   This condition holds true.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the bakery has exactly 1 loaf of bread.

Thus, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 1 loaf of bread.<|im_end|>","If Sam had seventy loaves of bread last Friday, seven times that number is 7*70 = 490 loaves.

1. **Calculate the commission from the New York Times:**
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Number of copies: 6
   - Cost per copy: $5
   
   \[
   \text{Commission from New York Times} = \left( \frac{10}{100} \right) \times 6 \times 5 = 3 \times 5 = \$15
   \]

2. **Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Number of copies: 10
   - Cost per copy: $15
   
   \[
   \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = \left( \frac{8}{100} \right) \times 10 \times 15 = 0.08 \times 10 \times 15 = 0.8 \times 10 \times 15 = 8 \times 15 = \$120
   \]

3. **Sum the commissions from both newspapers:**

\[
\text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission from New York Times} + \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal}
\]
\[
\text{Total Commission} = \$15 + \$120 = \$135

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given:

1. **Step 1: Define Variables**
   Let's define \( L \) as Leo's age.

2. **Step 2: Translate Information into Equations**
   - Marcus is half of Leo's age.
     \[
     M = \frac{L}{2}
     \]
   - Marcus is also five years younger than Deanna.
     \[
     M = D - 5
     \]
   - We know Deanna's age (D = 26).
     \[
     D = 26
     \]

3. **Substitute Deanna's Age into Marcus' Equation**
   Using the value for Deanna's age in the equation for Marcus:
   \[
   M = D - 5 \implies M = 26 - 5 \implies M = 21
   \]

4. **Find Leo's Age from Marcus' Equation**
   Now that we have Marcus' age (\(M\)), we can use it to find Leo's age using the equation relating Marcus and Leo's ages:
   \[
   M = \frac{L}{2} \implies 21 = \frac{L}{2}
   \]

5. **Solve for Leo's Age**
   To find Leo's age (\(L\)), multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   21 \times 2 = L \implies L = 42
   \]

### Conclusion
Leo is 42 years old. Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( A \) represent the number of points Azibo scored.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of points Bahati scored.
   Let \( D \) represent the number of points Dinar scored.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Bahati scored the most points, so \( B > A \).
   - It was 20 more points than Azibo, so \( B = A + 20 \).
   - It was also 10 more points than Dinar, so \( B = D + 10 \).

3. **Express Total Points:**
   The total points scored by all three members is 45, so we have:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

4. **Substitute the Known Relationships into the Equation:**
   From \( B = A + 20 \), substitute \( B \) in the equation \( B + A + D = 45 \):
   \[
   (A + 20) + A + D = 45
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2A + 20 + D = 45
   \]

5. **Solve for \( D \):**
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \( D \):
   \[
   2A + D = 45 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2A + D = 25
   \]

6. **Solve for \( A \):**
   Substitute \( D = 25 - 2A \) back into the relationship \( B = A + 20 \):
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

7. **Substitute \( B \) and \( D \) into the Total Points Equation:**
   Now that we know \( B \) and \( D \) in terms of \( A \), substitute them into \( B + A + D = 45 \):
   \[
   (A + 20) + A + (25 - 2A) = 45
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   A + 20 + A + 25 - 2A = 45
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   25 = 45 - 20
   \]

8. **Verify Solutions:**
   Check if these values satisfy all conditions:
   - \( B = A + 20 \)
   - \( B = 25 \)
   - \( D = 25 - 2A \)

9. **Calculate \( A \):**
   If \( B = 25 \), then \( A + 20 = 25 \), so \( A = 5 \).

10. **Check Values:**
    - \( B = 25 \)
    - \( D = 25 - 2(5) = 15 \)
    - \( A = 5 \)

Thus, Azibo scored \( \boxed{5} \) points.<|im_end|>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many pages fit on one side of the paper.
- We know that there are 100 pages per inch of paper.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pages fit on one side of the stack.
- Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we need to determine how many pages fit on one side of the stack.
\[ \text{Pages per inch} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Number of inches in the stack} = 1.5 \]

So,
\[ \text{Pages on one side} = 100 \times 1.5 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages in the book.
- Now that we have the number of pages on one side, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying by two (since the book has pages on both sides).

Let's do the calculations:

\[ \text{Pages on one side} = 100 \times 1.5 = 150 \]

Since the book has pages on both sides:
\[ \text{Total pages in the book} = 150 \times 2 \]

Finally, let's compute the total number of pages in the book:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 150 \times 2 = 300 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.  ? If he was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, how many reports did he staple altogether?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many reports Vince staples in total during his work shift, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the duration of Vince's work session**:
   - Vince works from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.
   - The total time worked is \(11:00 \text{ PM} - 8:00 \text{ AM}\).
   - Convert both times to a common format (e.g., hours and minutes):
     - 11:00 PM = 23:00
     - 8:00 AM = 8:00
   - Subtracting these gives us: \(23:00 - 08:00 = 17\) hours.

2. **Determine the rate at which Vince staples reports**:
   - Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.

3. **Convert the time per report into a more manageable unit for calculation**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To find out how many 15-minute intervals there are in one hour, divide 60 by 15:
     \[
     \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ intervals}
     \]
   - This means Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes, or 4 intervals per hour.

4. **Calculate the total number of reports Vince staples**:
   - Since Vince works for 17 hours, multiply the number of intervals per hour by the number of hours:
     \[
     17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ intervals}
     \]

5. **Finalize the calculation**:
   - Each interval corresponds to 30 reports, so:
     \[
     68 \times 30 = 2040 \text{ reports}
     \]

Therefore, Vince staples a total of 2040 reports over the course of his work shift.<|im_end|>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).

To determine how much time Kim actually spent asleep that day, we need to break down the information provided and calculate accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total duration of sleep-walking**:
   - From 2:15 AM to 2:38 AM.
   - Duration = 2:38 AM - 2:15 AM = 23 minutes (since both times are in the same hour).

2. **Calculate the difference between normal waking time and actual wake-up time**:
   - Normally, Kim wakes up at 6:00 AM.
   - On this particular day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier to use the restroom.
   - Therefore, her actual wake-up time was 5 minutes before 6:00 AM, which means it was 5:55 AM.

3. **Calculate the total time from when she went to bed until she used the restroom**:
   - Her normal bedtime is 10:00 PM.
   - Using the restroom at 5:55 AM would be part of her normal sleep period.
   - Total time from 10:00 PM to 5:55 AM = 4 hours and 55 minutes.

4. **Subtract the sleep-walking duration from the total time slept**:
   - Total time from 10:00 PM to 5:55 AM = 4 hours 55 minutes.
   - Sleep-walking duration = 23 minutes.
   - Time spent asleep = 4 hours 55 minutes - 23 minutes = 4 hours 32 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 4 hours 32 minutes.<|im_end|>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many measuring spoons Jonathan has initially based on the information given about the relationship between measuring spoons and measuring cups.
2. Calculate the total number of measuring spoons and cups after receiving more spoons from Pedro.
3. Sum up all the utensils (measuring cups and spoons) Jonathan ends up with.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Determine initial number of measuring spoons**

We know that Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Let's denote the number of measuring cups as \( C \). Therefore,
\[ S = \frac{2}{3}C \]
where \( S \) represents the number of measuring spoons.

Since we don't have the exact number of measuring cups, let’s assume \( C \) to be an unknown variable representing the number of measuring cups.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of measuring spoons and cups after receiving more spoons**

Jonathan receives 6 more measuring spoons from Pedro. So, if he originally had \( S \) spoons, after receiving more spoons, he will have:
\[ S + 6 \]

Given that he already has \( C \) cups, the new total number of cups will be:
\[ C + 6 \]

Now, since \( S = \frac{2}{3}C \), the total number of utensils can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Utensils} = S + (C + 6) \]

Substitute \( S \):
\[ \text{Total Utensils} = \frac{2}{3}C + (C + 6) \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Total Utensils} = \frac{2}{3}C + C + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Utensils} = \left(\frac{2}{3} + 1\right)C + 6 \]
\[ \text{Total Utensils} = \frac{5}{3}C + 6 \]

### Final Answer:

After performing these calculations, it appears there was a mistake in the assumption or calculation regarding the number of cups. The correct approach should involve knowing the exact number of cups to accurately determine the number of spoons and then the total number of utensils. 

Let's re-evaluate the provided data assuming \( C = 24 \) (a common multiple of 3):

If \( C = 24 \):
\[ S = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \] 
So, initially, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons and 24 measuring cups.

After receiving 6 more spoons from Pedro:
\[ S' = 16 + 6 = 22 \]
And the total number of cups remains:
\[ C = 24 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils is:
\[ T = S' + C = 22 + 24 = 46 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 46 utensils.<|im_end|>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of occupied beds
- The hospital initially has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- Currently, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of these beds are occupied.

First, calculate the number of occupied beds:
\[
\text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, calculate the number of unoccupied beds:
\[
\text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of days for 2 weeks
Since one week has 7 days, two weeks have:
\[
2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the daily increase in unoccupied beds due to new admissions
- Each day, 50 more patients are admitted into the hospital.
- Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds increases by 50 per day.

### Step 4: Calculate the total increase in unoccupied beds over 14 days
Multiply the daily increase (50 beds/day) by the number of days (14):
\[
50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 5: Add the total increase to the initial number of unoccupied beds
Add the 700 additional unoccupied beds to the initial 800 unoccupied beds:
\[
800 + 700 = 1500 \text{ beds}
\]

### Conclusion:
After 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital will be **1500**.<|im_end|>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of non-work emails:**
   - Robyn sends 16 emails in total.
   - Seven of these are work emails.
   - Therefore, the number of non-work emails is \( 16 - 7 = 9 \).

2. **Determine the number of emails sent to her family:**
   - Two-thirds of the remaining emails (non-work) are sent to family.
   - The number of emails sent to family is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \).

3. **Calculate the number of emails sent to her boyfriend:**
   - There are three types of emails: work, family, and boyfriend.
   - We know that one-third of the remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend.
   - Since seven emails are work emails, the rest must be either family or boyfriend emails.
   - From step 2, we have already calculated that six emails are sent to family.
   - Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is \( 6 - (16 - 7) = 6 - 9 + 7 = 4 \).

So, Robyn sends 4 emails a day to her boyfriend.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 4.<|im_end|>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Courtney reported that there were 48 people.
   - Kelly claims Courtney has overestimated the number by 20%.

2. **Calculate the actual number based on Kelly's claim:**
   - Kelly says Courtney made an error of 20% too high.
   - Let \( x \) be the correct number of attendees.

3. **Set up the equation based on the percentage increase:**
   - The difference between what Courtney said (48) and what she actually was wrong about (x) should equal 20% of x.
     \[
     48 = x + 0.20x

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 1.20 to isolate \( x \):

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balls were in each person's bag initially, then calculate the total number of balls based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the relationships between the numbers:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of balls Jason picked up.
   - Let \( Z \) be the number of balls Jeffrey picked up.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of balls Jordan picked up.

2. **Given information about Jason’s contribution:**
   - According to the problem, if Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls, then:
     \[ A = 2 \]

3. **Calculate the total number of balls for Jason:**
   - Since Jason picks up and carries twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
     \[ A = 2Z \]
   - Substitute \( A = 2 \):
     \[ 2 = 2Z \]
     \[ Z = 1 \]
   - Therefore, Jeffrey picked up and carried 1 ball.

4. **Calculate the total number of balls for Jeffrey:**
   - Since Jeffrey picks up and carries twice as many balls as Jason:
     \[ Z = 2J \]
   - Substitute \( Z = 1 \):
     \[ 1 = 2J \]
     \[ J = \frac{1}{2} \]
   - Therefore, Jason picked up and carried 0.5 balls (half of a ball).

5. **Calculate the total number of balls for Jason:**
   - Since Jason picks up and carries twice as many balls as Jeffrey:
     \[ A = 2J \]
   - Substitute \( A = 2 \):
     \[ 2 = 2 \times 0.5 \]
   - Therefore, Jason picks up and carries 1 ball.

6. **Summarize the initial distribution of balls:**
   - Jeffery: 1 ball
   - Jason: 1 ball
   - Jordan: 2 balls (since it was given that Jason had picked up and carried 2 balls)

7. **Total number of balls initially distributed:**
   - Total balls = 1 (Jeffrey) + 1 (Jason) + 2 (Jordan)
   - Total balls = 4

8. **Final calculation after practice:**
   - Coach dumps all the balls out onto the gym floor.
   - Coach asks Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey to pick up and carry all the balls over to the bag.
   - Jordan picks up and carries 2 balls.
   - Jason picks up and carries 2 balls.
   - Jeffrey picks up and carries 1 ball.

9. **Total number of balls collected:**
   - Total balls = 2 (Jordan) + 2 (Jason) + 1 (Jeffrey)

                    question:
                    A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. ; They stopped digging , early on the third day to fill in two ! holes the pirates kept falling in.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug after three days:**
   - Day 1: 10 holes
   - Day 2: 13 holes
   - Day 3: 8 holes (after filling in 2)

   Total after 3 days = \( 10 + 13 + 8 \) = 31 holes.

2. **Determine how many more holes were dug on the fourth day than on the third day:**
   - Pirates found a treasure chest on the fourth day.
   - We know that there were four times as many holes on the fourth day as at the end of the first day.

   Let's denote the number of holes dug on the fourth day as \( x \).

   According to the information given:
   \[
   x = 4 \times (\text{number of holes at the end of the first day})
   \]

   Since we don't have the exact number of holes at the end of the first day, let’s assume that the number of holes at the end of the first day was \( H \). Therefore:
   \[
   x = 4H
   \]

   Now, since the pirates dug 8 holes on the third day and found a treasure chest, the number of holes dug on the fourth day must be greater than or equal to 8 (because they couldn’t find a treasure chest if fewer than 8 holes were dug):

   \[
   x \geq 8
   \]

   Given \( x = 4H \), we can deduce that:
   \[
   4H \geq 8
   \]
   
   Dividing both sides by 4 gives us:
   \[
   H \geq 2
   \]

   So, the minimum number of holes dug on the fourth day would be 8. 

3. **Verify the calculation and conclusion:**

   If the pirates dug exactly 8 holes on the fourth day, then they indeed found the treasure chest because it was inside the hat they filled up.

Therefore, the pirates dug 8 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. 

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{8}
\]<|im_end|>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.
They dug 10 + 13 + 8 = <<10+13+8=31>>31 holes the first three days.
After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips in the bag. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine who gets extra corn chips.
- According to the problem, the second person (Collins) receives 15 more corn chips than the others.
- The first person (Amora) and the third person (Lainey) both received 70 corn chips each.

Since Collins receives 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey, let's denote the number of corn chips that Amora and Lainey each have as \( A \) and \( L \), respectively. We know \( A = 70 \) and \( L = 70 \).

Therefore, the number of corn chips Collins has is:
\[ C = A + 15 = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of corn chips.
Now, we add up all the corn chips:
- Amora has 70 corn chips,
- Lainey has 70 corn chips,
- Collins has 85 corn chips,

So, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \text{Total} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 225 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much travel costs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the ticket cost:**
   - The ticket cost is 50% more than the supplies.
   - Supplies cost $400.

   Let's denote the ticket price as \( T \).

   Since the ticket cost is 50% more than the supplies, we can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   T = 400 + 0.5 \times 400
   \]

2. **Perform the calculation:**
   \[
   T = 400 + 0.5 \times 400
   \]
   \[
   T = 400 + 200
   \]
   \[
   T = 600
   \]

So, the ticket cost is $600.

3. **Calculate the total travel cost:**
   - Travel cost includes both the ticket and the supply costs.

   Let's denote the total travel cost as \( TC \).

   We know that the ticket cost (which is $600) is part of the total travel cost, so:
   \[
   TC = 600 + \text{supply cost}
   \]

   Given that the supplies cost $400, we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   TC = 600 + 400
   \]
   \[
   TC = 1000
   \]

Therefore, the total travel cost is $1000.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided and then solve those equations.

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, Adelwolde, and ! (who seems like it should be Stan) as A, S, AD, and ! respectively.

Given:
1. Alex has caught 5 Pokémon.
2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokémon as Adelwolde.
4. Together they have caught 339 Pokémon in total.

First, let's express these conditions mathematically:

1. \(A = 5\)
2. \(A = S + 5\) or equivalently \(S = A - 5\)
3. \(S = \frac{AD}{4} - 13\)

Now, since Alex, Stan, Adelwolde, and ! have together caught 339 Pokémon, we can write the equation for their combined total:

\[A + S + AD + ! = 339\]

Substitute \(A = 5\) into the above equation:

\[5 + S + AD + ! = 339\]
\[S + AD + ! = 334\]

Next, substitute \(S = A - 5\) into the equation:

\[A - 5 + AD + ! = 334\]
\[5 - 5 + AD + ! = 334\]
\[AD + ! = 330\]

Now we know \(AD + ! = 330\).

Since \(S = A - 5\) and \(A = 5\), we get:

\[S = 5 - 5\]
\[S = 0\]

But this doesn't make sense because if Stan hasn't caught any Pokémon, how could he possibly have caught more than Alex? Let's correct our approach here: instead of assuming Stan has caught no Pokémon, we'll consider the relationship between Stan's and Adelwolde's catches directly.

From \(S = AD - 18\) (since \(AD - 13 = S\)), and knowing \(AD + ! = 330\):

If Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times Adelwolde's catch, we can write:

\[S = AD - 13\]

And since \(AD + ! = 330\), we can find out how much Adelwolde has caught first:

\[AD + (! + AD - 13) = 330\]
\[2AD + ! - 13 = 330\]
\[2AD + ! = 343\]

Now, if Stan has caught \(AD - 13\) Pokémon, and Adelwolde has caught \(AD\) Pokémon, then:

\[AD - 13 + AD = 339\]
\[2AD = 352\]
\[AD = 176\]

So, Adelwolde has caught 176 Pokémon.

Therefore, Stan has caught \(176 - 13 = 163\) Pokémon.

Thus, the final answer is:
The final answer is: **Stan has caught 163 Pokémon**.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many episodes John will watch.
2. Calculate the total time spent watching these episodes.

### Step 1: Determine the number of episodes

- Each episode is 20 minutes long.
- There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

First, let's calculate the number of episodes based on the given information:
- Let \( E \) represent the number of episodes.
- We know that each episode is 20 minutes long, so \( E = \frac{M}{2} \), where \( M \) is the total number of minutes per episode.

Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can set up the equation:
\[ M = 20E \]

Now, since there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we have:
\[ M = \frac{M}{2} \times 2 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ M = 40 \text{ (minutes)} \]

So, John will watch all episodes because the total number of minutes matches the duration of each episode.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time spent watching the show

- Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 40 minutes in total, the total time spent watching the show is:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 40 \text{ minutes/episode} \times 40 \text{ episodes} \]

Calculating this gives us:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 1600 \text{ minutes} \]

### Conclusion

John will spend **1600 minutes** watching the show if he watches every episode.<|im_end|>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance traveled by the bird during its journey from its northern home to its southern home. Let's break down the journey into three parts:

### Part 1: Flying South for 10 Hours at 30 Miles Per Hour
1. **Calculate the distance covered in this part:**
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 300 \, \text{miles}
   \]

### Part 2: Turning Direction and Flying North for 2 Hours at 18 Miles Per Hour
2. **Determine the remaining distance to fly after turning back:**
   - The total distance from the starting point (north) to the end point (south) is \(300\) miles.
   - Subtract the distance already flown (300 miles) from the total distance:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance}_1 = 300 \, \text{miles} - 300 \, \text{miles} = 0 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   
   Since the bird has already reached the southern home, it does not have any further flight to complete the journey.

### Conclusion
Given that the bird has completed its journey as described, there is no remaining distance left to cover. Therefore, the total distance between the bird’s northern and southern homes is zero miles.

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many brownies Greta originally made for herself.
Greta made 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.

### Step 2: Calculate how many brownies were thrown at her office party.
At her office, they threw her a party and sent her home with half a dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen = 12, then half a dozen is 6 brownies.

### Step 3: Determine how many brownies Greta has when she arrives home.
When she arrived home, her friends were there to throw her a surprise party and had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.

### Step 4: Calculate how many brownies were eaten during the party.
During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.

### Step 5: Calculate how many brownies are left after the party.

Now subtract the 18 brownies that were eaten from the total number of brownies available at her arrival home: 
\[ 4 \text{ dozen} - 18 \text{ brownies} = 0 \text{ brownies remaining} \]

Since all 18 brownies were eaten during the party, there are no brownies left for Greta after the party.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we first need to calculate the total time required for each type of stringing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the time for each type of stringing.
- **Synthetic Gut Strings**:
  - Time per racquet = 15 minutes
  - Number of racquets = 3
  - Total time for synthetic gut strings = \( 3 \times 15 \) minutes = 45 minutes

- **Polyester Strings**:
  - Time per racquet = 22 minutes
  - Number of racquets = 5
  - Total time for polyester strings = \( 5 \times 22 \) minutes = 110 minutes

- **Hybrid Sets**:
  - Time per racquet = 18 minutes
  - Number of racquets = 4
  - Total time for hybrid sets = \( 4 \times 18 \) minutes = 72 minutes

#### Step 2: Sum up the total time.
- Total time for synthetic gut strings = 45 minutes
- Total time for polyester strings = 110 minutes
- Total time for hybrid sets = 72 minutes

Total time to string all the racquets = \( 45 + 110 + 72 \) minutes = 227 minutes

#### Step 3: Convert the total time into hours.
- 227 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 3.783 hours

### Conclusion:
It will take Andy approximately 3.783 hours to string all the racquets.

{The final answer is} 3.783 hours.<|im_end|>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.
He is stringing 5 racquets with polyester string, so those will take 5 polyester string jobs * 22 minutes per polyester string job = <<5*22=110>>110 minutes.
He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.

                    question:
                    John ! decides ; to , buy , new ! phones ? for him, his 2 : kids, and his wife.  ? Each phone after the first 2 , is : half price. ,  If the ? phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of people buying the phones.
John is purchasing phones for himself (one person), his two children (two people total), and his wife (one person). Therefore, there are a total of **4** people who will be receiving these phones.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the initial phones.
Since the first two phones are not discounted, their combined cost would be calculated at full price. Let's assume the full price of one phone is $P$.

- Cost of the first phone = $P$
- Cost of the second phone = $P$

So, the total cost for the first two phones is:
\[ P + P = 2P \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the remaining phones.
After the first two phones, the rest of the phones are sold at half price. Let's assume that the number of additional phones purchased beyond the first two is denoted as \( n \).

- Cost of each subsequent phone (from the third onwards) = $\frac{P}{2}$

Thus, the cost for the next \( n \) phones would be:
\[ n \times \frac{P}{2} \]

Given in the problem statement, if the price of the fourth phone is $600, then:
\[ \frac{P}{2} = 600 \]
Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = 600 \times 2 \]
\[ P = 1200 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

### Step 4: Sum up the costs for all the phones.
Total cost can be represented as:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2P + n \times \frac{P}{2} \]

Substitute \( P = 1200 \):
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2(1200) + n \times \frac{1200}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2400 + n \times 600 \]

### Step 5: Substitute the value of \( n \).
If the total number of phones bought is given as \( N \), where \( N \geq 4 \):

\[ N = 2 + 2 + 2 + n = 6 + n \]

Therefore, the total cost becomes:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2400 + n \times 600 \]

Given that the total number of phones bought is 8 (as per the problem statement):
\[ N = 8 \]

So,
\[ 8 = 6 + n \]
Solve for \( n \):
\[ n = 8 - 6 \]
\[ n = 2 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost.
Finally, substitute \( n = 2 \) back into the equation:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2400 + 2 \times 600 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2400 + 1200 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 3600 \]

### Conclusion:
John paid a total of **$3600** for the phones.<|im_end|>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones
2 of the phones cost 600 so their cost is 2*600=$<<2*600=1200>>1200
The other two phones cost 600/2=$<<600/2=300>>300
So they cost 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600
So the total cost is 1200+600=$<<1200+600=1800>>1800

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of players on Zeke's team.
- We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team.
- Carlton's team has 13 players.

Let \( C \) represent the number of players on Carlton's team. According to the information given:
\[ C = 13 \]

Now we can find the number of players on Zeke's team (\( Z \)):
\[ Z = C + 7 \]
Substituting \( C \):
\[ Z = 13 + 7 \]
\[ Z = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of players on both teams combined.
We already have the number of players for each team:
- Carlton's team: 13 players
- Zeke's team: 20 players

Adding these together gives us the total number of players:
\[ Total\ Players = C + Z \]
\[ Total\ Players = 13 + 20 \]
\[ Total\ Players = 33 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 33 players.<|im_end|>","If Carlton's team has 13 players, Zeke's team has 7 players + 13 players = 20 players.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence**

Given that the dimensions of the fence are 15 feet (length) and 10 feet (width), we can calculate the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)
           = 2 * (15 + 10)
           = 2 * 25
           = 50 feet

So, the total length of the fence is 50 feet.

**Step 2: Determine how many wood slats are needed per foot of fencing**

According to the information provided, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of wood slats required**

Now, multiply the total length of the fence (50 feet) by the number of wood slats needed per foot.

Total Wood Slats Needed = Perimeter × Number of Wood Slats per Foot
                         = 50 feet × 2
                         = 100 wood slats

Therefore, Robert will need **100 wood slats** to build the 15-foot-long, 10-foot-wide rectangular wooden fence around his garden.<|im_end|>","A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially has.
Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes.

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes she gives to her mom and sister.
She gives 2 boxes to each of her mom and sister, so that's 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of boxes after giving some away.
Subtract the 4 boxes given away from the initial 12 boxes:
12 - 4 = 8 boxes remaining.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of oranges in these remaining boxes.
Each box contains 20 oranges, so for 8 boxes, there are:
8 * 20 = 160 oranges.

### Step 5: Find out what fraction of the oranges Mrs. Harrington keeps.
She keeps 1/4 of the oranges, so she keeps:
(1/4) * 160 = 40 oranges.

### Step 6: Calculate how many oranges she sells.
Subtract the number of oranges she keeps from the total number of oranges:
160 - 40 = 120 oranges.

### Final Answer:
Mrs. Harrington sold **120 oranges**.<|im_end|>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.

So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of states in India:**
   - India has 28 states.

2. **Calculate half the number of states in India:**
   - Half of 28 is \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).

3. **Add 4 to half the number of states in India:**
   - This gives us \( 14 + 4 = 18 \).

So, India has 18 more states than half the number of states in the USA.

4. **Find out how many states there are in the USA:**
   - Since India has 18 more states than half the number of states in the USA, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18 = \frac{x}{2}
     \]
     where \( x \) represents the total number of states in the USA.
   
5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     18 \times 2 = x
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is **36**.<|im_end|>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25

To determine how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cherries Richard has.
Given that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard, we can set up an equation to find out how many cherries Richard has.

Let \( R \) represent the number of cherries Richard has.

From the information provided:
\[ R + 10 = 30 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ R = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cherries available for sharing.
We know there are 60 cherries in total.

### Step 3: Determine the number of cherries left after sharing.
Since all cherries are shared equally among Richard, Jerry, and Robert, we divide the total number of cherries by 3.

Total cherries per person:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Each person gets 20 cherries.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of cherries remaining after distribution.
Robert initially had 30 cherries, but since only 20 are distributed, he will have:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \] cherries left.

Jerry also receives 20 cherries.

### Step 5: Find the difference between the number of cherries Robert and Jerry have.
Robert has 10 cherries left, while Jerry received 20 cherries.

Difference in the number of cherries:
\[ 10 - 20 = -10 \]

This negative value indicates that Jerry actually has 10 more cherries than Robert.

Therefore, **Robert has 10 fewer** cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:

\[

To determine Sunny's earnings over the two days, we need to calculate the number of pies and cakes sold each day, then multiply these numbers by their respective costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pies and cakes sold on Saturday**

- **Saturday Gingerbread:** Given as 10 boxes.
- **Saturday Apple Pie:** Given as 4 fewer boxes than the number of gingerbreads sold, which means \(10 - 4 = 6\) boxes.

So, on Saturday:
- Number of gingerbread sold = 10 boxes at $6 per box = \(10 \times 6 = \$60\).
- Number of apple pie sold = 6 boxes at $15 per box = \(6 \times 15 = \$90\).

Total earnings from Saturday = \(\$60 + \$90 = \$150\).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pies and cakes sold on Sunday**

- **Sunday Gingerbread:** Given as 5 more boxes than on Saturday, which means \(10 + 5 = 15\) boxes.
- **Sunday Apple Pie:** Given as 15 boxes.

So, on Sunday:
- Number of gingerbread sold = 15 boxes at $6 per box = \(15 \times 6 = \$90\).
- Number of apple pie sold = 15 boxes at $15 per box = \(15 \times 15 = \$225\).

Total earnings from Sunday = \(\$90 + \$225 = \$315\).

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings over the two days**

Total earnings (both days) = Earnings from Saturday + Earnings from Sunday = \(\$150 + \$315 = \$465\).

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of \(\boxed{465}\) dollars over the two days.<|im_end|>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
   - The price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Calculate the cost of the red car relative to the blue car:**
   - Since the red car is 40% cheaper, we need to find 60% (which is 100% - 40%) of the blue car's price.

3. **Perform the calculation for the red car’s price:**
   \[
   \text{Red car price} = \text{Blue car price} \times (1 - \text{Discount})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Red car price} = \$100 \times (1 - 0.4) = \$100 \times 0.6 = \$60
   \]

4. **Verify the logic using percentages:**
   - The discount on the blue car should be applied to its original value.
   - Therefore, the blue car price minus the discount equals the red car price.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both cars now have their prices calculated correctly based on the provided information.

Therefore, both cars' costs are as follows:
- Blue car: $100
- Red car: $60

Hence, both cars cost:
\[
\boxed{\$100 \text{ (blue)}, \$60 \text{ (red)}}
\]<|im_end|>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.

So both cars cost 100 + 60 = $<<100+60=160>>160.

                    question:
                    . Emil is 19 years , old now. When he . turns 24, he : will be half the . age of his dad but twice as old as his brother. ,  . What is the sum of . the ; ages ? of his ; dad ; and his : brother now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's father and brother based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( E \) represent Emil's current age.
Let \( D \) represent the father's current age.
Let \( B \) represent the brother's current age.

Given that Emil is currently 19 years old, we have:
\[ E = 19 \]

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement
According to the problem, when Emil turns 24 (i.e., after 5 years), he will be half the age of his father and twice as old as his brother.

- After 5 years, Emil’s age will be \( E + 5 \).
- At that time, his father’s age will be \( D + 5 \). According to the problem, this should equal twice Emil’s age at that time:
\[ D + 5 = 2(E + 5) \]
Substituting \( E = 19 \):
\[ D + 5 = 2(19 + 5) \]
\[ D + 5 = 2 \times 24 \]
\[ D + 5 = 48 \]
\[ D = 43 \]

- At that same time, Emil’s brother's age should be half of his father’s age:
\[ B + 5 \]
This should equal one-half of Emil’s age at that time:
\[ B + 5 = \frac{E}{2} \]
Substituting \( E = 19 \):
\[ B + 5 = \frac{19}{2} \]
\[ B + 5 = 9.5 \]
\[ B = 4.5 \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
Now let's verify if these values satisfy all conditions:

- Emil’s age in 5 years: \( 19 + 5 = 24 \)
- Father’s age in 5 years: \( 43 + 5 = 48 \)
- Brother’s age in 5 years: \( 4.5 + 5 = 9.5 \)

- Twice Emil’s age in 5 years: \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \)
- Half of Emil’s age in 5 years: \( \frac{24}{2} = 12 \)
  
These calculations confirm that Emil will indeed be half the age of his father and twice the age of his brother when he turns 24.

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of Ages
Summing up their ages now:
\[ E + D + B = 19 + 43 + 4.5 \]
\[ = 66.5 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of Emil, his father, and his brother now is:
\[
\boxed{66.5}
\]<|im_end|>","His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.
His brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.
Emil will turn 24 in 24 - 19 = <<24-19=5>>5 years.
The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

To determine how many beads Adrianne has in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of beads given by her mother:**
   - Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

2. **Determine the number of beads given by her sister:**
   - Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
     \[
     \text{Number of beads from sister} = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of beads given by her friend:**
   - Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.
     \[
     \text{Number of beads from friend} = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

4. **Sum up all the beads received:**
   - Add the beads from her mother, her sister, and her friend.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount Joe caught on Friday**
- Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount.

\[
\text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount Joe caught on Saturday**
- On Friday, Joe caught 12 pounds of crawfish.
- On Saturday, he caught half as much as he did on Friday.

\[
\text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount Joe caught over the three days**
- Total amount = Thursday + Friday + Saturday

\[
\text{Total amount} = 3 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} + 6 \text{ (Saturday)}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total amount into servings**
- Each serving is 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Amount per serving}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of servings} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

Therefore, Joe has **7 servings** of crawfish.<|im_end|>","He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of football players:**
   - There are 30 students in total.
   - 20% of the class are football players.
   \[
   \text{Number of football players} = 0.20 \times 30 = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students who are not football players:**
   \[
   \text{Students not playing football} = 30 - 6 = 24

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Calculate the total size of their shoes combined.
3. Find the average size of their shoes.

Step 1: Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
- We know that Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's boots.
- Sophie's boots size is given as 5 (in whatever unit they use).
- Therefore, Charlie's boots size = 5 * Sophie's boot size
= 5 * 5
= 25

Step 2: Calculate the total size of their shoes combined.
- The total size is the sum of both people's sizes.
- Charlie's boots + Sophie's boots = 25 + 5 = 30

Step 3: Find the average size of their shoes.
- To find the average, divide the total size by the number of people.
- Total size divided by 2 (since there are two people) = 30 / 2 = 15

Therefore, the average size of their shoes is 15.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of plants needed for the flower bed, then calculate the cost based on the given price per plant.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Number of Plants Needed
1. **Convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches**:
   - 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Length of the flower bed = 111 feet.
   - Total length in inches = \( 111 \times 12 \) inches = 1332 inches.

2. **Determine the spacing required between the plants**:
   - The distance between each plant should be 1.5 feet (or 18 inches).

3. **Calculate the number of gaps needed**:
   - There must be one gap between each pair of plants.
   - Number of gaps = Total length / Gap width.
   - Number of gaps = \( \frac{1332}{18} \) = 73.44... ≈ 73 gaps (since you can't have a fraction of a gap).

4. **Add one more gap for the starting point**:
   - Since there is no gap at the beginning of the flower bed, add an extra gap.
   - Total number of gaps = 74.

5. **Divide the total number of gaps by two to find the number of plants**:
   - Number of plants = \( \frac{74}{2} \) = 37.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of the Plants
1. **Determine the total number of plants needed**:
   - We calculated that 37 plants are needed.

2. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - Each plant costs $6.
   - Total cost = Number of plants × Price per plant.
   - Total cost = \( 37 \times 6 \) = $222.

### Final Answer:
Pat will spend $222 at the store to fill up her flower bed.<|im_end|>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total amount of soil needed:**
   - Soil per rose: 1 pound
   - Soil per carnation: 1.5 pounds
   - Soil per sunflower: 3 pounds

2. **Calculate the total number of roses that can be planted based on the available soil:**
   - Since we have enough soil for all the other plants (sunflowers and carnations), we'll focus on the roses.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of roses.

3. **Set up an equation to find out how much soil is used for the roses:**
   - The total soil required for roses will be \( R \times 1 \) pound (since each rose needs 1 pound).

4. **Consider the remaining soil after planting the sunflowers and carnations:**
   - Total soil initially: 30 pounds
   - Soil used for sunflowers: \( 4 \times 3 \) pounds = 12 pounds
   - Soil used for carnations: \( 10 \times 1.5 \) pounds = 15 pounds

5. **Subtract the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the initial total soil:**
   - Remaining soil: \( 30 - 12 - 15 \)

6. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Remaining soil: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) pounds

7. **Determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil:**
   - Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted is equal to the remaining soil.

Therefore, the number of roses that can be planted is \( 3 \).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 3.<|im_end|>","They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12
They used 15 pounds on carnations because 10 x 1.5 = <<10*1.5=15>>15
They have used 27 pounds in total because 12 + 15 = <<12+15=27>>27
They have 30 pounds left because 30 - 27 = <<30-27=3>>3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Jessica's monthly savings**

Jessica saves 25% of her monthly income for fancy shoes.

- Monthly income = $2,000.00
- Savings rate = 25%

First, calculate 25% of her monthly income:

\[ \text{Monthly savings} = \text{Monthly income} \times \text{Savings rate} \]

\[
= \$2,000.00 \times 0.25
\]
\[
= \$500.00
\]

So, Jessica saves $500.00 per month for fancy shoes.

**Step 2: Determine how much Jessica spends on shoes annually**

Now that we know how much Jessica saves every month, we need to find out how much she spends on shoes over an entire year.

- Annual savings (from Step 1) = $500.00/month × 12 months/year

\[
= \$6,000.00/year
\]

So, Jessica saves $6,000.00 annually from saving her money.

**Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes Jessica can afford**

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

- Cost of one shoe = $1,000.00
- Total saved annually = $6,000.00
- Number of pairs of shoes = Total saved / Cost per pair

\[
= \frac{\$6,000.00}{\$1,000.00}
\]
\[
= 6
\]

Therefore, Jessica can buy **6 pairs of shoes** in a year.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{6}\).<|im_end|>","She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00

                    question:
                    ; Emily , can peel 6 shrimp ? a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 , minutes. How long . will ; it take her to ; peel and cook : 90 shrimp?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Emily to both peel and cook 90 shrimp. We know that she can peel 6 shrimp per minute and sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the time needed to peel 90 shrimp:**
   - Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we divide the total number of shrimp (90) by the rate at which she peels them.
     \[
     \text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time needed to sauté 90 shrimp:**
   - We already know from the given information that it takes her 10 minutes to sauté 30 shrimp.
   - To find out how many times she needs to perform this task, we divide the total number of shrimp (90) by the number of shrimp she can sauté per session (30).
     \[
     \text{Number of sautés required} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/session}} = 3 \text{ sessions}
     \]
   - Each session takes 10 minutes, so for 3 sessions:
     \[
     \text{Total time to sauté} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Add up the total time:**
   - The total time includes both the peeling time and the sautéing time.
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Total time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Emily **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.<|im_end|>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the situation into steps:

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   Let's assume the initial temperature of the room is \( T \) degrees.

2. **Cooling Process:**
   - For the first 3 hours, the air conditioner operates at low setting.
     \[
     \text{Temperature after 3 hours (low)} = T - 2 \times 3 = T - 6
     \]
   
   - For the next 4 hours, the air conditioner operates at high setting.
     \[
     \text{Temperature after 7 hours (high)} = (T - 6) - 3 \times 4 = (T - 6) - 12 = T - 18
     \]

3. **No Air Conditioner Running Period:**
   - For the last 2 hours, the air conditioner is off.
     \[
     \text{Temperature after 9 hours} = (T - 18)
     \]

4. **Final Temperature Calculation:**
   - The final temperature after all these operations can be represented as:
     \[
     \text{Final Temperature} = T - 18
     \]

5. **Finding the Difference from Initial Temperature:**
   - To find how many degrees lower the final temperature is compared to the initial temperature, we subtract the final temperature from the initial temperature:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = T - (T - 18) = 18
     \]

Therefore, the final temperature is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature. 

{The final answer is}
-18<|im_end|>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

                    Comet Halley , orbits the sun every 75 years. Bill's dad saw the Comet when he ! was 30 years old. Bill saw ? the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine Bill's age at which he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Dad's Age When Bill Saw the First Time:**
   - Dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - The comet takes 75 years to orbit the sun.

2. **Calculate Total Years from Now Until the Second Appearance:**
   - Since the comet returns after 75 years, there will be two appearances in total (one now and one in the future).
   - Therefore, the total time until the next appearance (after Bill's second appearance) is 75 years.

3. **Find the Time Interval Between the Two Comets:**
   - Subtract the interval between Bill's two sightings from the total time before the next appearance.
     \[
     \text{Time interval} = 75 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate Bill's Current Age:**
   - We know that Bill's current age is three times his father's age when he saw the comet.
   - Dad's age when Bill saw the comet for the first time is 30 years.
   - Thus, if Bill's current age is \( B \), then:
     \[
     B = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years}
     \]

5. **Calculate Bill's Age at the Second Comet Appearance:**
   - Bill sees the comet again when he is three times as old as his father was when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - Dad's age when Bill saw the comet for the first time is 30 years.
   - So, Bill's age at the second appearance is:
     \[
     B + (B/3) = 90 + (90/3) = 90 + 30 = 120 \text{ years}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Number of Years Since the First Appearance:**
   - The number of years since the first appearance can be calculated by subtracting the initial age from Bill's current age.
     \[
     \text{Years since first appearance} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ years}
     \]

7. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The total time before the second appearance should equal the number of years since the first appearance plus the initial interval (which is 75 years):
     \[
     30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years}
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are correct.

Therefore, Bill was born 60 years ago. His age when he saw the comet for the first time is 90 years.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is: 90<|im_end|>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.
Comet Halley can be seen every 75 years, so Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 years - 75 years = <<90-75=15>>15 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many checks Buford writes in a year, we need to consider all his monthly, bi-monthly, and quarterly payments.

1. **Monthly Checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for electricity.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(1 \times 12 = 12\) checks annually from the electric bill.

2. **Bi-Monthly Checks (Gas Bill):**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - Since there are two gas bills written per month, he writes \(2 \times 6 = 12\) checks annually from the gas bill.

3. **Quarterly Checks (Church Donations):**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the church.
   - There are four quarters in a year, so he writes \(4 \times 4 = 16\) checks annually from the church donations.

4. **Bi-Weekly Checks (Pest & Lawn Service):**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter to the pest and lawn service.
   - Since there are four quarters in a year, he writes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) checks annually from the pest and lawn service.

Now, let's sum up all these checks:

\[
12 (\text{electric}) + 12 (\text{gas}) + 16 (\text{church}) + 8 (\text{lawn service})
\]

Adding them together gives us:

\[
12 + 12 + 16 + 8 = 50
\]

Therefore, Buford writes a total of 50 checks per year. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 50.<|im_end|>","Once per month he writes a check to pay the electric bill, or 1*12=<<1*12=12>>12 checks each year.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flights to France the first plane takes on a single day.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of flights to France.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of flights to Germany.
   - Let \( P \) represent the number of flights to Poland.

2. **Determine Flights to Greece from the First Plane:**
   - The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
   - Therefore, the number of flights to Greece = \( \frac{3}{4} \times (P + F + G) \).

3. **Calculate Remaining Flights:**
   - Subtract the flights to Greece from the total flights to find the remaining flights.
   - Total flights = \( P + F + G \).
   - Remaining flights = \( P + F + G - \frac{3}{4}(P + F + G) \).

4. **Split the Remaining Flights Equally Between France and Germany:**
   - Since the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany,
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( P + F + G - \frac{3}{4}(P + F + G) \right)
     \]

5. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}(P + F + G) = \frac{3(P + F + G)}{4}
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( P + F + G - \frac{3(P + F + G)}{4} \right)
     \]

6. **Combine Terms:**
   - Distribute the fraction within the parentheses:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{4P + 4F + 4G - 3P - 3F - 3G}{4} \right)
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{P + F + G}{4} \right)
     \]

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{P + F + G}{8}
     \]

Given that the second plane makes exactly half the number of trips as the first plane, we can denote their total trips as follows:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the total trips made by the first plane.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the total trips made by the second plane.

Since the second plane makes 44 trips which is half the number of trips made by the first plane:
\[
T_2 = \frac{T_1}{2}
\]

Substitute \( T_2 \) into the equation:
\[
44 = \frac{T_1}{2}
\]

Solve for \( T_1 \):
\[
T_1 = 44 \times 2 = 88
\]

Now substitute \( T_1 \) back into the expression for the flights to France:
\[
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{P + F + G}{8}
\]

We know the total number of flights is \( T_1 \), so:
\[
88 = P + F + G
\]

Thus, substituting \( P + F + G = 88 \) into the equation for the flights to France:
\[
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{88}{8} = 11
\]

Therefore, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.<|im_end|>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined length of time that Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous howl together.

1. **Determine how long Tobias's howl lasts:**
   - Tobias’s howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Calculate how long Chikote’s howl lasts:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration = \(2 \times 20\) seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Calculate how long Igneous’ howl lasts:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the combined howl times of Tobias and Chikote.
   - Combined howl time of Tobias and Chikote = \(20 + 40\) seconds = 60 seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration = 60 seconds.

4. **Sum up the total howl durations of all three wolves:**
   - Total howl duration = \(20 + 40 + 60\) seconds = 120 seconds.

5. **Convert the total howl duration from seconds to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we divide the total number of seconds by 60.
   - Therefore, \(120 \div 60\) minutes = 2 minutes.

### Conclusion:
The combined length of time (in minutes) of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 2 minutes.<|im_end|>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.

                    question:
                    Adam bought himself some new trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6 for this purpose, and his . father gave him twice as much. How much money did Adam have to contribute from his savings?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount given:**
   - Adam's mother gave him $6.
   - Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother.

2. **Calculate the amount given by Adam's father:**
   - Father's contribution = 2 * Mother's contribution
   - Father's contribution = 2 * $6 = $12

3. **Sum up all contributions:**
   - Total amount given = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
   - Total amount given = $6 (Mother) + $12 (Father)

4. **Determine the remaining cost after receiving gifts:**
   - Cost of trousers = $30
   - Remaining cost after gifts = Cost of trousers - Total amount given

5. **Subtract the total amount given from the remaining cost:**
   - Contribution from savings = Remaining cost after gifts - Total amount given

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

1. **Total amount given:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount given} = \$6 (\text{mother}) + \$12 (\text{father}) = \$18
   \]

2. **Remaining cost after gifts:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining cost} = \$30 (\text{cost of trousers}) - \$18 (\text{total amount given}) = \$12
   \]

3. **Contribution from savings:**
   \[
   \text{Contribution from savings} = \$12 (\text{remaining cost}) - \$18 (\text{total amount given})
   \]
   Since it doesn't make sense for Adam to owe more than he has in savings, let's re-evaluate if there was an error in interpretation or calculation.

Given that Adam's father contributed exactly what was needed to cover the remainder, let's correct our approach:

1. **Corrected contribution from father:**
   - Correct Father's contribution = $6 (as given)
   
2. **Revised total amount given:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount given} = \$6 (\text{mother}) + \$6 (\text{father}) = \$12
   \]

3. **Revised remaining cost after gifts:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining cost} = \$30 (\text{cost of trousers}) - \$12 (\text{total amount given}) = \$18
   \]

4. **Revised contribution from savings:**
   \[
   \text{Contribution from savings} = \$18 (\text{total amount given}) - \$12 (\text{total amount given})
   \]
   This results in:
   \[
   \text{Contribution from savings} = \$6
   \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $6 from his savings. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]<|im_end|>","Adam's father gave him $6 * 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the average age of the group:**
   - The total age of all four children is given as 20 years.
   - There are four children in the group.

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ years}
\]

2. **Use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age to find her age:**
   - According to the problem, Helene is twice as old as the average age.

\[
\text{Helene's age} = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ years}
\]

3. **Subtract the ages of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age to find Wilfred's age:**

\[
\text{Wilfred's age} = \text{Total age} - (\text{Akbar's age} + \text{Alessandro's age})
\]
\[
\text{Wilfred's age} = 20 - (3 + 4) = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{13} \).<|im_end|>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.

The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Collection**:
   - Walter first collects $500 from his neighbors.
   
2. **Online Fund Collection**:
   - He then collects an additional $1500 from his online fundraiser.

3. **Lawyer's Contribution**:
   - The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as what anyone else has donated.

4. **Total Amount Donated So Far**:
   - After receiving contributions from his neighbors ($500) and the online fund ($1500), Walter will have a total of $2000 (since $500 + $1500 = $2000).

5. **Lawyer's Contribution Calculation**:
   - According to the problem, the lawyer will donate three times the amount that anyone else has contributed.
   - Let's denote the amount donated by Walter's neighbors as \(N\). We know \(N = 500\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the lawyer's contribution will be \(3 \times N\).
   - Substituting \(N = 500\):
     \[
     \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Adding the Lawyer's Contribution to Total**:
   - Walter initially collected $2000 from his neighbors and received $200 from his friend.
   - Adding the lawyer's contribution of $1500:
     \[
     \text{Final total} = 2000 + 200 + 1500 = 3700 \text{ dollars}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate total number of cookies:**
   - There were 100 guests at the wedding.
   - Each guest brought a plate containing 15 cookies.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\).

2. **Determine half of the cookies given to the church:**
   - The bride gave half of the cookies to the church.
   - Half of 1500 cookies is \(1500 / 2 = 750\) cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of people who received cookies from the church:**
   - Each person in the church received 15 cookies.
   - To find out how many people received 15 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies (which went to the church) by the number of cookies per person.
   - So, the number of people in the church is \(750 \div 15 = 50\).

Therefore, the final answer is: **50**.<|im_end|>","If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    A family of 6 (2 : adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a , slice that is : twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the size of one kid's slice.
   - Since each adult's slice is twice as big as a kid's slice, an adult's slice will be \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - There are 2 adults and 4 kids in the family.
   - Total number of slices = Number of adults + Number of kids = 2 + 4 = 6.

3. **Determine the total volume of the watermelon based on the slices:**
   - Each slice represents the same volume of the watermelon.
   - If the sum of all slices equals the whole watermelon, then the total volume of the watermelon can be represented as the sum of all slices' volumes.

4. **Express the total volume in terms of \( x \):**
   - The total volume of the watermelon is equal to the sum of the volumes of the slices.
   - Volume of the watermelon = \( 2x \times \text{Number of adults} + 4x \times \text{Number of kids} \)
     \[
     \text{Volume of the watermelon} = 2x \times 2 + 4x \times 4 = 4x + 16x = 20x
     \]

5. **Determine the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - An adult's share of the watermelon is proportional to their number of slices.
   - Adult's share = Fraction of watermelon × Total volume of watermelon
   \[
   \text{Adult's share} = \frac{\text{Number of adults}}{\text{Total number of slices}} \times \text{Total volume of watermelon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Adult's share} = \frac{2}{6} \times 20x = \frac{1}{3} \times 20x = \frac{20x}{3}
   \]

6. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**
   - To find the percentage, multiply the fraction by 100.
   \[
   \text{Percentage of the watermelon each adult gets} = \left( \frac{20x}{3} \right) \times 100\%
   \]
   Simplify this expression:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20x}{3} \times 100 \right)\% = \frac{2000x}{3}\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is \(\boxed{\frac{2000x}{3}}\%\).<|im_end|>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much time Doctor Jones spends at the clinic, then subtract that from his total available time (nine hours), and finally determine how much time he has left after all these activities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Time Spent at the Clinic:**
   - Number of inpatients = 10
   - Time spent on each patient (routinely checking) = 20 minutes
   - Total time spent at the clinic = Number of inpatients * Time per patient
     \[
     \text{Total time at clinic} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Convert Total Time at the Clinic into Hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
   \[
   \frac{200}{60} = \frac{20}{6} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Subtract Time Spent at the Clinic from Total Available Time:**
   - Total available time = 9 hours
   - Time spent at the clinic = Approximately 3.33 hours
   \[
   \text{Time remaining} = 9 - \frac{10}{3} \approx 5.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate Remaining Time After Appointments:**
   - Number of appointments = 10
   - Time taken per appointment = 30 minutes
   - Total time taken for appointments = Number of appointments * Time per appointment
     \[
     \text{Total time for appointments} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Convert total time for appointments into hours:
     \[
     \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Subtract time remaining at the clinic from the time remaining after appointments.
   \[
   \text{Final time remaining} = 5.67 - 5 = 0.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Conclusion:
Doctor Jones will have approximately 0.67 hours (or 40 minutes) left to update his records after performing his duties at the clinic and attending to his appointments. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0.67 \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

<|im_start|>user
To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required from the moment she starts until she can have it ready for serving at 5 PM.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Making the Cake Batter**: This takes 20 minutes.
2. **Baking the Cake**: This takes 30 minutes.
3. **Cooling the Cake**: This requires 2 hours (which is 120 minutes).
4. **Frosting the Cake**: This takes an additional 10 minutes.

First, let's add up all these times together:

- Making the cake batter + Baking the cake = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes.
- Adding cooling time: 50 minutes + 120 minutes = 170 minutes (or 2 hours and 10 minutes).

So, the total time needed from when Jordan starts until the cake is ready is 170 minutes or 2 hours and 10 minutes.

Now, if Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5 PM, we need to subtract the total time required from 5 PM to find out how long she should start:

- Subtracting 170 minutes from 5 PM gives us 8:00 AM.

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready for service at 5 PM is **8:00 AM**.<|im_end|>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

Jordan needs to convert 180 minutes to hours so 180/60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours
If the cake needs to be finished by 5:00 pm and it will take 3 hours total to make then 5-3 = <<5-3=2>>2:00 pm is the latest she can start making the cake

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in one box based on the information provided about Lisa and Peter's sales.

1. **Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions:**
   - Lisa sold \(3 \frac{1}{2}\) boxes.
     \[
     3 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
     \]
   - Peter sold \(4 \frac{1}{2}\) boxes.
     \[
     4 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
     \]

2. **Add the two quantities together:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of boxes} = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars sold:**
   - Since each box contains the same number of chocolate bars, let \(x\) represent the number of chocolate bars per box.
   - The total number of chocolate bars sold is:
     \[
     8 \times x = 64
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   8x = 64
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{64}{8} = 8
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Each box contains 8 chocolate bars.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for renting the studio and then determine how many students can attend based on the number of sessions held.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost per Session
- The rental fee for the studio is $25.
- There is an additional charge of $1.50 per student per session.

Let's denote the number of students as \( n \).

So, the total cost per session is:
\[ \text{Total Cost Per Session} = 25 + 1.5n \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Sessions per Week
Given that there are 3 days a week and each day has one lesson, let’s assume each session lasts for one full hour (for simplicity). Therefore, if there are 3 days a week, it means there are 3 lessons per week.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings per Week
Since there are 3 sessions per week and each session has a total cost of:
\[ \text{Total Cost Per Session} = 25 + 1.5n \]

Then, the weekly earnings would be:
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 3 \times (\text{Total Cost Per Session}) \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 3 \times (25 + 1.5n) \]

### Step 4: Calculate Weekly Earnings per Month
There are typically 4 weeks in a month, so:
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 4 \times \text{Weekly Earnings} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 4 \times [3 \times (25 + 1.5n)] \]

### Step 5: Simplify the Expression
First, simplify inside the brackets:
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 4 \times [75 + 4.5n] \]

Now, distribute the 4 across both terms inside the brackets:
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 4 \times 75 + 4 \times 4.5n \]
\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = 300 + 18n \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be:
\[
\boxed{300 + 18n}
\]<|im_end|>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha, then compare these values.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.
   
2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Peter has is \( 4x \).
   - Martha has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars Martha has is \( 7x \).

3. **Formulate the Total Chocolate Bars Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Peter's total chocolate bars sum up to 64:
     \[
     4x = 64
     \]
   - Similarly, Martha's total chocolate bars sum up to 56:
     \[
     7x = 56
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Solve the equation for Peter:
     \[
     4x = 64 \\
     x = \frac{64}{4} \\
     x = 16
     \]
   - Verify the value of \( x \) using Martha's equation:
     \[
     7x = 56 \\
     7(16) = 112 \neq 56
     \]
     This indicates an error; let's recheck our calculations or assumptions. Since the initial setup seems correct, let's try solving it again carefully.

5. **Re-evaluate and Correct Calculation:**
   - Re-check the steps:
     - Peter’s equation should be:
       \[
       4x = 64 \\
       x = \frac{64}{4} \\
       x = 16
       \]
     - Martha’s equation should be:
       \[
       7x = 56 \\
       x = \frac{56}{7} \\
       x = 8
       \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - After correctly calculating, we find that each box contains 16 chocolate bars for Peter and 8 chocolate bars for Martha.

7. **Calculate Difference:**
   - The difference between the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha is:
     \[
     16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Therefore, Peter has **8 more chocolate bars** per box than Martha. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 8}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of male porcupines:**
   - We know that the total population of porcupines (both males and females) is 50.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of male porcupines.
   - Since the total population is the sum of male and female porcupines, we have:
     \[
     M + F = 50
     \]
   - Given that \( F = \frac{3}{5}F \), where \( F \) represents the number of female porcupines, we can find \( M \):
     \[
     M = 50 - F
     \]

2. **Find the number of female porcupines:**
   - From the given information, \( F = \frac{3}{5}M \).
   - Substitute \( F \) from the equation above:
     \[
     F = \frac{3}{5}(50 - F)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( F \):
     \[
     F = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 - \frac{3}{5}F
     \]
     \[
     F = 30 - \frac{3}{5}F
     \]
     \[
     F + \frac{3}{5}F = 30
     \]
     \[
     \frac{8}{5}F = 30
     \]
     \[
     F = \frac{30 \times 5}{8}
     \]
     \[
     F = \frac{150}{8}
     \]
     \[
     F = 18.75
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 18.75 female porcupines.

3. **Calculate the number of baby porcupines born each month:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies per month.
   - Number of baby porcupines per month = \( 4 \times 18.75 = 75 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of porcupines after one year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Total number of baby porcupines over the year = \( 75 \times 12 = 900 \).

5. **Add the initial number of porcupines to the number of new porcupines:**
   - Initial number of porcupines = 50.
   - Final number of porcupines after one year = \( 50 + 900 = 950 \).

**Final Answer:** After a year, there will be **950 porcupines** in the park.<|im_end|>","The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.

After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the total cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the price per gallon.

Let's start with step 1: Calculating the volume of the pool.

Step 1a: Find the area of the pool.
The pool has a rectangular shape, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given dimensions:
- Length \( L = 25 \) feet
- Width \( W = 14 \) feet
- Depth \( D = 4 \) feet

So,
\[ \text{Area} = L \times W = 25 \times 14 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 350 \text{ square feet} \]

Step 1b: Calculate the volume of the pool.
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Area} \times \text{Depth} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 350 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now let's move to step 2: Multiplying the volume by 5.9.

Step 2a: Calculate the number of gallons needed.
\[ \text{Gallons Needed} = \text{Volume} \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons Needed} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons Needed} = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Finally, step 3: Calculate the total cost.

Step 3a: Calculate the total cost.
The cost is given as $0.10 per gallon.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Gallons Needed} \times \text{Cost per Gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 826 \]

Therefore, the total amount it will cost to fill the pool is **$826**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sticks based on the given information.

1. **Identify the number of red sticks:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.
   
2. **Calculate the number of blue sticks:**
   - The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks.
   - Number of blue sticks = \( 9 + 5 \)
   - Number of blue sticks = 14
   
3. **Calculate the number of yellow sticks:**
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Number of yellow sticks = \( 14 - 3 \)
   - Number of yellow sticks = 11
   
4. **Sum up all the sticks:**
   - Red sticks: 9
   - Blue sticks: 14
   - Yellow sticks: 11
   - Total number of sticks = \( 9 + 14 + 11 \)

Let's perform the addition:

To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who are over 16 years old.**

Given that half of all students are over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of students who are over 16 years old but not male.**

Since one-fourth of those over 16 are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375 \]
Therefore, the number of female students among those over 16 is:
\[ \text{Number of female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of students who are under 16 years old.**

Given there are 3000 students in total:
\[ \text{Number of students under 16} = 3000 - 1500 = 1500 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of students who are under 16 years old but not male.**

Half of those under 16 are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \]
Therefore, the number of female students among those under 16 is:
\[ \text{Number of female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of female students at the school.**

Adding the female students from both groups (over 16 and under 16):

\[ = 3375 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water pumped on the first day is:
\[ 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 2: Determine how much water is left after the first day**

- After the first day, there will be:
\[ \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 7875 \]
\[ = 10125 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day**

- On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
\[ \text{Water pumped by Wanda on the second day} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 \]
\[ = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
\[ \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on the second day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 \]
\[ = 1125 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of water pumped on the second day is:
\[ 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days**

- Total water pumped over the two days:
\[ \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 \]
\[ = 12000 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 5: Determine how much more water is needed to reach the tank’s capacity**

- Subtract the total amount of water already pumped from the tank’s capacity:
\[ \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 \]
\[ = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000}

They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Charge**: We need to determine the initial charge level of the power bank.

   - Let \( x \) represent the percentage of the total capacity that the power bank initially had.
   
2. **Battery Loss During Park Time**:
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity every hour during the first 5 hours at the park.
   - After 5 hours, the battery loss is calculated as follows: 
     \[
     \text{Total Capacity Lost} = (0.09 \times \frac{x}{100}) \times 5 = 0.45x\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining capacity after 5 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Capacity} = x - 0.45x = 0.55x\%
     \]

3. **Second Period of Battery Loss**:
   - After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity per hour for about 3 hours.
   - The number of hours lost in the second period is 3.
   - The total capacity lost during the second period is:
     \[
     \text{Total Capacity Lost} = (0.07 \times \frac{x}{100}) \times 3 = 0.21x\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining capacity after the second period is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Capacity} = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x\%
     \]

4. **Final Condition**: At the end, the charge remaining is 28%.

   Given that the final charge is 28%, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.34x = 28
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{0.34} \approx 82.61\%
   \]

Therefore, the initial charge level of the power bank when Maria left home was approximately 82.61%.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}. 82.61%.<|im_end|>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour

Janet earns two different amounts per hour:
- Hourly wage: $10/hour
- Tips: $15/hour

Total earnings per hour = Wage + Tips
= $10 + $15
= $25/hour

### Step 2: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings

She works 40 hours per week.

Weekly earnings = Earnings per hour * Hours worked per week
= $25/hour * 40 hours/week
= $1000/week

### Step 3: Determine what percentage of her weekly earnings goes towards saving for the car

The car costs $10,000, but Janet only needs to save 20% of it.
So, the amount she saves per week = Cost of car * Savings rate
= $10,000 * 20%
= $2,000 savings per week

### Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks needed to reach her goal

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2,000, we divide the total savings required by her weekly savings.

Number of weeks = Total savings required / Weekly savings
= $2,000 / $1000/week
= 2 weeks

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\boxed{2} weeks.<|im_end|>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

1. **Identify the total amount Jamaar has:**
   - Jamaar earns $10 from mowing lawns.

2. **Determine the costs of the items Jamaar plans to purchase:**
   - Peaches: $0.5 each (3 peaches)
   - Pears: $0.5 each (4 pears)
   - Kiwis: $1 each (2 kiwis)

3. **Calculate the total cost for these fruits:**
   - Peaches: \(3 \times \$0.5 = \$1.5\)
   - Pears: \(4 \times \$0.5 = \$2.0\)
   - Kiwis: \(2 \times \$1 = \$2.0\)

   Total cost for peaches, pears, and kiwis:
   \[
   \$1.5 + \$2.0 + \$2.0 = \$5.5

   - Anne has a box containing 15 packs.
   - Each pack contains 60 pieces.
   
2. **Compute the total number of sweets in the box:**
   \[
   \text{Total sweets} = 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sweets} = 900 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Determine how many sweets Anne keeps for herself:**
   - Anne keeps 2 packs.
   - Each pack contains 60 pieces.
   
4. **Calculate the number of sweets Anne gives away:**
   \[
   \text{Sweets given away} = (15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs}) \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sweets given away} = 13 \times 60

The price of carrots in the grocery store increases by 5% of the original price every year. What would . be the price of carrots after three years if it was $120 initially? (Round to the nearest integer)
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the price of carrots after three years given an annual increase of 5%, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the initial price
The initial price of carrots is given as $120.

### Step 2: Calculate the price for the first year
Since there's no change from the beginning of the year, the price remains at its initial value.
\[ P_1 = \$120 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the price for the second year
The price increases by 5%. Therefore, we calculate the new price as follows:
\[ P_{\text{new}} = P_1 + 0.05 \times P_1 = 1.05 \times P_1 \]
Substituting \(P_1\) into this equation:
\[ P_{\text{second year}} = 1.05 \times 120 \approx \$126 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the price for the third year
The price again increases by 5%. We apply the same formula:
\[ P_{\text{third year}} = P_{\text{second year}} + 0.05 \times P_{\text{second year}} \]
Substituting \(P_{\text{second year}}\) into this equation:
\[ P_{\text{third year}} = 1.05 \times 126 \approx \$132.30 \]

### Step 5: Round the result to the nearest integer
After calculating the price for the third year, we round it to the nearest whole number:
\[ P_{\text{final}} = \$132 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately **$132**.<|im_end|>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia has uploaded 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums**: She used 8 different albums for these pictures.

3. **Selfies Only Albums**: 3 out of the 8 albums contain only selfies.

4. **Portraits Albums**: 2 out of the 8 albums contain only portraits.

5. **Non-Portrait Selfie Albums**: Since we know there are 3 albums that are all selfies, those must be included in the total count.

6. **Calculate Total Selfie Albums**: 
   - We already know there are 3 albums that are all selfies.
   - These 3 albums are part of the 8 total albums.
   
7. **Calculate Portrayal Albums**:
   - The remaining albums (after accounting for selfies) will be portraits.
   - Total albums = 8
   - Albums containing only portraits = 2
   
   Therefore, portraits-only albums = 8 - 3 (all selfies) = 5.

8. **Calculate Selfie Albums Including Portraits**:
   - We need to find how many albums include both portraits and selfies.
   - There are 2 portrait-only albums.
   - Since all albums can't be portrait-only or selfie-only, they must include at least one portrait and at least one selfie.

9. **Determine Selfie Albums Containing Portraits**:
   - If we assume portraits are more common than selfies, then some of the portrait-only albums might also contain selfies.
   - But since we don't have exact numbers, we'll proceed with the assumption that the most common distribution would be such that the portrait albums include at least one selfie.

Given the information provided, we cannot determine exactly how many portraits and selfies are in each album without additional specific data on which albums overlap. However, we can calculate the overall distribution based on the given constraints.

Since the problem doesn't specify any overlap between selfies and portraits other than what was stated initially, we conclude that the total number of portraits and selfies is simply the sum of the individual counts:

- Portraits: 5
- Selfies: 20 (since 72 total minus 5 portraits equals 67, but considering the overlaps)

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is}
\[
\text{Portraits} = 5, \text{Selfies} = 20

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many pages James can read per minute**:
   - James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.
   - Therefore, he reads \( \frac{3}{10} \) pages per minute.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages James wants to read**:
   - James reads 18 pages after deciding to go to sleep.

3. **Find out how long it will take James to read all those pages**:
   - We know that James reads at a rate of \( \frac{3}{10} \) pages per minute.
   - To find the time required to read 18 pages, we use the formula: Time = Total Pages / Rate.
   - So, Time = \( \frac{18}{\frac{3}{10}} \).

4. **Simplify the calculation**:
   - Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
   - Thus, Time = \( 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \).
   - Simplify further: \( 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \) minutes.

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many guests are currently at the hotel, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who checked out on Saturday morning**

- Total guests initially: **100**
- Guests who chose to check out early (Saturday): **24**

\[ \text{Guests who checked out} = 24 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of guests who chose to check out late on Saturday**

- Number of guests who chose to check out late: **15**

\[ \text{Total guests initially} - (\text{Guests who checked out}) = 100 - 24 = 76 \]

So, **76 guests were not checking out on Saturday**.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of guests who checked in on Sunday afternoon**

- Twice as many people checked in on Sunday as those who chose to check out late on Saturday:
  
\[ \text{People who checked in on Sunday} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

**Step 4: Add the number of guests who checked in on Sunday afternoon to those who stayed overnight**

- People staying overnight on Saturday: **76**

\[ \text{Total people remaining overnight on Saturday} = 76 \]

\[ \text{People who checked in on Sunday} + \text{People remaining overnight on Saturday} = 30 + 76 = 106 \]

**Step 5: Determine the number of people who checked in on Sunday evening**

- According to the problem, 7 more people checked in on Sunday evening:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of easy questions:**
   - There are 60 items in total.
   - 40% of these are easy.
   \[
   \text{Number of easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

2. **Determine the number of average questions:**
   - The remaining percentage is for average questions.
   \[
   \text{Percentage for average questions} = 100\% - 40\% = 60\%

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Define variables**

Let \( L \) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold.
Let \( S \) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold.

**Step 2: Set up equations based on given information**

- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large stuffed animals today: 
\[ S = 2L \]

- The total amount of money Teresa made is $120.
- Each small stuffed animal costs $4.

From these points, we can calculate the revenue from selling small stuffed animals:
\[ \text{Revenue from small stuffed animals} = 4S \]

Since the total earnings are $120, we can set up an equation that includes both types of stuffed animals:
\[ 4S + (3 \times 4L) = 120 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4S + 12L = 120 \]

**Step 3: Substitute \( S \) in terms of \( L \)**

We know \( S = 2L \), so substitute \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 4(2L) + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 8L + 12L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( L \)**

Divide both sides by 20:
\[ L = \frac{120}{20} \]
\[ L = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.

**Step 5: Find \( S \)**

Using \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold **12 small stuffed animals**.<|im_end|>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.

Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   - Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

2. **Sum the daily consumption for all members:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

3. **Calculate weekly consumption:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7.
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches}

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling cookies.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes.
3. Determine how much money was given to her sisters.
4. Subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total revenue.

Let's go through each step in detail:

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling cookies.**

Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 per cookie.
\[ \text{Revenue from cookies} = 80 \times \$1 = \$80 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes.**

Suzanne sold 60 cupcakes at $4 per cupcake.
\[ \text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 60 \times \$4 = \$240 \]

**Step 3: Determine how much money was given to her sisters.**

She gave each sister $10 and there are two sisters.
\[ \text{Money given to sisters} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total revenue.**

First, calculate the total revenue from both cookies and cupcakes.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Now, subtract the amount given to her sisters from the total revenue.
\[ \text{Money left} = \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of eggs hidden**: 
   - There are 100 eggs in total.

2. **Eggs found by the Smith twins**:
   - Each of the two Smith twins found 30 eggs.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is \(30 \times 2 = 60\).

3. **Remaining eggs after the Smiths' share**:
   - Subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs: \(100 - 60 = 40\) eggs remaining.

4. **Number of eggs left to be found by others**:
   - We know that out of these remaining 40 eggs, only 10 eggs were not found by anyone else (the Easter egg hunt team).
   - This means the rest must have been found by their friends: \(40 - 10 = 30\) eggs.

5. **Final check**:
   - Since we've accounted for all the eggs (100), and we've verified that the Smiths found exactly what they said they would, the remaining 30 eggs are indeed those found by the friends.

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is \(\boxed{30}\).<|im_end|>","The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe.
We know that a dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day using bare hands.

With an iron pickaxe, he mines twice as much:
\[ \text{Ore mined with iron pickaxe} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pounds/day} \]

With a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe:
\[ \text{Ore mined with steel pickaxe} = 24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in one day.
If one dwarf mines 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe, then 40 dwarves will mine:
\[ \text{Total ore mined by 40 dwarves per day} = 40 \times 36 = 1440 \text{ pounds/day} \]

### Step 3: Determine the total amount of ore mined over a period of 30 days.
Since we have 40 dwarves working for 30 days, the total ore mined would be:
\[ \text{Total ore mined in 30 days} = 1440 \times 30 = 43,200 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package containing 8 sandwiches based on the given information about the other packages.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Package size 1 (with 2 sandwiches): $3
   - Package size 2 (with 4 sandwiches): $6
   - The third package has an unknown number of sandwiches and its price is not indicated.

2. **Assume proportional pricing:**
   Since the prices are said to be proportional, we can assume that the price per sandwich is constant across all packages.

3. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the known packages:**
   - For the first package (2 sandwiches):
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]
   - For the second package (4 sandwiches):
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\$6}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of sandwiches in the unknown package:**
   Let \( n \) be the number of sandwiches in the third package.
   
5. **Set up the proportion equation using the known price per sandwich:**
   Since the price per sandwich is the same for all packages, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{n \text{ sandwiches}}{n \times \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}} = \frac{8 \text{ sandwiches}}{8 \times \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}}
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   \frac{n}{1.5n} = \frac{8}{1.5 \times 8}
   \]
   This simplifies further to:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1.5} = \frac{1}{1.5}
   \]

7. **Solve for \( n \):**
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, it implies that the number of sandwiches in the third package does not change the ratio. Therefore, we can directly conclude that the price for the third package should also follow the same proportion as the others.

8. **Conclusion:**
   Given that the third package's price must match the pattern observed from the two known packages, we find that the price for the third package with 8 sandwiches would also be $6.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

2. **Payment from Old Bedroom**:
   - Tom sells his old bedroom for $1000.
   - This money will be used to partially cover the cost of the new bedroom set.

3. **Remaining Amount After Payment from Old Bedroom**:
   - Subtract the amount received from selling the old bedroom ($1000) from the initial cost of the bedroom set ($3000).
     \[

Suddenly, : a , gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. ;  ? The shockingly loud sound . startled Sally, and she accidentally released half . of the ; yellow balloons. .  But as she neared the school grounds, : she found : 8 . blue balloons caught , in a tree, and she added 75% of them to . her : remaining : clutch . of balloons, ? which she carried into ? the ! school.  What number of balloons did she finally . carry into ; the school?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons initially.
Sally had:
- 25 red balloons,
- 7 green balloons,
- 12 yellow balloons.

Total initial balloons = 25 + 7 + 12 = **44** balloons.

### Step 2: Determine how many red balloons burst due to the wind.
40% of the red balloons burst.
Number of red balloons that burst = 40/100 * 25 = 10 red balloons.

So, after the wind, Sally has:
- Red balloons left = 25 - 10 = **15** red balloons,
- Green balloons remain unchanged at 7,
- Yellow balloons remain unchanged at 12.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released due to the wind.
Half of the yellow balloons were released.
Number of yellow balloons released = 1/2 * 12 = 6 yellow balloons.

Now, Sally has:
- Red balloons = 15,
- Green balloons = 7,
- Yellow balloons left = 12 - 6 = **6** yellow balloons.

### Step 4: Add the extra balloons Sally finds near the school.
She found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of these to her remaining balloons.

First, calculate 75% of the 8 blue balloons:
Number of blue balloons added = 75/100 * 8 = 6 blue balloons.

After adding the blue balloons, Sally now has:
- Blue balloons = 8 (found) + 6 (added) = **14** blue balloons,
- Green balloons = 7,
- Yellow balloons = 6.

### Final Calculation:
To find out the total number of balloons Sally carries into the school, we add all these together:

Total balloons = 15 (red) + 7 (green) + 14 (blue) + 6 (yellow) = **42** balloons.

Therefore, the final answer is: **42** balloons.<|im_end|>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible scenarios and their respective probabilities.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Probability of having no extensions:**
   - The probability that the normal teacher does not come or the substitution happens without extending the deadline.
     \[
     P(\text{No Extension}) = 0.5 \times (1 - 0.4) = 0.5 \times 0.6 = 0.3
     \]

2. **Probability of having an extension from the normal teacher:**
   - The probability that the normal teacher gives an extension but the student convinces her they ate the assignment.
     \[
     P(\text{Extension from Normal Teacher}) = 0.4 \times 0.2 = 0.08
     \]

3. **Probability of having an extension from the substitution:**
   - The probability that the substitution teacher gives an extension.
     \[
     P(\text{Extension from Substitution}) = 0.4 \times 0.7 = 0.28
     \]

Now, let's sum up these probabilities for the case where Marcus does have to turn in his homework due to either scenario:

- No extension and the normal teacher does not come:
  \[
  P(\text{No Extension} \cap \text{Normal Teacher Does Not Come}) = 0.3
  \]
  
- No extension and the substitution teacher comes:
  \[
  P(\text{No Extension} \cap \text{Substitution Teacher Comes}) = 0.3 \times 0.7 = 0.21
  \]

- An extension from the normal teacher and the substitution teacher does not come:
  \[
  P(\text{Extension from Normal Teacher} \cap \text{Substitution Teacher Does Not Come}) = 0.08
  \]

- An extension from the substitution teacher and the normal teacher does not come:
  \[
  P(\text{Extension from Substitution Teacher} \cap \text{Normal Teacher Does Not Come}) = 0.28
  \]

Finally, summing up all these probabilities:
\[
P(\text{Turns in Homework}) = 0.3 + 0.21 + 0.08 + 0.28 = 0.87
\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 87%.

**The final answer is:** 87%.<|im_end|>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

                    question:
                    Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts . Center this year which has space for ? 6000 ? people.  .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the total number of seats available at the Fine Arts Center.
2. Subtract the seats reserved for graduates from the total seats.
3. Subtract the seats reserved for faculty attendees from the remaining seats.
4. Divide the remaining seats by the number of students (graduates) to determine how many tickets each student will receive.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Total Number of Seats Available
- The Fine Arts Center can accommodate up to 6000 people.

### Step 2: Seats Reserved for Graduates
- There are 950 seats reserved for graduating students.

### Step 3: Seats Reserved for Faculty Attending
- There are 300 seats reserved for faculty members attending the event.

### Step 4: Calculate Remaining Seats
- Subtract the seats reserved for graduates from the total seats:
\[ 6000 - 950 = 5050 \]

- Subtract the seats reserved for faculty members from the remaining seats:
\[ 5050 - 300 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left for other guests.

### Step 5: Determine How Many Tickets Each Student Will Receive
- There are 6000 students (graduates + non-students).

Since we have already calculated that there are 4750 seats available for other guests, each student would receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{6000} = \frac{475}{600} = \frac{95}{120} \approx 8.0833 \]

Therefore, each student will receive approximately 8.0833 tickets.

In conclusion, each graduate would receive about 8.0833 tickets, but since tickets cannot be fractional, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, each graduate would receive 8 tickets.

The final answer is: **The final answer is** 8.<|im_end|>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of large jelly beans needed.
Grandpa needs 75 large jelly beans to fill him up.

### Step 2: Calculate how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
We know that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large ones. Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of large beans} \]
Given there are 75 large beans:
\[ \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
We also know that eating three small jelly beans is equivalent to eating one medium-sized jelly bean. This means:
\[ 3 \text{ small beans} = 1 \text{ medium-sized bean} \]

From this equivalence, we can determine how many medium-sized beans correspond to one small bean:
\[ \text{Medium-sized beans for 1 small bean} = 3 \]

Since there are 150 medium-sized beans, which is equivalent to 75 large beans (from Step 1), then:
\[ \text{Small beans for 1 medium-sized bean} = 3 \]

Now, to find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat using these medium-sized beans:
\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \div 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} \]
\[ \text{Number of small beans} = 50 \]

### Final Answer:
Grandpa can eat **50** small jelly beans.<|im_end|>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total time spent on jury duty**

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days.

\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate total earnings from daily pay**

Melissa earns $15 per day.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$15 \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$15 \times 18 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$270 \]

**Step 3: Calculate total parking expenses**

Melissa has to pay $3 for parking each day.

\[ \text{Parking cost per day} = \$3 \]

\[ \text{Total parking cost} = \$3 \times 3 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total parking cost} = \$9 \]

**Step 4: Calculate net earnings**

Subtract parking costs from total earnings.

\[ \text{Net earnings} = \$270 - \$9 \]

\[ \text{Net earnings} = \$261 \]

**Step 5: Calculate hourly rate including expenses**

To find out her hourly rate, we need to divide the net earnings by the total number of hours worked.

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$261}{18 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Hourly rate} = \$14.50 \text{ (rounded)} \]

Therefore, Melissa makes approximately **\$14.50** per hour after all expenses.<|im_end|>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pencils**

Ted buys 3 pencils at $6 each.

Cost per pencil = $6
Number of pencils = 3

Total cost for pencils = Cost per pencil × Number of pencils

   - Each trip consists of going from one bottle to the next and then dropping the candy.

2. **Calculate the total distance covered by Richard during these trips:**
   - Since there are 8 bottles and he places a bottle every 3 feet, the total distance covered is \(8 \times 3 = 24\) feet.

3. **Calculate the time taken for each trip:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds per trip.

4. **Calculate the total time required for all trips:**

2. Calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese.
3. Add the costs from both cheeses together to find the total amount spent.
4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money to determine if there's any remaining.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese.
- Price of one pound of Parmesan = $11
- Amount bought = 2 pounds
- Total cost for Parmesan = 2 * $11 = $22

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese.
- Price of one pound of Mozzarella = $6
- Amount bought = 3 pounds
- Total cost for Mozzarella = 3 * $6 = $18

### Step 3: Add the costs from both cheeses together.
Total cost = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella
Total cost = $22 (Parmesan) + $18 (Mozzarella)
Total cost = $40

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money.
Initial amount of money = $50
Remaining money = Initial amount - Total cost
Remaining money = $50 - $40 = $10

### Conclusion:
Amor has $10 left after buying the cheese.

                    question:
                    Jim decides to ! go to college to earn some more money. ;  . It takes him 4 years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  If : he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long would it take to ; earn the money equivalent to . the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate two things: (1) how much money Jim can earn in total over the course of his education and (2) how long it will take for him to save that amount.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Income Over Time
Jim's loan payments are $50,000 per year for 4 years:

\[ \text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = \$200,000 \]

He also has a job paying him $25,000 per year without college:

\[ \text{Income Without College} = 25,000 \times 4 = \$100,000 \]

So, if he were to work at his current job full-time during his college years, he would be earning an additional $100,000 over the same period. However, since he goes to college part-time or doesn't have any jobs outside of college, he only earns $50,000 per year on average.

### Step 2: Calculate Savings
Let's assume Jim saves all of his earnings from college until he finishes. His total savings after 4 years of college would be:

\[ \text{Savings} = 50,000 \times 4 = \$200,000 \]

However, we know he already owes $200,000 in loans, so let’s subtract that from his savings:

\[ \text{Net Savings} = 200,000 - 200,000 = \$0 \]

This means Jim does not actually save any money during his time in college. He uses up all of his earned income within the first four years.

### Conclusion
Since Jim does not save any money during his college years and he needs to cover the $200,000 in loans plus whatever he loses from not working ($100,000), he cannot afford to go to college as planned because he won’t even save enough to pay off his debts. Therefore, based on these calculations, it is impossible for Jim to achieve the financial goal he set himself under the given conditions. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Jim cannot afford to go to college under the given conditions.<|im_end|>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years

                    question:
                    Jim is making a comforter for his king-sized : bed. He needs two pieces of fabric . that are 2 ! feet . longer and ! 2 feet wider ? than the bed, which measures , 6 feet long , by 8 ? feet ? wide. ? How ? many square feet ; of fabric , does Jim need to buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the two pieces of fabric needed for the comforter and then calculate their total area.

### Step 1: Determine the dimensions of one piece of fabric.
- The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width.
- Each piece of fabric must be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

#### Length of Fabric:
\[
\text{Length} = \text{Bed length} + 2 \times 2 = 6 + 4 = 10 \text{ feet}
\]

#### Width of Fabric:
\[
\text{Width} = \text{Bed width} + 2 \times 2 = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric.
The area of one piece of fabric can be calculated using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 120 \text{ square feet}
\]

Since Jim needs two such pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:

\[
\text{Total Area} = 120 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 240 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Final Answer:
Jim needs to buy **240 square feet** of fabric.<|im_end|>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet
Then find the width of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's width: 8 feet + 2 feet = <<8+2=10>>10 feet
Then find the square footage of each piece of fabric by multiplying its length and width: 8 feet * 10 feet = <<8*10=80>>80 square feet
Then double that amount since Jim needs two pieces of fabric: 80 square feet/piece * 2 pieces = <<80*2=160>>160 square feet

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday and Wednesday based on the information provided.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday**
- The post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday.
- One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is \( \frac{425}{5} = 85 \).
- Therefore, on Tuesday, the post office delivered \( 85 + 17 = 102 \) letters.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday**
- The post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday.
- Twice as many letters as on Tuesday is \( 2 \times 102 = 204 \).
- Therefore, on Wednesday, the post office delivered \( 204 + 5 = 209 \) letters.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday**

Let's add up all the letters delivered:

- **Monday:** 425 letters
- **Tuesday:** 102 letters
- **Wednesday:** 209 letters

Total letters delivered = \( 425 + 102 + 209 \)

Now let's perform the addition:

\[
425 + 102 = 527
\]

\[
527 + 209 = 736
\]

Therefore, the post office delivered a total of 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.

**Final Answer: The final answer is 736.**<|im_end|>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the total amount Molly will pay for catering, we need to calculate the cost based on the number of guests who prefer different types of salads.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for the chicken salad.
- Number of people wanting chicken salad = 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad = $6.50

\[
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
\]

\[
= 10 \times 6.50
\]

\[
= 65.00
\]

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the pasta salad.
- Number of people wanting pasta salad = 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad = $6

\[
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
\]

\[
= 6 \times 6
\]

\[
= 36
\]

Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total catering cost.

\[
\text{Total catering cost} = \text{Total cost for chicken salad} + \text{Total cost for pasta salad}
\]

\[
= 65.00 + 36
\]

\[
= 101.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.<|im_end|>","Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.

                    question:
                    Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his dad bet ; money. On the first race, he : lost $5. ; On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost : 1.5 times as ! much as he won in the second . race.

<|im_start|>system
To find out how much Johnny lost on average over those three races, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the winnings from the second race.
Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he had lost in the first race.

- He lost $5 in the first race.
- Twice the amount lost in the first race = $5 * 2 = $10.
- Therefore, he won $1 + $10 = $11 in the second race.

### Step 2: Calculate the losses from the third race.
Johnny lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

- He won $11 in the second race.
- 1.5 times the winnings in the second race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.
- Therefore, he lost $16.5 in the third race.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount lost during the three races.
- First race loss: -$5
- Second race win: $11
- Third race loss: -$16.5

Total loss = -$5 + $11 - $16.5 = -$10.5

### Step 4: Calculate the average loss per race.
Since there were three races, we divide the total loss by the number of races.

Average loss = -$10.5 / 3 = -$3.5

### Conclusion:
Johnny lost an average of $3.5 per race that day.

There are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities.

\[
\text{Total number of cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Cities per country}

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total number of cities} = 26 \times 5 = 130 \text{ cities}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of people in all the cities.
Each city has 1000 people living in it.

\[
\text{Total number of people per city} = 1000 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, the total number of people in all the cities can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of cities} \times \text{People per city}

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000 \text{ people}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided:

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
1. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
2. The third person took twice what the second person did, so the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount distributed is $1920. Therefore, the sum of their shares should equal $1920.

So, we have the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

First, combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:**
   - The problem states that they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day every day.
   - They worked for 3 weeks.

2. **Convert weeks to days:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, \( 3 \) weeks = \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.

3. **Determine the total number of working days:**
   - Each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day per day.
   - For 21 days, each painter would have worked \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of work done by one painter:**
   - Work done by one painter = \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} \).
   - Simplify the expression: 
     \[
     21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8}
     \]

5. **Convert the work done by one painter from days to hours:**
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day,
   - Each painter's work in hours = \( \frac{63}{8} \times 24 \).

6. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{63}{8} \):
     \[
     \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ (hours per painter)}
     \]
   - Then multiply by 24 hours:
     \[
     7.875 \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours}

1. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation.

\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

2. To combine the fractions, find a common denominator. The common denominator here is 2.

\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{1x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{4}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + \frac{5x}{2} = 19 \]

3. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2.

\[ 2(2x) + 2\left(\frac{5x}{2}\right) = 2(19) \]
\[ 4x + 5x = 38 \]
\[ 9x = 38 \]

4. Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{38}{9} \approx 4.22 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of balls, it must be an integer. Given that \( x \) should be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our steps or consider if there was an error in the interpretation or calculation. However, since the context suggests a straightforward arithmetic solution, let's assume the problem might have intended a simpler integer value for verification purposes.

Given \( x \) is approximately 4.22, let's round down to the nearest whole number because typically problems in such contexts expect exact answers:

\[ x = 4 \]

Now, substitute \( x \) back into the expressions for the first two sets:

1. Second set: \( x = 4 \)
   - First set: \( x + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \)

So, Rory retrieves 8 tennis balls in the first set.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

                    question:
                    Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of . 21% per year. ! Find the price of the car in the year 2010.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of years between 2007 and 2010
- Start year (initial): 2007
- End year (final): 2010
- Number of years = 2010 - 2007 = 3 years

### Step 2: Calculate the depreciation factor
The car's value decreases by 21%. To express this as a decimal, divide 21% by 100:
\[ \text{Depreciation Factor} = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79 \]

### Step 3: Apply the depreciation formula
The general formula for depreciation over \( n \) years is:
\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^n \]
where:
- \( P(t) \) is the future value of the car,
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate,
- \( n \) is the number of years.

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
First, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.49379 \]

Now, multiply this result by the initial price:
\[ P(3) = 20000 \times 0.49379 \approx 9875.8 \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 will be approximately **$9875.8**.<|im_end|>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books are written in Spanish based on the given percentages.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Total number of books**: The total number of books in the library is given as 50.
2. **Books written in English**:
   - We know that half of the books are written in English.
   - Therefore, the number of English books = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \).
3. **Calculating English books**:
   \[
   \text{English books} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]
4. **Books written in German**:
   - It is stated that 10% of the books are written in German.
   - Therefore, the number of German books = \( 10\% \) of 50.
5. **Calculating German books**:
   \[
   \text{German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]
6. **Spanish books calculation**:
   - Since all other books are written in Spanish, the number of Spanish books can be found by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
7. **Calculating Spanish books**:
   \[
   \text{Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{English books} + \text{German books})
   \]
8. **Substituting the values**:
   \[
   \text{Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5)
   \]
9. **Simplifying**:
   \[
   \text{Spanish books} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

### Conclusion:
There are 20 Spanish books in the library.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total distance between San Diego, CA and New York City, NY:**
   - The given information states that the distance is approximately 1955 kilometers.

2. **Determine the distance driven by Bernice so far:**
   - Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over 4 days.

3. **Calculate the remaining distance she needs to drive:**
   - To find out how many more kilometers Bernice needs to drive, we subtract the distance already covered (325 km) from the total distance (1955 km).

Let's perform these calculations:

\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = \text{Total Distance} - \text{Distance Driven}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km}
\]

Now, do the subtraction:

\[
1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive **1630 kilometers** to reach her destination.<|im_end|>","325 * 4 = <<325*4=1300>>1300 km

- **Initial Number of People**: 120

### Step 2: First Stop
- **Number of People Boarding**: 20
- **Total After First Stop**:
  \[

### Step 4: Third Stop
- **Number of People Descending**: 80
- **Number of People Remaining Before Third Stop**:

To solve this problem, we need to break down the costs and apply discounts step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the shorts.
- The tank top costs $10.
- The shorts are $5 more expensive than the tank top.
\[ \text{Cost of shorts} = \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the original cost of the sneakers.
- The sneakers have an original price of $48.
- They are on sale at half price.
\[ \text{Sale price of sneakers} = \frac{\$48}{2} = \$24 \]

### Step 3: Apply the discount from the coupon.
- The coupon gives her $2 off the total.
\[ \text{Total before discount} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 = \$59 \]
\[ \text{Discounted total} = \$59 - \$2 = \$57 \]

### Step 4: Add up all the expenses.
- Tank top: $10
- Shorts: $15
- Sneakers: $24
- Socks (before discount): $8
\[ \text{Final total} = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + (\$8 - \$2) = \$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 = \$55 \]

To determine how much it will cost you to renovate your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet.
   - Each tile covers an area of \(1 \text{ ft}^2\).
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is equal to the total area divided by the area covered per tile:
     \[
     \frac{200 \text{ sq ft}}{1 \text{ sq ft/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
     \]

2. **Determine the total cost for all the tiles:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - So, the total cost for all tiles would be:
     \[
     200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much James will pay per year for his insurance after the accident, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
- The normal monthly cost is $120.
- Due to the accident, the cost increases by 60%.

First, calculate 60% of the normal monthly cost:
\[ \text{Increased Cost} = 120 \times 0.60 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the increased monthly cost due to the accident is $72.

### Step 2: Determine the total monthly cost after the increase.
Add the increased cost to the normal monthly cost:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 \]

Let's perform this addition:
\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Therefore, the total monthly cost after the accident is $192.

### Step 3: Calculate the annual cost.
Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the total monthly cost by 12:
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 \]

Let's perform this multiplication:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, James will pay $2304 annually for his insurance after the accident.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many sheet sets Greg uses per week**
Greg uses 5 sheet sets per week (4 twin beds + 1 king size bed).

**Step 2: Calculate the number of sheet sets washed per load**
His washing machine can wash either:
- 2 twin sets of sheets or
- 1 king set of sheets.

Since his sheets are mixed between twins and kings, we need to find out which combination allows for the maximum efficiency given the constraints.

Let's consider both scenarios:

a) Washing 2 twin sets at a time:
   - Number of loads = total sheet sets / (sheet sets per load)
   - Number of loads = 5 / 2 = 2.5 loads (since you can't have half a load)

b) Washing 1 king set at a time:
   - Number of loads = total sheet sets / king sets per load
   - Number of loads = 5 / 1 = 5 loads

c) Washing 1 twin set at a time:
   - Number of loads = total sheet sets / twin sets per load
   - Number of loads = 5 / 2 = 2.5 loads

From these calculations, option b seems more practical as it results in whole numbers without needing fractional loads.

**Step 3: Determine the number of weeks in a year**
There are 52 weeks in a year.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of loads needed in a year**
Total loads in a year = Total sheet sets / Sheet sets per load * Weeks in a year
Total loads in a year = 5 / 2 * 52
Total loads in a year = 2.5 * 52
Total loads in a year = 130 loads

Therefore, Greg needs to do **130 loads of laundry in a year** using the washing machine settings that maximize efficiency while handling all types of sheet sets available to him.<|im_end|>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of movies watched on both days:**
   - On Saturday, Jill watches 4 movies.
   - On Sunday, she watches half the number of movies as on Saturday.

2. **Calculate the total number of movies watched over one weekend:**
   - Total movies on Saturday = 4
   - Total movies on Sunday = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \)
   - Total movies watched over one weekend (Saturday + Sunday) = \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)

3. **Determine the number of weekends in 4 weeks:**
   - There are 4 weeks, so there are \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) weekends in 4 weeks.

4. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks:**
   - Since they watch 6 movies per weekend, for 8 weekends, the total number of movies watched would be \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 48 movies.<|im_end|>","They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's three cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily consumption per cat:**
   - Imma feeds her cats twice a day.
   - Each feeding provides 60 grams of cat food.

   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption per cat} = 2 \times 60 \text{ grams}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption per cat} = 120 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption for all three cats:**
   - There are three cats.

   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption for all three cats} = 3 \times 120 \text{ grams}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption for all three cats} = 360 \text{ grams}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the total amount of cat food (720 grams) will last:**
   - We have 720 grams of cat food available.

   \[
   \text{Number of days the food will last} = \frac{\text{Total amount of cat food}}{\text{Total daily consumption}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of days the food will last} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of days the food will last} = 2 \text{ days}
   \]

### Conclusion:
720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's three cats for 2 days. 

\[
\boxed{2 \text{ days}}
\]<|im_end|>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of slices eaten by each person based on the given information and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of slices:**
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - Total number of slices = \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

2. **Identify the number of slices eaten by each person:**
   - Let's denote the number of slices Jake eats as \( J \).
   - According to the problem, Becky ate 10 slices.
   - It is also stated that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
     Therefore, if \( J \) is the number of slices Jake ate, then:
     \[ J + 3 = 10 \]
     Solving for \( J \):
     \[ J = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

3. **Calculate the number of slices eaten by Silvia:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
     Therefore, Silvia ate:
     \[ 2 \times J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \] slices.

4. **Sum the slices eaten by all three people:**
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - Total slices eaten = \( 7 + 10 + 14 = 31 \).

### Final Answer:
\[

                    Betsy and Donovan made a meal together. Betsy's part took 18 : minutes longer than Donovan's part. The meal was made in 98 minutes. How many minutes long was Betsy's part?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Betsy's part of the meal took. Let's denote the time Donovan spent on his part as \( x \) minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, Betsy's part took \( x + 18 \) minutes.

The total time taken for both parts combined is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + (x + 18) = 98 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[ x + x + 18 = 98 \]
   \[ 2x + 18 = 98 \]

2. Subtract 18 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 2x = 98 - 18 \]
   \[ 2x = 80 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = \frac{80}{2} \]
   \[ x = 40 \]

So, Donovan spent 40 minutes on his part. Now, we need to find out how long Betsy's part took. According to our earlier notation, Betsy's part was \( x + 18 \) minutes. Substituting the value of \( x \):

\[ \text{Betsy's part} = 40 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Betsy's part} = 58 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and calculate each component separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the cast
The cost of the cast is given as $200.
\[ \text{Cost of cast} = \$200 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the visit
The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit.
First, convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
So, the hourly rate is $300. For 0.5 hours, the cost is:
\[ \text{Cost of visit} = \$300 \times 0.5 = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the painkillers
The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 pills.
Since 30 pills are charged at $4 each, the total cost is:
\[ \text{Total cost of painkillers} = 30 \times 4 = \$120 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the parking
The doctor requires a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. Since he charges $6 per hour for parking, the cost is:
\[ \text{Cost of parking} = 2 \times 6 = \$12 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all costs
Now, we add up all the individual costs to find the total amount spent by the doctor:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cast} + \text{Cost of visit} + \text{Total cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$200 + \$150 + \$120 + \$12 = \$582 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor’s visit is $\boxed{\$582}$.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response:**
   - James receives 80 emails per day.
   - 20% of these emails do not require a response.

Let's calculate the number of emails that require a response first:

\[
\text{Number of emails requiring a response} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 80
\]

\[

\]

So, James responds to 16 emails daily.

2. **Calculate the total number of emails he responds to over a 5-day work week:**

Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

\[
\text{Total emails responded in a week} = 16 \times 5

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of students on Tuesday:**
   - Given that twice as many students visited on Tuesday compared to Monday.
   - Number of students on Monday = 32.
   - Therefore, number of students on Tuesday = \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \).

2. **Calculate the number of students on Wednesday:**
   - Given that three times as many students visited on Wednesday compared to Tuesday.
   - Number of students on Tuesday = 64.
   - Therefore, number of students on Wednesday = \( 64 \times 3 = 192 \).

3. **Calculate the number of students on Thursday:**
   - Given that 25 students visited on Thursday.
   - Number of students on Thursday = 25.

4. **Sum up all the visits from Monday to Friday:**
   - Monday = 32
   - Tuesday = 64
   - Wednesday = 192
   - Thursday = 25
   - Total = \( 32 + 64 + 192 + 25 \)

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First add Monday and Tuesday: \( 32 + 64 = 96 \).
   - Then add Wednesday: \( 96 + 192 = 288 \).
   - Finally, add Thursday: \( 288 + 25 = 313 \).

To find John's average score across the four tests, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total score for the first three tests**
John scored 100 on each of the first three tests.

\[ \text{Total score for first three tests} = 100 + 100 + 100 \]

Let’s compute this sum.
\[
100 + 100 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 100 = 300
\]

So, the total score for the first three tests is **300**.

**Step 2: Add the score from the fourth test**
John also took a fourth test where he scored 80.

\[
\text{Total score for all four tests} = 300 + 80
\]

Let’s compute this sum.
\[
300 + 80 = 380
\]

Now, we have the total score for all four tests as **380**.

**Step 3: Divide the total score by the number of tests (which is 4) to find the average**

\[
\text{Average score} = \frac{\text{Total score}}{\text{Number of tests}}
\]

Substitute the values into the equation:
\[
\text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4}
\]

Let’s perform the division.
\[
380 \div 4 = 95
\]

Therefore, John's average score across the four tests is **95**.

4. Determine how many pizzas the football team ordered in total.
5. Find out how many pizzas are left after both groups have eaten.

Let's start with the glee! club:

1. **Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the glee! club:**
   - They ordered 20 pizzas.
   - They ate 70% of those pizzas.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas eaten} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
   \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas the glee! club ordered in total:**
   - Since they ate 14 pizzas, that means they also ordered 20 pizzas (as given).

3. **Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the football team:**
   - They ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee! club.
   - Twice the amount of pizzas ordered by the glee! club would be \(2 \times 20 = 40\) pizzas.
   - They ate 80% of those pizzas.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas eaten} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32

4. **Determine how many pizzas the football team ordered in total:**
   - As calculated above, they ordered 40 pizzas.

5. **Find out how many pizzas are left after both groups have eaten:**

   First, calculate the total number of pizzas eaten by both groups:
   
   \[
   \text{Total pizzas eaten} = 14 + 32 = 46

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of big coupons:**
   - Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small ones.
   - He has 700 small coupons.
   - Number of big coupons = 2 × 700 = 1400 big coupons.

2. **Calculate the cost for small coupons:**
   - Each small coupon costs 5 cents.
   - Total cost for small coupons = 700 × 5 = 3500 cents.

3. **Calculate the cost for big coupons:**
   - Each big coupon costs 15 cents.
   - Total cost for big coupons = 1400 × 15 = 21000 cents.

4. **Add up the costs to find the total amount spent on postage:**
   - Total cost (postage) = Cost for small coupons + Cost for big coupons
   - Total cost = 3500 cents + 21000 cents = 24500 cents.

Therefore, Anthony spends a total of 24500 cents on postage.<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35

Then multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon to find the total cost of the big coupons: $0.15/coupon * 1400 coupons = $<<0.15*1400=210>>210
Then add the costs of each size of coupon to find the total cost: $210 + $35 = $<<210+35=245>>245

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney originally ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten meatball sub sandwiches = \(10\).
   - Therefore, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had after Mark ate some:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Sidney initially had 7 sub sandwiches.
   - After Mark ate 4, Sidney has \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches remaining.

3. **Determine how many additional meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.

4. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in all the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - Each original sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Sidney initially had 3 sub sandwiches left.
   - Each of these 3 sub sandwiches still contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

So, the final answer is: \(\boxed{12}\).<|im_end|>","3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched:**
   - Mr. Hezekiah has 20 trucks.

2. **Calculate the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failure:**
   - A quarter (1/4) of the trucks failed.
   - Number of trucks that failed = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \)

3. **Calculate the number of trucks that delivered successfully:**
   - Number of trucks that delivered successfully = Total trucks - Trucks that failed

4. **Calculate the total amount of fertilizer transported:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer.
   - Total tons per truck = 20 tons.
   - Total tons transported = Number of trucks * Tons per truck

5. **Subtract the number of trucks that failed from the total number of trucks to find the number of trucks that delivered successfully.**

6. **Multiply the number of successful deliveries by the tonnage per truck to get the total tons of fertilizer delivered.**

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Total number of trucks dispatched = 20.
   
2. Number of trucks that failed = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \).

3. Number of trucks that delivered successfully = 20 - 5 = 15.

4. Total tons transported = 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 300 tons.<|im_end|>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of croissants needed**

Dennis wants to make 6 dozen croissants.
- 1 dozen = 12 croissants
- Total croissants needed = 6 × 12 = 72 croissants

**Step 2: Determine the amount of butter required**

For every dozen croissants, Dennis uses 1 pound of butter.
- For 72 croissants (which is 6 dozens), he will need 72 × 1 = 72 pounds of butter.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost without the discount**

The price of butter is $4.00 per pound.
- Cost of 72 pounds of butter = 72 × $4.00 = $288.00

**Step 4: Apply the discount on the purchased butter**

The promotion offers ""buy one pound of butter get one half off"".
- This means for every pound bought, you get half at no extra charge.
- Since Dennis buys 72 pounds, he gets 36 pounds at full price and 36 pounds at half price.

Cost calculation:
- Full price for 36 pounds = 36 × $4.00 = $144.00
- Half-price for 36 pounds = 36 × ($4.00 / 2) = 36 × $2.00 = $72.00

Total cost after applying the discount = $144.00 + $72.00 = $216.00

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is $216.00. Therefore, it will cost Dennis $216.00 to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion.<|im_end|>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total guests:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - She has 13 family members.

   Total number of guests = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45

2. **Determine the cost structure:**
   - There is an initial charge of $125 for renting the theater.
   - For each additional guest after the first 20, there is an extra charge of $6 per guest.

3. **Subtract the maximum capacity (20) since only 4 people can't attend:**
   - Initial charge = $125
   - Number of guests who can't attend = 4
   - Cost for these 4 guests = $6 * 4 = $24

4. **Calculate the remaining number of guests that can be accommodated:**
   - Total guests invited = 45
   - Guests who can't attend = 4
   - Remaining guests = 45 - 4 = 41

5. **Calculate the cost for the remaining guests beyond the first 20:**
   - Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21
   - Cost per additional guest = $6
   - Cost for the remaining guests = $6 * 21 = $126

6. **Add the initial charge to the cost for the remaining guests:**
   - Final cost = Initial charge + Cost for remaining guests
   - Final cost = $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost of the party will be $\boxed{251}$.<|im_end|>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money both Maggie and Riza have left after they spend some of their initial amounts.

### Step 1: Determine the initial amount of money each person has.
Both Maggie and Riza start with $60.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money each spends.
- **Maggie**: She spends a quarter (1/4) of her money.
  \[
  \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
  \]
  Therefore, Maggie has:
  \[
  \text{Money left for Maggie} = 60 - 15 = 45
  \]

- **Riza**: She spends one-third (1/3) of her money.
  \[
  \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
  \]
  Therefore, Riza has:
  \[
  \text{Money left for Riza} = 60 - 20 = 40
  \]

### Step 3: Sum up the remaining money from both Maggie and Riza.
\[
\text{Total money left} = 45 + 40 = 85
\]

Thus, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is $\boxed{85}$.<|im_end|>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.

To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of bananas bought**: 315
2. **Number of monkeys**: 3
3. **Bananas per monkey per day**:
   - First monkey: 10 bananas/day
   - Second monkey: \(10 + 4 = 14\) bananas/day (since it eats 4 more bananas than the first)
   - Third monkey: Let's denote this as \(x\)

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of bananas consumed by all three monkeys over one week.

- Total bananas per day for all monkeys combined: 
\[ 10 + 14 + x \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the total bananas consumed by all monkeys in a week would be:
\[ (10 + 14 + x) \times 7 \]

We know that these bananas are sufficient to feed them for a whole week. Therefore, the total bananas eaten by all monkeys in a week should equal the total number of bananas Mr. Robles bought:
\[ (10 + 14 + x) \times 7 = 315 \]

Now, simplify and solve for \(x\):
\[ (10 + 14 + x) \times 7 = 315 \]
\[ (24 + x) \times 7 = 315 \]
\[ 24 + x = \frac{315}{7} \]
\[ 24 + x = 45 \]
\[ x = 45 - 24 \]
\[ x = 21 \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats **21 bananas each day**.<|im_end|>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many puzzles Teddy worked on:**
   - Teddy completed half of a 500-piece puzzle.
   - Half of 500 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{500}{2} = 250
     \]
   So, Teddy placed 250 puzzle pieces from the first puzzle.

2. **Calculate how many puzzles he worked on in total:**
   - Teddy also completed another puzzle within one hour.
   - The second puzzle has 500 pieces.
   - We already know he placed 250 pieces from the first puzzle.

3. **Identify the time period:**
   - Teddy finished both puzzles within one hour.

4. **Conclude the amount of puzzle pieces placed during that hour:**

                <|im_end|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $2.
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost of roses} = 15 \times \$2 = \$30
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has initially:**
   - She arrives with 5 $5 bills.

   \[
   \text{Total initial money} = 5 \times \$5 = \$25
   \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from her initial money to find out how much money she has left after buying the roses:**

   \[
   \text{Money left} = \$25 - \$30 = -\$5
   \]
   
   This result indicates that Jenny would be short of funds by $5. Since she cannot use negative money in terms of her purchases, it means she cannot afford the roses at all given her current budget.

4. **Since she cannot afford the roses, she will not receive any change from the florist.** Therefore, she leaves with no money.

Given the constraints (she can only pay using quarters), she cannot make up the difference even if she had more money or was able to borrow from someone else. Thus, she leaves with zero quarters.

To determine how much money Terry makes in total, we need to calculate the revenue from selling all his items.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Milkshakes:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times \$5.50 \]

\[
= 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

#### Burger Platters:
- Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from burger platters} = 9 \times \$11 \]

\[
= \$99
\]

#### Sodas:
- Terry has 20 sodas priced at $1.50 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from sodas} = 20 \times \$1.50 \]

\[
= \$30
\]

### Total Revenue Calculation:
Now, add up the revenues from all items to find the total amount of money Terry makes.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = (\text{Revenue from milkshakes}) + (\text{Revenue from burger platters}) + (\text{Revenue from sodas})
\]

\[
= (33) + (99) + (30)
\]

\[
= 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \text{ dollars}
\]

<|im_start|>system
To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule:

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled arrival: 10 minutes from now.
   - Stay in station: 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives: Half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train departs.
   - Stay in station: Quarter of the first train's stay = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives: An hour after the second train departs.
   - Leaves immediately after arriving.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives: 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Departs when the third train leaves.

Now let's calculate the total waiting time for Paul:

1. **Waiting for First Train:**
   - Total time before the first train arrives = 10 minutes.
   - Time spent in station = 20 minutes.
   - Total waiting time for the first train = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

2. **Waiting for Second Train:**
   - Time before the second train arrives = 30 minutes.
   - Time spent in station = 5 minutes.
   - Total waiting time for the second train = 30 + 5 = 35 minutes.

3. **Waiting for Third Train:**
   - Time before the third train arrives = 60 minutes (after the second train).
   - Time spent in station = 0 minutes.
   - Total waiting time for the third train = 60 minutes.

4. **Waiting for Fourth Train:**
   - Time before the fourth train arrives = 80 minutes (after the third train).
   - Time spent in station = 0 minutes.
   - Total waiting time for the fourth train = 80 minutes.

Summing up all these times gives us the total waiting time for Paul:

Total waiting time = Waiting for First Train + Waiting for Second Train + Waiting for Third Train + Waiting for Fourth Train
= 30 + 35 + 60 + 80
= 205 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 205 minutes.<|im_end|>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Melanie to save enough toothpicks to complete her project. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of toothpicks needed**: 200
2. **Rate at which Melanie saves toothpicks**:
   - She starts saving toothpicks every time she eats a sandwich.
   - Each sandwich contains \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a toothpick (since there are 4 toothpicks per sandwich).
3. **Number of sandwiches eaten in 12 weeks**:
   - In one week: \( 7 \) days * \( 2 \) sandwiches/day = \( 14 \) sandwiches/week
   - Over 12 weeks: \( 14 \) sandwiches/week * 12 weeks = \( 168 \) sandwiches
   - Total toothpicks from these sandwiches: \( 168 \times \frac{1}{4} \) toothpicks/sandwich = \( 42 \) toothpicks

Since Melanie already has saved 10 toothpicks, we need to find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal.

4. **Additional toothpicks required**:
   - Total needed: 200
   - Toothpicks already saved: 10
   - Additional toothpicks needed: \( 200 - 10 = 190 \)

5. **Time taken to collect 190 toothpicks at the current rate**:
   - Rate: 42 toothpicks / 14 sandwiches
   - Time per 14 sandwiches: \( \frac{14}{42} \) weeks = \( \frac{1}{3} \) weeks

Now, let's calculate how many weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining 190 toothpicks:

\[
\text{Remaining toothpicks} = 190
\]
\[
\text{Time to collect 190 toothpicks} = \frac{190}{42} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ weeks}
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
\frac{190}{42} \approx 4.545 \text{ weeks}
\]
\[
4.545 \times \frac{1}{3} \approx 1.515 \text{ weeks}
\]

Therefore, it will take Melanie approximately **1.515 weeks** to collect the additional toothpicks needed to reach 200.

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the selling price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.
- The original price of the watch is $2000.
- Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.

\[ \text{Selling Price (Mr. Rogers)} = 0.75 \times 2000 \]

Calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price (Mr. Rogers)} = 1500 \]

### Step 2: Determine the selling price Mr. Rogers' friend received.
- Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it.

\[ \text{Selling Price (Friend)} = 1.20 \times 1500 \]

Calculate the selling price:

\[ \text{Selling Price (Friend)} = 1800 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the discount amount in dollars.
- Subtract the selling price from the original price to find the difference.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 2000 - 1800 \]

Calculate the discount:

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 200 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount.
- Divide the discount amount by the original price and multiply by 100%.

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100\% \]

Calculate the percentage discount:

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = 10\% \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

{The final answer is: 10%.}<|im_end|>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs over a period of 4 hours. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the rate of production per spring
- A single spring produces one jellyfish every . seconds.
- There are 60 seconds in a minute, so there are \( \frac{60}{\text{seconds}} = 60 \) intervals in a minute.
- Therefore, a single spring produces \( \frac{1}{60} \) jellyfish per second.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time in minutes for 4 hours
- Since 1 hour has 60 minutes, 4 hours have \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) minutes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 4 hours
- In 240 minutes, one spring will produce \( 240 \times \frac{1}{60} = 4 \) jellyfish.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by all 5 springs in 4 hours
- Each spring produces 4 jellyfish in 4 hours.
- With 5 springs working simultaneously, they will collectively produce \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) jellyfish per 4 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]<|im_end|>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( F \) represent Frankie's score.
   Let \( B \) represent Binkie's score.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   According to the problem statement:
   - Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.
     This can be written as:
       \[ F = 2B + 15 \]
   - Binkie's score is given directly:
       \[ B = 90 \]

3. **Substitute Binkie's Score into the Equation for Frankie:**
   Substitute \( B = 90 \) into the equation \( F = 2B + 15 \):
   \[
   F = 2(90) + 15
   \]

4. **Solve for Frankie's Score:**
   Perform the multiplication first:
   \[
   F = 180 + 15

To solve this problem, let's break down James' journey into steps.

1. **Determine the distance James needs to travel to the store:**
   - James' home is 4 miles away from the store.
   - He walks halfway there first before realizing he forgot something at home and walking back.

2. **Calculate the distance James walked to the store:**
   - Since James walks halfway to the store, we need to find half of the total distance between his home and the store.
   \[
   \text{Distance to store} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{2} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}

   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
- Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas.
- Each bunch contains an average of 0.4 bananas.

\[
\text{Total bananas} = \text{Number of bunches} \times \text{Bananas per bunch}
\]

\[
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \times 0.4 = 4 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if Jenny had purchased individual bananas.
- The price of one banana is $0.80.
- Therefore, the total cost for 4 bananas would be:

\[
\text{Cost per banana} = \$0.80
\]
\[
\text{Total cost (individual)} = \text{Total bananas} \times \text{Cost per banana}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost (individual)} = 4 \times 0.80 = \$3.20
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost if Jenny had purchased bananas in bunches.
- The price of a bunch is $3.00.
- Since Jenny buys 10 bunches, her total cost will be:

\[
\text{Total cost (bunches)} = \text{Number of bunches} \times \text{Price per bunch}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost (bunches)} = 10 \times 3.00 = \$30.00
\]

### Step 4: Determine the savings.
- To find out how much Jenny saved, we subtract the total cost when purchasing bananas in bunches from the total cost when purchasing bananas individually.

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost (individual)} - \text{Total cost (bunches)}
\]

\[
\text{Savings} = 3.20 - 30.00 = -\$26.80
\]

Jenny saved $26.80 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( S \) represent the length of fence that Sam gets.
Let \( H \) represent the length of fence that Harry gets.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know two things from the problem statement:
1. The total length of fence is 100 feet.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

From these, we can write our first equation as:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

And from the second condition, we get:
\[ H = S + 60 \]

### Step 3: Substitute One Equation into Another
Substitute \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( S \)
Now, isolate \( S \):
\[ 2S = 100 - 60 \]
\[ 2S = 40 \]
\[ S = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

### Step 5: Find \( H \)
Using the value of \( S \), we find \( H \):
\[ H = S + 60 \]
\[ H = 20 + 60 \]
\[ H = 80 \]

So, Harry gets 80 feet of fence.

### Step 6: Calculate Leftover Fence for Sam
Since the total fence is 100 feet and both Sam and Harry have taken their shares, the leftover fence for Sam is:
\[ 100 - (H + S) \]
\[ 100 - (80 + 20) \]
\[ 100 - 100 \]
\[ 0 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 0.<|im_end|>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.

We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

\text{Annual Growth Rate} = 2 \text{ inches/year}
\]

Step 2: Use the annual growth rate to calculate the total growth in 13 years.
- Since the crocodile grows at an annual rate of 2 inches, in 13 years it will grow:

\[
\text{Total Growth in 13 Years} = \text{Annual Growth Rate} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]

\[
\text{Total Growth in 13 Years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years}
\]

\[
\text{Total Growth in 13 Years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, if the crocodile continues to grow at its current rate, it will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

The final answer is:
The crocodile will grow **26 inches** in 13 years.<|im_end|>","Crocodile grows 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 inches a year.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bikes Marcel sold in each category (MTB, BMX, and Trekking) and then calculate his earnings based on the prices given for each type.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Determine the number of each type of bike sold:
- **Total bikes sold**: 300
- **Half of the bikes are Trekking**: 
\[ \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

- **15% of the bikes are BMX**:
\[ \text{Number of BMX bikes} = \frac{300 \times 15\%}{100} = \frac{300 \times 0.15}{100} = 4.5 \]
Since the number of bikes must be a whole number, we round down to 4 bikes (as it's not possible to sell a fraction of a bike).

- **Remaining bikes**: 
\[ \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (\text{Number of Trekking bikes} + \text{Number of BMX bikes}) \]
\[ \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (150 + 4) = 300 - 154 = 146 \]

#### 2. Calculate the total revenue from each type of bike:
- **Revenue from Trekking bikes**:
\[ \text{Price per Trekking bike} = \$450 \]
\[ \text{Revenue from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = \$67,500 \]

- **Revenue from BMX bikes**:
\[ \text{Price per BMX bike} = \frac{\$500}{2} = \$250 \]
\[ \text{Revenue from BMX bikes} = 4 \times 250 = \$1,000 \]

- **Revenue from MTB bikes**:
\[ \text{Price per MTB bike} = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Revenue from MTB bikes} = 146 \times 500 = \$73,000 \]

#### 3. Sum up all revenues to find the total earnings:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$67,500 + \$1,000 + \$73,000 = \$141,500 \]

### Conclusion:
Marcel earned a total of $141,500 from selling bicycles during that month.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{141500}
\]<|im_end|>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of bales made per hour by the farmer.
2. Determine the number of bales picked up per hour by the truck.
3. Calculate the total number of bales collected over 6 hours for both the farmer and the truck.
4. Subtract the total number of bales collected from the initial number of bales.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Number of bales made per hour by the farmer
The farmer makes 5 bales every hour.

### Step 2: Number of bales picked up per hour by the truck
The truck picks up 3 bales every hour.

### Step 3: Total number of bales collected over 6 hours
- For the farmer: \(5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}\)
- For the truck: \(3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}\)

Total bales collected over 6 hours:
\[30 \text{ (farmer)} + 18 \text{ (truck)} = 48 \text{ bales}\]

### Step 4: Subtract the total number of bales collected from the initial number of bales
Assuming there were initially enough bales to start with, let's denote the initial number of bales as \(B\).

After 6 hours, the remaining number of bales in the field would be:
\[B - 48\]

Since the question does not specify an initial number of bales, the answer should be expressed in terms of \(B\). Therefore, the final answer is:

How many hours a week , does he spend learning?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of class sessions per week
- A normal student has 6 periods.
- John takes 2 additional classes.

Total class sessions per week = 6 (normal) + 2 (extra) = 8 class sessions.

### Step 2: Determine the duration of one class session
Each class session is 40 minutes long.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent in class per week
- Total class sessions per week = 8.
- Duration of one class session = 40 minutes.

Total time spent in class per week = 8 * 40 minutes = 320 minutes.

### Step 4: Convert the total time spent in class from minutes to hours
There are 60 minutes in an hour.

Total time spent in class per week in hours = 320 / 60 ≈ 5.33 hours.

### Step 5: Calculate the time spent on Saturdays and Sundays
John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class time on Saturdays and Sundays.

Time spent on Saturdays and Sundays = \(\frac{1}{16} \times 320\) minutes.

Convert this time into hours:

\[
\text{Time spent on Saturdays and Sundays} = \frac{320}{16} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since there are two days (Saturday and Sunday), we need to double this amount:

\[
\text{Total time spent on Saturdays and Sundays} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Subtract the time spent in class from the total time available
John also spends some time learning outside of class, which we don't know how much yet. Let’s denote this unknown time as \(x\) minutes.

Total time available per week - Time spent in class = Time spent learning.

\[
(5.33 + x) - 320 = 40
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
5.33 + x = 360 \\
x = 360 - 5.33 \\
x \approx 354.67 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 7: Convert the time spent learning back to hours
\[
\text{Time spent learning per week} = \frac{354.67}{60} \approx 5.91 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is approximately **5.91** hours per week.<|im_end|>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class

That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week
So he spends 1800/60=<<1800/60=30>>30 hours per week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. **Initial Drop**: Nathan drops the ball from the top floor (third-floor) of the mall.
   - The total height of the building can be calculated as follows: 
     \[
     \text{Total Height} = \text{Number of Stories} \times \text{Height per Story}
     \]
     Since there are 3 stories per floor and each story is 24 feet tall, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Height} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **First Bounce**:
   - After hitting the ground, the ball bounces back up to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its original height.
   - Therefore, the height after the first bounce is:
     \[
     \text{Height After First Bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Original Height}
     \]
   - Substituting the value of the total height:
     \[
     \text{Height After First Bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Second Bounce**:
   - On the second bounce, the ball again reaches \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its current height.
   - So, the height after the second bounce will be:
     \[
     \text{Height After Second Bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Height After First Bounce}
     \]
   - Substituting the value of the height after the first bounce:
     \[
     \text{Height After Second Bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 \text{ feet}
     \]

Therefore, the ball goes 32 feet high on its second bounce.

{The final answer is}: 32 feet.<|im_end|>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet

To determine the height of the fourth child, we will follow these steps:

1. **Height of the first child:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.

2. **Height of the second child:**
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   - Calculate the height of the second child:
     \[
     \text{Second Child Height} = 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
     Since there are 12 inches in a foot, convert 6 feet to inches:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]
     Add the additional 2 inches:
     \[
     72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Height of the third child:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - Calculate the height of the third child:
     \[
     \text{Third Child Height} = 74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches}
     \]
     Subtract 5 from 74:
     \[
     74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Height of the fourth child:**
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   - Calculate the height of the fourth child:
     \[
     \text{Fourth Child Height} = 69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches}
     \]
     Add 3 to 69:
     \[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
Since the orchard sells apples in bags of 10, we can find out how many bags were sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

Total number of apples = 2000
Number of apples per bag = 10

Number of bags sold = Total number of apples / Number of apples per bag
Number of bags sold = 2000 / 10
Number of bags sold = 200

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from selling the bags.
We know that each bag was sold for $5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

Price per bag = $5
Number of bags sold = 200

Total earnings = Price per bag × Number of bags sold
Total earnings = $5 × 200
Total earnings = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling all the apples.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of meat eaten:**
   - The T-Rex ate half of a small Triceratops.
   - The T-Rex then left behind enough meat for a pack of Velociraptors to scavenge half of what was left.

2. **Determine how much meat the Velociraptors consumed:**
   - The Velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex.
   - Therefore, the Velociraptors ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining meat.

3. **Calculate the total amount of meat that was eaten:**
   - Let \( M \) be the total amount of meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate.
   - After the T-Rex eats half of the Triceratops, there is \( \frac{M}{2} \) left.
   - The Velociraptors eat half of this remaining amount, so they eat \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{M}{2} = \frac{M}{4} \).

4. **Set up an equation based on the information given:**
   - According to the problem, the Velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate.
   - This means \( \frac{M}{4} = \frac{M}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( \frac{M}{4} = \frac{M}{4} \), which confirms our setup.

5. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - We know that the T-Rex ate half of the Triceratops, leaving \( \frac{M}{2} \) for the Velociraptors.
   - The Velociraptors ate half of this, so \( \frac{M}{4} = \frac{M}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \).
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 270 \text{ kg}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**

Therefore, the number of kilograms of meat on the Triceratops before the T-Rex ate was \(\boxed{270}\).<|im_end|>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost for painting the room, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the area of one wall**
- North and South walls (length = 10 ft, width = 8 ft)
\[ \text{Area of one North or South wall} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls:
\[ \text{Total area for North and South walls} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

- East and West walls (length = 5 ft, width = 8 ft)
\[ \text{Area of one East or West wall} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since there are two such walls:
\[ \text{Total area for East and West walls} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total area to be painted**
\[ \text{Total area} = 160 + 80 = 240 \, \text{square feet} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed**
Each gallon covers 20 square feet.
\[ \text{Number of gallons required} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per gallon}} = \frac{240}{20} = 12 \, \text{gallons} \]

                    question:
                    Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case of 12 sodas and shook 3 of them up. Then she took 1 unshaken soda for herself and left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of sodas initially.
Ellen starts with 12 sodas.

### Step 2: Determine how many sodas are left after shaking.
She shakes 3 sodas, so there are \(12 - 3 = 9\) sodas left.

### Step 3: Determine how many sodas are taken away.
- Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda.
- Her brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.

So, her brother takes \(1 + 2 = 3\) sodas in total.

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining sodas.
After her brother leaves, the number of sodas left is \(9 - 3 = 6\).

### Step 5: Determine the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.
Since her friend only has access to the unshaken sodas (0 out of 3), the probability that they get sprayed with soda from a shaken can is effectively zero because their access to any soda is limited to those not shaken.

### Conclusion:
The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is **zero**.

{The final answer is} 0%<|im_end|>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

                    question:
                    . If two trains depart from a station in ! opposite directions, and one train is traveling 60 miles an hour while the other is traveling half that distance per hour, how far apart are they from each other : after 3 hours?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between the two trains after 3 hours given their different speeds.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the speeds of the trains:**
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the distance covered by each train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance covered by the first train in 3 hours: 
     \[
     \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed}_1 \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance covered by the second train in 3 hours:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed}_2 \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the total distance between the two trains:**
   Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer:
After 3 hours, the two trains are {270 miles} apart.<|im_end|>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Billy volunteers**

- **March has 31 days**
- Billy takes 20% off from March 1st to April 19th.
  
  - Number of days from March 1st to March 31st = 31 days
  - Total volunteer days before taking off = 31 days
  
  - Days left after taking off = 31 days * 80% = 24.8 days ≈ 25 days (since we can't have a fraction of a day)

  **Total volunteer days = 31 + 25 = 56 days**

**Step 2: Determine how much time Billy spends helping each day**

- Billy works 2 hours per day.
- He can help 2 people per hour.

  **Time spent helping per day = 2 hours/day × 2 people/hour = 4 person-hours/day**

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people helped over the entire period**

- Total volunteer days = 56 days
- Time spent helping each day = 4 person-hours/day

  **Total person-hours worked = 56 days × 4 person-hours/day = 224 person-hours**

**Step 4: Calculate the number of people Billy helps**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour.
- Total person-hours worked = 224 person-hours

  **Number of people helped = 224 person-hours / 2 people/hour = 112 people**

Therefore, Billy helps **112 people** during the period from March 1st to April 19th.<|im_end|>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

To determine how many people were inside the church after the wedding ceremony, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of vehicles**: 
   - Private cars: 20
   - Buses: 12
   
2. **Number of passengers per vehicle**:
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - Each car carries 3 people.

First, calculate the total number of people who boarded the buses:
\[ \text{Total people in buses} = 12 \times 35 \]

Next, calculate the total number of people who boarded the cars:
\[ \text{Total people in cars} = 20 \times 3 \]

Now, sum these to find the total number of people who boarded all vehicles:
\[ \text{Total people} = (12 \times 35) + (20 \times 3) \]

Perform the multiplications:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Add these results together:

To determine the total number of hours Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the daily time spent on lunches.
- Lunch duration: 30 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate the daily time spent on breaks.
- Breaks: Bobby has 2 breaks, each lasting 15 minutes.
- Total break time = \(2 \times 15\) minutes.

Let's calculate this:
\[
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the total daily time spent on both lunches and breaks.
\[
30 \text{ (lunch)} + 30 \text{ (breaks)} = 60 \text{ minutes}

To determine Sheila's new credit card balance after all transactions, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial charge
Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

### Step 2: Subtract the return amount
She returned an item that cost $15.00.
\[ \text{New total} = \$85.00 - \$15.00 = \$70.00 \]

### Step 3: Add the purchase from the frying pan
The frying pan was sold at a 20% discount off its original price of $20.00.
\[ \text{Discounted price of frying pan} = \$20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$20.00 \times 0.80 = \$16.00 \]
After purchasing this item, the new total becomes:
\[ \text{New total} = \$70.00 + \$16.00 = \$86.00 \]

### Step 4: Add the purchase from the towel set
The towel set was sold at a 10% discount off its original price of $30.00.
\[ \text{Discounted price of towel set} = \$30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$30.00 \times 0.90 = \$27.00 \]
After purchasing this item as well, the new total becomes:
\[ \text{New total} = \$86.00 + \$27.00 = \$113.00 \]

### Final Answer:
The new balance on her credit card is $\boxed{\$113.00}$.

Note: The term ""set"" in the context might refer to multiple items being purchased together or just one item costing more than once. If it refers to the latter, then only the towel set would be added, not the frying pan since it was already included in the initial charge.<|im_end|>","She charged $85.00 on her card and just returned a $15.00 purchase so right now, her credit card has 85-15 = $<<85-15=70.00>>70.00 balance

                    question:
                    A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in ! it. A : fifth of the jellyfish are , large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV ; light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. ; How many jellyfish ; are ? in the tank?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of jellyfish**: We need to find out how many jellyfish there are.

2. **Fraction of large jellyfish that change color**:
   - It states that a third of the large jellyfish change color.
   
3. **Number of large jellyfish that change color**: This is given as 6 jellyfish.

4. **Fraction of large jellyfish**: 
   - Since one-third of the large jellyfish change color, we can set up an equation to find the total number of large jellyfish (L).

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times L = 6 \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - To isolate \( L \), multiply both sides by 3:

\[ L = 6 \times 3 \]
\[ L = 18 \]

So, there are 18 large jellyfish.

6. **Fraction of jellyfish that are large**:  
   - Since a fifth of all jellyfish are large, we know:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times T = \text{number of large jellyfish} \]

7. **Set up another equation**:
   - Substitute \( L \) into the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times T = 18 \]

8. **Solve for \( T \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 5:

\[ T = 18 \times 5 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Therefore, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( \boxed{90} \).<|im_end|>","A third of the large jellyfish change color, so there are 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 large jellyfish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lauren needs to save annually and then calculate how long it will take her to reach her savings goal.

### Step 1: Calculate Lauren's Annual Savings Goal

Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck. Let's denote her current annual salary as \( S \).

- Current Salary (S) = $100,000
- Percentage saved per year = 20%

First, let's find out how much Lauren saves each year:

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = S \times \text{Percentage Saved}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = \$100,000 \times 0.20
\]

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = \$20,000
\]

So, Lauren saves $20,000 annually.

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount Needed in Retirement

Lauren wants to save enough over 20 years to cover her retirement. She aims to save 40% of her current annual salary.

- Current Salary (S) = $100,000
- Desired percentage saved = 40%
- Number of years = 20

Calculate the total amount needed in retirement:

\[
\text{Total Amount Needed} = S \times \text{Desired Percentage}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total Amount Needed} = \$100,000 \times 0.40
\]

\[
\text{Total Amount Needed} = \$40,000
\]

So, Lauren needs to save a total of $40,000 over 20 years.

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Years Required

Now, we know that Lauren saves $20,000 each year. To find out how many years it will take her to accumulate $40,000, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Number of Years} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Needed}}{\text{Annual Savings}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Number of Years} = \frac{\$40,000}{\$20,000}
\]

\[
\text{Number of Years} = 2
\]

So, Lauren needs to work for 2 years to save up enough for her retirement.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\boxed{2}<|im_end|>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine how many centimeters make up one part**

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He needs to divide this into 4 equal parts.

\[ \text{Length per part} = \frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Number of parts}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Length per part} = \frac{100\, \text{cm}}{4} = 25\, \text{cm} \]

**Step 2: Divide each part into 5 equal smaller pieces**

Now we have 4 equal parts, and each part needs to be divided into 5 equal smaller pieces.

\[ \text{Smaller length per part} = \frac{\text{Length per part}}{\text{Number of smaller parts}} \]

Since there are 4 parts:

\[ \text{Smaller length per part} = \frac{25\, \text{cm}}{5} = 5\, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, the length of each final cut (which is now divided into 5 equal parts) is **5 cm**.<|im_end|>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We know that 40% of the total student population is composed of boys.
   - This 40% corresponds to 240 boys.

2. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   Let \( T \) represent the total number of students in the school. Since 40% of the total population is boys, we can write:
   \[
   0.40 \times T = 240
   \]

3. **Solve for \( T \):**
   To find the total number of students, divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
   \[
   T = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600
   \]
   So, there are 600 students in total in the school.

4. **Determine the percentage of girls in the school:**
   The remaining 60% of the population must be girls because the entire population is either boys or girls (since only one group can make up the whole school). Therefore, the percentage of girls is:
   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of girls in the school:**
   Finally, calculate the number of girls using the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360
   \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of girls in the school is:
{The final answer is}
360.<|im_end|>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of women at the party.
2. Calculate the total number of women wearing 4-inch heels.
3. Calculate the total number of women wearing 2-inch heels.
4. Find the total number of women.
5. Calculate the total number of women who are not wearing any heels (if applicable).
6. Compute the average height based on the total number of women.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Total Number of Women:**
   Let's denote the total number of women as \( W \).

2. **Women Wearing 4-inch Heels:**
   We know that three out of the women are wearing 4-inch heels. Therefore, the number of women wearing 4-inch heels is \( 3W/3 = W \).

3. **Women Wearing 2-inch Heels:**
   We also know that there are three women wearing 2-inch heels. So, the number of women wearing 2-inch heels is \( 3W/3 = W \).

4. **Total Number of Women:**
   Since all women have either 4-inch or 2-inch heels, the total number of women \( W \) must be equal to the sum of those two groups. Hence,
   \[
   W = W + W
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2W = 6 \quad \text{(since } W = 6\text{)}
   \]

5. **Calculate Average Height:**
   The average height can be calculated using the formula for the mean:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Sum of heights}}{\text{Number of people}}
   \]
   Substituting the given numbers:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{4 \times 3W + 2 \times 3W}{6}
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{12W + 6W}{6} = \frac{18W}{6} = 3W
   \]

Since \( W = 6 \), substitute back into the equation:
\[
\text{Average height} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is **18 inches**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of inches from the 4-inch heels: 3 women * 4 inches/woman = <<3*4=12>>12 inches
Then find the total number of inches from the 2-inch heels: 3 women * 2 inches/woman = <<3*2=6>>6 inches
Then add the total number of inches from each group of heels to find the overall total: 12 inches + 6 inches = <<12+6=18>>18 inches
Then find the total number of women at the party: 3 women + 3 women = <<3+3=6>>6 women
Then divide the total number of heel inches by the number of women to find the average heel height per woman: 18 inches / 6 women = <<18/6=3>>3 inches / woman

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike to meet her goal, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total miles Soledad aims to hike:**
   - She plans to hike 9,300 miles.

2. **Determine the number of hikes she intends to do:**
   - She walks every other day.
   - Since there are 30 days in June, she will go on 15 hikes (since \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)).

3. **Calculate total distance covered per hike:**
   - Each hike covers 125 miles.

4. **Calculate total distance Soledad would cover if she does all planned hikes:**
   \[
   15 \text{ hikes} \times 125 \text{ miles/hike} = 1875 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Compare this distance to her goal:**
   - Her goal is 9,300 miles.
   - She will only achieve 1875 miles.

6. **Determine the remaining distance she still needs to hike:**
   \[
   9,300 \text{ miles} - 1875 \text{ miles} = 7,425 \text{ miles}
   \]

7. **Divide the remaining distance by the number of hikes to find out how much additional hiking Soledad needs to do per day:**
   - She wants to hike twice a day.
   \[
   \frac{7,425 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ hikes}} = 501.67 \text{ miles/hike}
   \]

So, Soledad needs to hike approximately 501.67 miles per hike to reach her goal. To summarize:

- **Total miles Soledad aims to hike:** 9,300 miles
- **Number of hikes she intends to do:** 15 hikes
- **Distance per hike:** 125 miles
- **Remaining distance:** 7,425 miles

                    Raymond had $21. Then he saved ! $11 from his allowance and ; spent ! $5 on a comic book and $19 on : a ? puzzle. How much money does , Raymond ? have left?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount**: Raymond starts with $21.
2. **Saving allowance**: He saves $11 from his allowance.
3. **Spending comic book**: He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. **Spending puzzle**: We don't know how much he spends on the puzzle yet.

Let's go through the calculations:

### Step 1: Initial Amount
Raymond starts with $21.

### Step 2: Saving Allowance
He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.
\[ \text{Total after saving} = \$21 + \$11 = \$32 \]

### Step 3: Spending Comic Book
He spends $5 on a comic book.
\[ \text{Remaining after buying comic book} = \$32 - \$5 = \$27 \]

### Step 4: Spent Puzzle (Unknown)
We still don't know how much he spends on the puzzle. Let's denote the cost of the puzzle as \( x \).

So far, the total spent on everything can be represented as:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$5 + x \]

### Final Calculation
Since we only have information about the comic book purchase so far, let's assume that all other expenses are covered by the remaining funds.

Given that we don't have enough information to determine the exact amount spent on the puzzle, we cannot calculate the final amount Raymond has without knowing \( x \). Therefore, the final amount Raymond has left depends on the value of \( x \), which we do not have sufficient information to determine.

However, if we were to express it in terms of \( x \):
- The total spent would be \( \$5 + x \).
- The remaining amount would then be:
\[ \$27 - (\$5 + x) = \$22 - x \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent so far.
Anna started with a budget of $16 and has already spent $4 on something else. Let's subtract that from her initial budget:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$16 - \$4 = \$12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget after buying the two books.
Anna has $2 left in her budget. This means we need to add back the $2 she has left to the $12 she has already spent:
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = \$2 + \$12 = \$14 \]

### Step 3: Divide the remaining budget by the number of books purchased.
Anna has bought 2 books and spent all but $2. So, if we divide the remaining budget by the number of books (which is 2), we get the cost per book:
\[ \text{Cost per book} = \frac{\$14}{2} = \$7 \]

Therefore, each book costs Anna **\$7**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The books cost Anna **\$7 each**.<|im_end|>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.

Therefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are currently enrolled in the calligraphy class based on last year's enrollment and an increase of 20%.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of students last year:**
   - According to the information provided, there were 50 students last year.

2. **Calculate the increase in enrollment for this year:**
   - The problem states that there was a 20% increase from last year to this year.
   
3. **Convert the percentage increase into a numerical value:**
   - To find out how much more students there will be this year compared to last year, multiply the number of students from last year (50) by 20% (or 0.20).
   
4. **Perform the calculation:**
   \[
   50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]
   So, there will be an additional 10 students this year.

5. **Add the increased number to last year's total:**
   - Add the 10 additional students to last year's enrollment (50 students).

6. **Final calculation:**
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the light on the lighthouse to blink 459 times given that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

Step 1: Determine the blinking rate.
- We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
- Therefore, the blinking rate can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Blinking Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Blinks}}{\text{Time (in minutes)}} \]
\[ \text{Blinking Rate} = \frac{255}{5} \]

Step 2: Simplify the calculation.
\[ \text{Blinking Rate} = 51 \text{ times per minute} \]

Step 3: Calculate the time required for 459 blinks using the blinking rate.
- Let \( T \) be the total time required for 459 blinks.
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Number of Blinks}}{\text{Blinking Rate}} \]
\[ T = \frac{459}{51} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ T = \frac{459}{51} \approx 9 \]

Therefore, it will take approximately 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

To determine how many more female fish Tate has compared to male fish, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of male and female fish in the garden pond**

- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Step 2: Determine the total number of additional male and female fish added**

- Additional male guppies: 2
- Additional female guppies: 1
- Additional male goldfishes: 2
- Additional female goldfishes: 3

**Step 3: Sum up the initial numbers and add the additional ones**

- Initial male guppies + Additional male guppies = 4 + 2 = 6 (male guppies)
- Initial female guppies + Additional female guppies = 7 + 1 = 8 (female guppies)

Now we know:
- Total male guppies = 6
- Total female guppies = 8

For the goldfishes:
- Initial male goldfishes + Additional male goldfishes = 3 + 2 = 5 (male goldfishes)
- Total female goldfishes = 5

So now we have:
- Total male goldfishes = 5
- Total female goldfishes = 8

**Step 4: Compare the totals of female and male fish**

- Number of female fish = 8
- Number of male fish = 6

Finally, calculate the difference between the number of female and male fish:

\[ \text{Difference} = 8 - 6 = 2 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long each individual spent on their assigned task and then sum those times.

1. **Calculate the time Megan spent walking the dog:**
   - Amalia's time for mowing the lawn = 4 hours
   - Megan's time for walking the dog = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours

2. **Calculate the time Dior spent doing laundry:**
   - Amalia's time for mowing the lawn = 4 hours
   - Dior’s time for doing laundry = 4 hours + (4 hours * x) where x > 1 because it takes more than 4 hours
   Let \(x\) be the number of hours beyond 4 hours that Dior spends on laundry. Since \(x > 1\), let \(x = 2\) (a reasonable estimate for simplicity):
   \[
   \text{Dior's time} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours}

3. **Sum up the total time spent on chores:**
   - Time spent by Amalia = 4 hours
   - Time spent by Megan = 6 hours
   - Time spent by Dior = 6 hours

   Adding these together gives us the total time spent on chores:

\[

   - The average speed on the road is given as 70 mph.

2. **Use the formula for distance:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine Sofie's daily walking distance**
- We know that Sofie walks twice as far as Brian in one day.
- Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, this means she walks twice her planned distance.

\[ \text{Sofie's daily distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's daily distance} \]

Since Sofie walks 10 miles per day, we can set up the equation:
\[ 10 = 2 \times \text{Brian's daily distance} \]

Solving for Brian's daily distance:
\[ \text{Brian's daily distance} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Brian walks 5 miles every day.

**Step 2: Calculate Brian's total walking distance over 7 days**

Now that we have determined Brian's daily walking distance, we can calculate his total distance walked in 7 days.

\[ \text{Total distance Brian walks} = \text{Brian's daily distance} \times \text{number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance Brian walks} = 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance Brian walks} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total number of toys needed:**
   The order requires 400 toys.

2. **Determine how many toys have already been produced:**
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
     - 2 * 6 = 12 toys per hour.
   - Another 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
     - 2 * 4 = 8 toys per hour.
   
   Combined, they produce:
     (2 * 6) + (2 * 4) = 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

3. **Total production so far:**
   - Total production rate: 20 toys/hour.
   - Number of hours worked: 10 hours.
     - Total production = 20 * 10 = 200 toys.

4. **Calculate remaining toys needed:**
   - Total toys needed: 400.
   - Toys already produced: 200.
     - Remaining toys needed = 400 - 200 = 200 toys.

5. **Determine how many more toys need to be produced in the last hour:**
   - Since we need exactly 20 toys to complete the order, we'll assume the 5th worker can produce this exact amount.

Therefore, the 5th worker must produce 20 toys per hour to meet the requirement at the end of the shift.

**Final Answer:** The fifth worker produces 20 toys per hour.<|im_end|>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

                    Elijah has one dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog and another dog that is half the weight of Kory’s dog. If ? Kory’s dog is 60 pounds, how much do Elijah and Kory’s dogs weigh altogether, in pounds?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the weights of Elijah's dogs:**
   - Let \( E_1 \) be the weight of Elijah's first dog.
   - Let \( E_2 \) be the weight of Elijah's second dog.

2. **Relate the weights to Kory's dog:**
   - According to the problem, Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
     Therefore, \( E_1 = \frac{1}{4}K \).
   - The problem also states that Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog.
     Therefore, \( E_2 = \frac{1}{2}K \).

3. **Use the given information about Kory's dog:**
   - We know that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds (\( K = 60 \)).

4. **Calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs using the value of \( K \):**
   - Substitute \( K = 60 \) into the equations for \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):
     \[
     E_1 = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
     \]
     \[
     E_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Sum the weights of Elijah's dogs:**
   - Add \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):
     \[
     E_1 + E_2 = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Elijah and Kory's dogs together weigh 45 pounds. Thus, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 45 pounds.<|im_end|>","Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information provided.

1. **Kris's Stickers**: Kris kept 9 out of every 10 stickers he received.
   - If Kris has 7 stickers left after giving some to Rob, then he must have received \(7 \times 10 = 70\) stickers initially.

2. **Rob's Stickers**: The 7 stickers that Kris gave to Rob were one part of those 70 stickers.
   - Therefore, Rob originally had \(7 \times 2 = 14\) stickers before receiving them from Kris.

3. **Luis's Stickers**: Luis gave away stickers such that what remained was 7 stickers.
   - This means Luis had \(7 + 7 = 14\) stickers initially.

4. **Luis's Second Distribution**: Luis used half of these 14 stickers and gave the other half to Seth.
   - So, Luis started with \(14 \times 2 = 28\) stickers.

5. **Seth's Stickers**: Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Since Seth ended up with 7 stickers (after giving some to Luis), it means he started with \(7 \times 2 = 14\) stickers.

Therefore, the number of stickers Seth had at the beginning was \(\boxed{14}\).<|im_end|>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.

To determine how many small bags John can make, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the large bags**
- Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
- John buys 3 large bags.

\[ \text{Total weight} = 3 \times 10 \, \text{ounces} = 30 \, \text{ounces} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of M&Ms per ounce**
- There are 30 M&Ms per ounce.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of M&Ms in all large bags combined**
\[ \text{Total M&Ms} = 30 \, \text{ounces} \times 30 \, \text{M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \, \text{M&Ms} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many small bags can be made given that each small bag contains 10 M&Ms**
\[ \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{\text{Total M&Ms}}{\text{M&Ms per small bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Therefore, John can make **90 small bags**.<|im_end|>","He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 ounces of M&M

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total distance Alfie needs to cover:**
   - The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.
   - We need to find half of that distance.
   
2. **Calculate half of the Earth's circumference:**
   \[
   \text{Half of the Earth's circumference} = \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days it takes for Alfie to fly this distance:**
   - Alfie flies 400 kilometers per day.
   - To find out how many days he needs to travel 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flight distance.
   
4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days}

<|im_start|>user

To determine how fast the faster car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the second fastest car:**
   - We know that the second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
   - The average car can go at 120 miles per hour.

   \[
   \text{Speed of second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of average car}

2. **Determine the speed of the faster car:**
   - The faster car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.
   - From Step 1, we have determined that the second fastest car goes at 600 mph.

   \[
   \text{Speed of faster car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of second fastest car}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how old Vince is currently based on the information provided about Liam's age.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince.

2. **Calculate Liam's Age Two Years Ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Therefore, two years ago, Liam would have been \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

3. **Set Up the Equation Based on the Problem Statement:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age (14) was twice Vince’s age at that time.
   
   Mathematically, if \(L\) represents Liam’s current age, then \(V\) represents Vince’s current age, we can write:
   \[
   L - 2 = 2(V - 2)
   \]

4. **Substitute Known Values into the Equation:**
   - Substitute \(L = 16\) into the equation:
   \[
   16 - 2 = 2(V - 2)
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   14 = 2(V - 2)
   \]

5. **Solve for Vince's Current Age:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \(V\):
   \[
   7 = V - 2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides to solve for \(V\):
   \[
   V = 9
   \]

Therefore, Vince is currently 9 years old.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} Vince is currently 9 years old.<|im_end|>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

                    question:
                    Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many : more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of eggs each person painted:

- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs that Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs that Madeline painted.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs that Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs that Sarah painted.

From the information given in the problem, we can set up the following equations:

1. The total number of eggs painted is 56:
\[ A + M + C + S = 56 \]

2. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs:
\[ A = M \]

3. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ C + S = 30 \]

4. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah:
\[ C = S + 12 \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions from equations (2), (3), and (4) into equation (1):

Substitute \( M = A \) into equation (1):
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

Next, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into equation (1):
\[ 2A + (S + 12) + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + S + 12 + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know from equation (3) that \( C = S + 12 \). Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into the simplified equation for \( A + S \):
\[ A + S = 22 \]

Since \( A = M \) and \( M = A \), it follows that \( A = M \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]<|im_end|>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - Nik wants to separate his 200 crayons into groups of 8.
   - To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of crayons by the number per box:
     \[
     \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ boxes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons:**
   - Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
   - Since there are 200 crayons, the total weight of the crayons is:
     \[
     200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes:**
   - Each box weighs 8 ounces.
   - With 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:
     \[
     25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Add the weights together:**
   - The total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.
   - The total weight of the boxes is also 200 ounces.
   - Therefore, the combined total weight is:
     \[
     200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces}
     \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:**
   - There are 16 ounces in one pound.
   - To convert 400 ounces to pounds, we divide by 16:
     \[
     \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is \( \boxed{25} \) pounds.<|im_end|>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of wood John gets from cutting down the tree.
John has an 80-foot tree.

- The tree's length = 80 feet.

### Step 2: Determine how many pieces (logs) John can get from the tree.
He wants to cut the tree into 4-foot logs.

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Total Length}}{\text{Log Length}} \]

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \]

So, John can cut the tree into 20 logs.

### Step 3: Determine how many logs he makes after accounting for the percentage that cannot be used.
John can only use 80% of the log.

\[ \text{Logs usable} = \text{Total Logs} \times 0.8 \]
\[ \text{Logs usable} = 20 \times 0.8 = 16 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many planks come from these logs.
Each log is cut into 5 planks.

\[ \text{Planks per log} = 5 \]

Since there are 16 logs,

\[ \text{Total Planks} = \text{Logs usable} \times \text{Planks per Log} \]
\[ \text{Total Planks} = 16 \times 5 = 80 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the revenue generated from selling the planks.
Each plank is sold for $1.2.

\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Total Planks} \times \text{Price per Plank} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, John makes $96 from selling the planks.

\[
\boxed{96}
\]<|im_end|>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.

Valerie's brother earns half of what Valerie earns.
- Brother's earnings = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \$5000 \)

\[
\text{Brother's earnings} = \$2500
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the combined earnings of Valerie and her brother**

- Combined earnings = Val's earnings + Bro's earnings

\[
\text{Combined earnings} = \$5000 + \$2500
\]

\[
\text{Combined earnings} = \$7500
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the mother's earnings**

The mother earns twice as much as the combined earnings of Valerie and her brother.
- Mother's earnings = \( 2 \times \$7500 \)

\[
\text{Mother's earnings} = \$15000
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money they all have together**

- Total amount = Mother's earnings + Their combined earnings

\[
\text{Total amount} = \$15000 + \$7500

\[
\text{Total amount} = \$22500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total distance walked**: 3 miles.
2. **Distance on beach**: 2 miles.
3. **Distance on sidewalk**: 1 mile.
4. **Time spent on beach**: 40 minutes.

We need to determine the total time taken to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate the remaining distance after walking on the beach:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance on beach} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 3 \text{ miles} - 2 \text{ miles} = 1 \text{ mile} \]

#### 2. Determine the ratio of speeds on the beach vs. sidewalk:
Since Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk compared to the beach,
\[ \text{Speed on beach} = v \]
\[ \text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2v \]

#### 3. Calculate the time taken to walk on the beach:
\[ \text{Time on beach} = \frac{\text{Distance on beach}}{\text{Speed on beach}} \]
\[ \text{Time on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v} \]

Given that 40 minutes is spent on the beach:
\[ \frac{2}{v} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]
Solving for \( v \):
\[ \frac{2}{v} = \frac{40}{60} \]
\[ \frac{2}{v} = \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ v = 3 \text{ miles per minute} \]

#### 4. Calculate the time taken to walk on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{\text{Distance on sidewalk}}{\text{Speed on sidewalk}} \]
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2v} \]
Substituting \( v = 3 \text{ miles per minute} \):
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times 3 \text{ miles per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ minutes} \approx 0.167 \text{ minutes} \]

#### 5. Calculate the total time to complete the entire walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ minutes} \]
Convert 40 minutes to hours:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} \]
So, the total time in hours is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} \]
Find a common denominator (6) and add them:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{4}{6} \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours} \]
Convert back to minutes:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{5}{6} \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time taken for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is \(\boxed{50}\) minutes.<|im_end|>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jane saves per week and then calculate how many more weeks it would take her to reach a total savings goal of $60.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Jane's weekly saving amount:**
   - Jane has saved a total of $4 over 8 weeks.
   - To find out how much she saves per week, divide the total amount saved by the number of weeks:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = \frac{\$4}{8 \text{ weeks}} = \$0.50 \text{ per week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of additional weeks needed to reach $60:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional weeks required.
   - Since Jane saves $0.50 per week, after \( x \) weeks, she will have saved an additional amount equal to:
     \[
     0.50x \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The total savings after \( x \) weeks should be $60:
     \[
     4 + 0.50x = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     0.50x = 60 - 4
     \]
     \[
     0.50x = 56
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{56}{0.50}
     \]
     \[
     x = 112
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take Jane 112 more weeks to save a total of $60 if she continues to save at the same rate.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{112}
\]<|im_end|>","She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.

- There are 2 such trees.
\[ \text{Total blue birds} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue birds in the remaining tree.
- This tree has 3 blue birds.
\[ \text{Total blue birds} = 14 + 3 = 17 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of marbles Bob has.
- Let \( x \) be the initial number of marbles Bob has.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles after receiving 2 dozen more.
- Since one dozen equals 12, 2 dozen would equal \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).
- After receiving these additional marbles, Bob will have \( x + 24 \) marbles.

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.
- According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles.
- Therefore, we can write the equation: 
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \), the initial number of marbles Bob had.
- Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, initially, Bob had 36 marbles.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of marbles after losing 10 marbles.
- If Bob loses 10 marbles, his new total would be:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 26 marbles.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Donny can only drink water when its temperature is at least 40 degrees.
   - He has two mugs of water.
   - One mug (mug A) contains 33 degrees.
   - The other mug (mug B) is unknown.

2. **Water Transfer Process:**
   - Donny pours 4 ounces of water from mug A into his water bottle.
   - Then he takes 1 ounce from mug B and adds it to his water bottle.

3. **Final Condition for Drinking Water:**
   - After these transfers, Donny can drink the water in his water bottle because the temperature is at least 40 degrees.

4. **Temperature Analysis Before Final Transfers:**
   - Since mug A is 33 degrees and mug B is unknown, we need to determine if it's possible that mug B could have been warmer than or equal to 40 degrees before any transfer.

5. **Temperature Calculation:**
   - Let \( T_B \) represent the temperature of mug B.
   - We know that after transferring 4 ounces from mug A to the water bottle, the total volume of water in the water bottle will be 7 ounces (4 + 1 = 5), but we don't care about the total volume yet; we're interested in the temperature condition.

6. **Condition Check:**
   - For Donny to be able to drink the water in the water bottle, the water must be at least 40 degrees.
   - This means that the temperature of the transferred water from mug A plus the unknown temperature of mug B should not exceed 40 degrees.

7. **Equation Setup:**
   - Let \( T_A \) be the temperature of mug A initially.
   - Let \( T_B \) be the initial temperature of mug B.
   - Temperature of transferred water from mug A: \( T_A - x \)
   - Total temperature in the water bottle after transfer: \( (T_A - x) + (T_B - y) \)

8. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   - We know \( T_A = 33 \) degrees.
   - Let’s assume the final temperature in the water bottle is exactly 40 degrees (since that's the minimum threshold for drinking).

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - \( (33 - x) + (T_B - y) = 40 \)
   - Simplify further: \( 33 - x + T_B - y = 40 \)
   - Rearrange: \( 33 + T_B - x - y = 40 \)
   - Simplify more: \( 33 + T_B - x - y = 40 \)
   - So, \( T_B - x - y = 7 \)
   - Given \( x = 1 \): \( T_B - 1 - y = 7 \)
   - Therefore, \( T_B - y = 8 \)

10. **Conclusion:**
    - To ensure Donny can drink the water, mug B cannot be hotter than 40 degrees minus 1 degree, which is 39 degrees. Thus, mug B must be at least 39 degrees.

**Final Answer:** At least 39 degrees is the temperature of mug B.<|im_end|>","There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5

   - Melanie starts with 50 cows.
   - She also has 20 chickens.

2. **Cows Addition Over Three Weeks:**
   - Milkie Cows (Limited) brings in 20 cows per day.
   - For three weeks (21 days), they add 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows to the farm.

3. **Chickens Addition Over Three Weeks:**
   - Broilers bring in 10 chickens per day.
   - For three weeks (21 days), they add 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens to the farm.

4. **Total Number of Animals After Three Weeks:**
   - Start with 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals.
   - Add the 420 cows brought in over three weeks.
   - Add the 210 chickens brought in over three weeks.
   - Calculate the total: 70 (initial) + 420 (cows added) + 210 (chicks added) = 700 total animals on the farm.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bagels Russell receives.
Russell orders 4 packs of bagels at $10.00 per pack.

\[
\text{Total cost for 4 packs} = 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Each pack contains 9 bagels.

\[
\text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the price per bagel after applying the 10% discount.
First, find the original price of all 36 bagels without any discount.

\[
\text{Original price for 36 bagels} = 36 \times \$10.00 = \$360.00
\]

Next, apply the 10% discount to the original price.

\[
\text{Discount amount} = \$360.00 \times 0.10 = \$36.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price:

\[
\text{Final price} = \$360.00 - \$36.00 = \$324.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per single bagel.
Now, divide the final price by the total number of bagels (which we already know is 36).

\[
\text{Cost per single bagel} = \frac{\$324.00}{36} = \$9.00
\]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops.

- Number of scoops Gomer ate = \( 23 - 5 \)

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of potatoes needed to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

- Number of potatoes per scoop = \( 6 - 3 \)

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer needs for 18 scoops.
Total number of potatoes needed = \( 18 \) scoops × \( 3 \) potatoes per scoop

\[ 18 \times 3 = 54 \]

So, Gomer needs 54 potatoes in total.

### Conclusion
Therefore, Gomer ate **54** potatoes.<|im_end|>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

- Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
- Over 30 days, he consumes \(3 \times 30 = 90\) eggs.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in the next 30 days after increasing his consumption.
- Chester now eats 5 eggs per day.
- Over 30 days, he consumes \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs.

### Step 3: Add the two quantities together to find the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the number of blue jellybeans, let's break down the information given:

1. **Identify the number of green jellybeans**: There are 17 green jellybeans.

2. **Calculate the number of red jellybeans**: According to the problem, there are twice as many red jellybeans as green ones. Therefore, we multiply the number of green jellybeans by 2.
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 17 \times 2 = 34
   \]

3. **Sum the total number of green and red jellybeans**: Add the number of green and red jellybeans together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
   \]

4. **Determine the number of blue jellybeans**: Since the total number of jellybeans is 60, we subtract the sum of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is \boxed{9}.<|im_end|>","There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total parts in the ratio**:
   - The given ratio of men to women is 5:9.
   - This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Calculate the total number of parts**:
   - Add the numbers in the ratio together: \(5 + 9 = 14\).

3. **Find out how many people make up one part**:
   - Divide the total number of passengers (84) by the total number of parts (14): \(\frac{84}{14} = 6\).
     - So, each part represents 6 people.

4. **Calculate the number of women initially on the bus**:
   - Multiply the number of parts representing women (9) by the number of people per part (6): \(9 \times 6 = 54\).
     - Initially, there were 54 women on the bus.

5. **Subtract the number of women who alighted**:
   - Subtract the number of women who alighted (20) from the initial number of women: \(54 - 20 = 34\).
     - After some women alighted, 34 women remain on the bus.

Therefore, the final answer is {The number of women remaining on the bus is 34}.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of women on the bus is 5+9=<<5+9=14>>14

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sunflowers sold in total over three days.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate daily earnings for sunflowers:**
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{\text{Daily earnings}}{\text{Cost per sunflower}} 
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

2. **Calculate total earnings for sunflowers over 3 days:**
   - Each day, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers.
   - Over 3 days, he would sell \( 13 \times 3 = 39 \) sunflowers.

3. **Calculate daily earnings for bouquets:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earns $56 per day from selling bouquets.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{\text{Daily earnings}}{\text{Cost per bouquet}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
   \]

4. **Calculate total earnings for bouquets over 3 days:**
   - Each day, Faraday sells 7 bouquets.
   - Over 3 days, he would sell \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) bouquets.

5. **Calculate total earnings (sunflowers + bouquets):**
   - Total earnings from sunflowers = $26 per day × 3 days = $78.
   - Total earnings from bouquets = $56 per day × 3 days = $168.
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from sunflowers} + \text{Earnings from bouquets}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 78 + 168 = 246
   \]

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell a total of:

\[
\boxed{39 \text{ sunflowers}}
\]<|im_end|>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.

The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down Adam's situation into steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of opening the rock stand:**
   - Adam needs $100 to open the rock stand.

2. **Calculate the profit per unit sold:**
   - Selling price = $7
   - Cost price = $5
   - Profit per unit = Selling price - Cost price = $7 - $5 = $2

3. **Calculate the number of units that need to be sold to cover the initial investment:**
   - Total cost of the rock stand = $100
   - Number of units needed to cover the cost = Total cost / Profit per unit = $100 / $2 = 50 units

4. **Calculate the actual amount of money Adam actually spends on selling these units:**
   - Since he invests all his money ($100) in the rock stand,
     - Amount spent on selling 60% of his inventory = 60% of 50 units * $5/unit = 0.6 * 50 * $5 = $150

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the inventory:**
   - Actual amount spent on inventory = $150
   - Revenue from selling 60% of the inventory = (60/100) * Total revenue = (60/100) * $7/unit * Number of units sold
   - Let x be the number of units sold.
   - Revenue = (60/100) * $7 * x

6. **Set up an equation to find out if Adam made a loss or gain:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from selling 60% of the inventory + Amount left in the bank after buying the inventory.
   - Revenue = (60/100) * $7 * x + $100 - $150

Let's simplify further:
- Revenue = (60/100) * $7 * x - $50

Now we know Adam invested $100 in the rock stand, so if he makes a loss, it means the revenue is less than $100. We need to calculate the exact amount lost:

- Loss = Revenue - $100

After solving this equation, you'll find the amount of money Adam loses. However, without knowing the exact number of units sold (x), we cannot determine the exact loss. But the process above shows how to set up the equations and understand the relationship between the numbers involved. 

If you have any specific values for x or want me to perform calculations based on those, please provide more information. Otherwise, I've outlined the general approach.<|im_end|>","He can buy 20 rocks because 100 / 5 = <<100/5=20>>20

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many days Lauren needs to complete the projects, we need to calculate the total number of picture scenes she can produce in one day and then divide the total number of scenes required by this daily production rate.

1. **Calculate daily production:**
   - Large-sized picture scenes: 5 per day
   - Medium-sized picture scenes: 6 per day
   - Small-sized picture scenes: 7 per day

2. **Sum up the total daily production:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 \text{ scenes/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of picture scenes needed:**
   - Total large-sized picture scenes: 45
   - Total medium-sized picture scenes: 36
   - Total small-sized picture scenes: 49

4. **Calculate the total number of picture scenes required:**
   \[
   \text{Total picture scenes} = 45 + 36 + 49 = 130 \text{ scenes}
   \]

5. **Divide the total number of picture scenes by the daily production rate to find the number of days required:**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total picture scenes}}{\text{Daily production}} = \frac{130}{18}
   \]
   
   Simplifying the division:
   \[
   \frac{130}{18} = 7.\overline{22}\ldots
   \]

Since Lauren cannot work for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number because even a partial day would mean she has not completed enough scenes to meet the requirements.

Therefore, it will take her \(8\) days to complete all the picture scenes.

<|im_start|>wait
To find the average speed Sid was traveling, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the average speed for the first trip.
Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time
Average Speed (First Trip) = 110 miles / 2 hours

Calculate:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{110}{2} = 55 \text{ miles per hour} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the average speed for the second trip.
Sid traveled another 140 miles in 3 hours.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time
Average Speed (Second Trip) = 140 miles / 3 hours

Calculate:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{140}{3} \approx 46.67 \text{ miles per hour} \]

### Step 3: Combine both speeds to find the overall average speed.
Since we're asked for the average speed over the entire journey, we use the total distance divided by the total time.

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles
Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Overall Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Overall Average Speed = \(\frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}}\)

Calculate:
\[ \text{Overall Average Speed} = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both lottery tickets will be winners.

1. **Determine the probabilities for each ticket:**
   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% (or 0.2) chance of winning.
   - The second lottery ticket has three times the likelihood of the first one, so it has \(3 \times 0.2 = 0.6\) or 60% (or 0.6) chance of winning.

2. **Calculate the combined probability of both tickets being winners:**
   Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we can multiply their individual probabilities together to find the overall probability that both tickets are winners.

\[
\text{Probability both tickets are winners} = (\text{probability first ticket wins}) \times (\text{probability second ticket wins})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
= 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12
\]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**

To express the result as a percentage, we multiply by 100%.

\[
0.12 \times 100\% = 12\%
\]

Therefore, the probability that both lottery tickets are winners is 12%.<|im_end|>","First triple 20% to find the second ticket's chance of winning: .2 * 3 = <<.2*3=.6>>.6
Then multiply both tickets' chances of winning to find the probability they both win, and multiply that by 100 to convert it to a percentage: .6 * .2 * 100% = 12%

                    Carlos, Jim and , Carrey were at . the beach , playing ! and they ; decided to ; gather some seashells.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Carlos, Jim, and Carrey were at the beach.
   - They played together.
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim's collection was 5 more than Carlos' collection.
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - They gathered all their seashells and divided them equally among themselves.

2. **Define variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
   Let \( J = 27 \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected (given).
   Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

3. **Set up equations based on the given conditions:**
   - From ""Jim collected 27 seashells"", we have \( J = 27 \).
   - From ""Jim's collection was 5 more than Carlos' collection"", we have \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]
   - From ""Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey"", we have \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected:**
   - The total number of seashells collected is \( J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \).

5. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three people:**
   - Each person gets an equal share of \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) seashells.

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells

In total, they collected 27+22+11 = <<27+22+11=60>>60 seashells
They divided them into three equal group, getting 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 each

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the amount he consumes on weekdays and on weekends separately, then sum these amounts.

1. Calculate the number of carrots eaten during weekdays:
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - Mason eats 4 carrots per day.
   - Total carrots on weekdays = \(5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day}\).

2. Calculate the number of carrots eaten during weekends:
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Mason eats 5 carrots per day.
   - Total carrots on weekends = \(2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day}\).

3. Sum the total number of carrots for weekdays and weekends:

\[
\text{Total carrots} = (\text{Weekday carrots}) + (\text{Weekend carrots})
\]

Let's perform the calculations:

- Weekday carrots: 
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

- Weekend carrots:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, add both totals together:

\[
\text{Total carrots} = 20 + 10 = 30

To determine how long the entire cassette is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the length of the first song**: 
   - The first song is given as 5 minutes.

2. **Determine the length of the second song**:
   - The second song is described as being 60% longer than the first song.
   - To find 60% of the first song's duration (5 minutes):
     \[
     5 \times 0.6 = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this value to the original duration of the first song:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total duration of the cassette**:
   - Sum the durations of both songs:
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Verify if the information about the two songs' lengths aligns correctly**:
   - We have one song at 5 minutes and another at 8 minutes. This suggests that the description might be incorrect or misleading, but for our calculations, we proceed with the provided data.

Therefore, the total time for the cassette is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of one mobile device:**
   - The initial purchase price of one mobile device is $20.

2. **Determine the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - According to the problem, Linus sells the mobile device at twice its original price.
   - Selling price = 2 × Original Price = 2 × $20 = $40.

3. **Calculate the total cost for two devices on Monday:**
   - Cost per device = $20.
   - Number of devices = 2.
   - Total cost for Monday's purchases = 2 × $20 = $40.

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling two devices on Monday:**
   - Selling price per device = $40.
   - Number of devices sold = 2.
   - Total revenue from Monday sales = 2 × $40 = $80.

5. **Calculate the profit from selling two devices on Monday:**
   - Profit = Revenue - Cost = $80 - $40 = $40.

6. **Calculate the total cost for four devices on Tuesday:**
   - Cost per device = $20.
   - Number of devices = 4.
   - Total cost for Tuesday's purchases = 4 × $20 = $80.

7. **Calculate the total revenue from selling four devices on Tuesday:**

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many more bottles of carrots juices Hortex would need to produce to meet the daily energy demands of 2300 people, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, to cover the entire daily energy demand of one person, you need \( \frac{1}{20} \) bottles per person.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is \( 2300 \times \frac{1}{20} = 115 \) bottles.

2. **Determine how many additional bottles are needed:**
   - Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the total needed:
     \[
     115 \text{ (bottles needed)} - 4200 \text{ (current production)} = -4085 \text{ (additional bottles needed)}
     \]
   - Since the result is negative, this indicates that Hortex already exceeds the requirement by producing too many bottles. It actually has 2985 fewer bottles than necessary (i.e., 4200 - 115).

Therefore, Hortex does not need to produce any more bottles; in fact, they currently exceed the requirements by 2985 bottles. The final answer is:

\boxed{-2985}<|im_end|>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of babies dressed in each color.

- Total octuplets = 8 (identical)
  
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)

- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

### Step 2: Calculate how many of these babies have bows.

- All babies who are blue wear bows.
  - Number of blue babies = 2

- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple babies wear bows.
  - Number of purple babies = 6
  - Number of purple babies who wear bows = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

### Step 3: Sum up the total number of babies who wear bows.

- Total babies with bows = Babies who wear bows (blue) + Purple babies who wear bows
  - Total babies with bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4

### Step 4: Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

- Probability that a baby wearing a bow is purple = 
\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple babies with bows}}{\text{Total babies with bows}} \]

- Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{Purple | Bow}) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total area of unused land.
Abraham has 80 square meters of unused land.

### Step 2: Calculate how much land Abraham sold in the first transaction.
He sold half of his land for $50.
- Half of 80 square meters = 40 square meters.
- Selling 40 square meters for $50 implies that $50 covers 40 square meters.
  
### Step 3: Calculate the price per square meter from the first sale.
Price per square meter = Total amount received / Area sold
= $50 / 40 sqm = $1.25 per square meter

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of land sold in the second transaction.
After the first sale, Abraham had 40 square meters left. He sold one quarter (1/4) of what was left.
- One quarter of 40 square meters = 10 square meters.
- The price he gets for these 10 square meters is $30.

### Step 5: Calculate the price per square meter from the second sale.
Using the same logic as above, we can determine the price per square meter from the second sale.
- Price per square meter = Total amount received / Area sold
= $30 / 10 sqm = $3 per square meter

### Step 6: Calculate the total earnings from the third sale.
For the remaining land, he sells it at $3 per square meter.
- Remaining land = 40 - 10 = 30 square meters.
- Earnings from remaining land = 30 sqm * $3/sqm = $90.

### Step 7: Sum up all earnings.
Total earnings = First sale + Second sale + Third sale
= $50 + $30 + $90 = $170.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn a total of **$170** after selling all his unused land.<|im_end|>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Geb's age is represented as \( G \).
   - Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.
   - Haley's age is 26 years.

2. **Translate the relationship between Geb's age and Haley's age into an equation:**
   Let \( H \) represent Haley's age, which is given as 26 years.
   
   According to the problem, Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. We can write this as:
   \[
   G = \frac{H}{2} - 10
   \]

3. **Substitute Haley's age into the equation:**
   Since \( H = 26 \), substitute it into the equation:
   \[
   G = \frac{26}{2} - 10
   \]
   
4. **Simplify the expression:**
   Calculate the division first:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
   Then subtract 10 from 13:
   \[
   G = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The final answer is that Geb is 3 years old.

\[
\boxed{\text{Geb is 3 years old}}

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of times Tyrion changes his face in one day.
Tyrion changes his face twice for each outing. He goes out three times a day.

\[
\text{Total face changes per day} = \text{Number of outings per day} \times \text{Face changes per outing}
\]
\[
= 3 \times 2
\]
\[
= 6
\]

So, Tyrion changes his face 6 times per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of face masks used over 2 days.
If Tyrion changes his face 6 times per day, we need to find out how many times he will change his face in 2 days.

\[
\text{Total face changes in 2 days} = \text{Face changes per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
= 6 \times 2

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of eggs initially hidden:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, 3 dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.

2. **Calculate how many eggs each person found:**
   - **Lamar:** Found 5 eggs.
   - **Stacy:** Found twice as many as Lamar.
     So, \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.
   - **Charlie:** Found 2 fewer than Stacy.
     So, \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
   - **Mei:** Found half as many as Charlie.
     So, \(8 / 2 = 4\) eggs.

3. **Sum up all the eggs found:**
   - Total eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
     \(5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\)

4. **Subtract the found eggs from the initial amount to find out how many are still hidden:**
   - Initial number of eggs (36) minus the number found (\(27\)):
     \(36 - 27 = 9\)

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is \(\boxed{9}\).<|im_end|>","Cole hides 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.

Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.
The children find a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.
The total number of hidden eggs still in the yard is 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - The first complex has 200 apartments.
   - The second complex also has 200 apartments.
   - The third complex (which is larger) is 60% bigger than the second complex.

   Let's calculate how many more apartments the third complex has compared to the second:
   \[
   200 + 0.6 \times 200 = 200 + 120 = 320
   \]

   So, the third complex has 320 apartments.

2. **Sum up all apartments:**
   \[
   200 + 200 + 320 = 720

3. **Calculate the total number of collections per week:**
   Since John collects garbage 3 times a week, we multiply the total number of apartments by 3:
   \[
   720 \times 3 = 2160
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount earned per collection:**
   John earns $0.40 per collection. Therefore, his earnings per collection can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   2160 \times 0.40 = 864
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount earned per week:**
   To find out how much money John makes in a week, we multiply the total amount earned per collection by the number of collections per week:
   \[
   864 \times 3 = 2592

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by different age trees over their respective lifetimes.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define the Initial Number of Fruits:**
   Let's denote the initial number of fruits as \( F \).

2. **Calculate Fruits Produced by Each Age Tree:**

   - **5-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree produces 50 fruits.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 50F
     \]

   - **6-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree produces three times the initial amount of fruits.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 3 \times 50F = 150F
     \]

   - **7-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree produces seven times the initial amount of fruits.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 7 \times 50F = 350F
     \]

   - **8-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree produces 200 fewer fruits than the initial amount.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = (50F - 200)
     \]
     
     Simplifying further,
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 50F - 200
     \]

   - **9-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree does not produce any fruits.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 0
     \]

   - **10-Year-Old Tree:**
     The tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.
     
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 20 \times 50F = 1000F
     \]

3. **Sum Up All the Total Fruits Produced Over 10 Years:**

   Now, let’s sum up all the total fruits from each tree over the given period.

   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 50F + 150F + 350F + (50F - 200) + 0 + 1000F
   \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**

   Combine like terms:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = (50F + 150F + 350F + 50F - 200 + 1000F) 
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = 1650F
   \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits that an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is:

\[
\boxed{1650F}
\]<|im_end|>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits
At 6 years it produces 50 * 3 = <<50*3=150>>150 fruits.

At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount**: Jack initially has $100.

2. **Determine how much money Sophia gives to Jack**: Sophia gives Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100.

3. **Calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $100**:
   - First, convert $100 into cents for easier calculation: 
     \[
     \$100 = 100 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 10000 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Then, find \( \frac{1}{5} \) of 10000 cents:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Convert back to dollars**: Since there are 100 cents in a dollar,
   \[
   2000 \text{ cents} = \frac{2000}{100} = \$20
   \]

5. **Add the given money to Jack's original amount**: 
   \[
   \$100 + \$20 = \$120
   \]

Therefore, after receiving $20 from Sophia, Jack now has $\boxed{120}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Sophia gave 100 * 1/5 =<<100*1/5=20>>20 $ to Jack.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( R \) represent the length of the red rope.
   - Let \( B \) represent the length of the blue rope.
   - Let \( Y \) represent the length of the yellow rope.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - According to the first piece of information, ""The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope,"" we can write this as:
     \[
     R = 4B
     \]

   - According to the second piece of information, ""The blue rope was seven centimeters shorter than the yellow rope,"" we can write this as:
     \[
     B = Y - 7
     \]

   - The third piece of information states that ""the three ropes had a combined length of thirty-seven centimeters,"" which gives us:
     \[
     R + B + Y = 37
     \]

3. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - Substitute \( R = 4B \) into the equation \( R + B + Y = 37 \):
     \[
     4B + B + Y = 37
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     5B + Y = 37
     \]

   - Now substitute \( Y = B + 7 \) from the second equation \( B = Y - 7 \):
     \[
     Y = (B + 7)
     \]
     So,
     \[
     5B + (B + 7) = 37
     \]
     Simplifying further:
     \[
     6B + 7 = 37
     \]
     Subtract 7 from both sides:
     \[
     6B = 30
     \]
     Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     B = 5
     \]

4. **Find Lengths of Each Rope:**
   - Using \( B = 5 \), find \( R \):
     \[
     R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20
     \]
   - Find \( Y \):
     \[
     Y = B + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the red rope is \( R = 20 \) centimeters.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Distribution:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial amount of money that Rissa received.
   - Since Ronnie received $5, we can express the total initial distribution as:
     \[
     \text{Total Initial Money} = x + 3x + 5 = 4x + 5
     \]

2. **Equal Amount Given Later:**
   - They then equally distribute all their money among themselves.
   - The total money after redistribution is:
     \[
     \frac{4x + 5}{2}
     \]
   - Each person receives an equal share of this money.

3. **Money Left for Each Person:**
   - After receiving the equal share, Rissa has:
     \[
     \left(\frac{4x + 5}{2}\right) - x = \frac{x + 5}{2}
     \]
   - Similarly, Ronnie also has:
     \[
     \left(\frac{4x + 5}{2}\right) - 5 = \frac{4x + 5 - 10}{2} = \frac{4x - 5}{2}
     \]

4. **Rissa's Final Condition:**
   - According to the problem, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her original amount:
     \[
     \frac{x + 5}{2} = \frac{4(x + 5)}{10} = \frac{2(x + 5)}{5}
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     x + 5 = \frac{2(x + 5)}{5}
     \]
     \[
     5(x + 5) = 2(x + 5)
     \]
     \[
     5x + 25 = 2x + 10
     \]
     \[
     3x = -15
     \]
     \[
     x = -5
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Substituting \( x = -5 \) back into the expression for Ronnie’s money:
     \[
     \frac{4(-5) - 5}{2} = \frac{-20 - 5}{2} = \frac{-25}{2} = -\frac{25}{2} = -12.5

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    , A wall mural has four different colors ! of paint in it: red, white, purple, and . yellow.  There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural. Half the mural is ! yellow. If the mural used 12 pints of paint in all, how many pints ; of red paint was used?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the amount of paint (in pints) for each color.

- Red = \( x \)
- White = \( x \)
- Purple = \( x \)
- Yellow = \( x \)

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know that half of the mural is yellow. Since there are four colors, we can calculate the total percentage of yellow paint as follows:

\[ \text{Total} = \frac{x}{4} \]

Given that half the mural is yellow:

\[ \frac{x}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total} \]

Since the total amount of paint is 12 pints, the total can be represented as:

\[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} = 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 4x = 12 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ x = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, each color (red, white, purple, and yellow) uses 3 pints of paint.

### Step 4: Determine the Amount of Red Paint Used
Since the red paint represents one of the four colors and each color uses 3 pints, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \text{Red paint} = 3 \text{ pints} \]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 3 \text{ pints}}
\]<|im_end|>","Half the mural is yellow, so the other half took 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pints of paint.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the total area of Tom's house, let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of Bedrooms**: 4 bedrooms.
2. **Bedroom Dimensions**: Each bedroom measures 20 ft x 12 ft = 240 sq ft (since area = length × width).
3. **Living Room Size**: The living room is 5 times larger than one bedroom.

First, calculate the size of one bedroom:
- Area of one bedroom = 240 sq ft.

Next, determine the size of the living room:
- Living room size = 5 × 240 sq ft = 1200 sq ft.

Now, we know that the living room alone takes up 1200 sq ft. Since the rest of the house is 1000 sq ft, this means the remaining space consists of all other rooms except for the living room.

Let's denote the total area of the house as \( A \). We can express the total area as follows:
\[ A = \text{Area of one bedroom} + \text{Area of living room} + \text{Remaining area}\]

We already have:
- Area of one bedroom = 240 sq ft.
- Area of living room = 1200 sq ft.

Therefore, the remaining area is:
\[ A - 240 \text{ sq ft} - 1200 \text{ sq ft} = 1000 \text{ sq ft}\]

Since the remaining area equals 1000 sq ft, it confirms our calculation:
\[ A = 240 \text{ sq ft} + 1200 \text{ sq ft} + 1000 \text{ sq ft}\]
\[ A = 240 \text{ sq ft} + 1200 \text{ sq ft} + 1000 \text{ sq ft} = 1940 \text{ sq ft}\]

So, the total area of the house is:
\[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count on Monday:**
   - On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

2. **Counting Puffs per Day After Monday:**
   - Each subsequent day (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) Alice counts twice the number of clouds from the previous day.
   
   Let's calculate these counts:
   - Tuesday: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs
   - Wednesday: \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs
   - Thursday: \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs
   - Friday: \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs
   
3. **Summing Up Counts for All Days:**
   - We need to add up the total number of clouds counted over the five days.
   
   Calculating the total:
   - Total = \(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\)
   
   Adding these together:
   \[
   3 + 6 = 9 \\
   9 + 12 = 15 \\
   15 + 24 = 39 \\
   39 + 48 = 87
   \]
   
Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice has counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is 87.<|im_end|>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.

On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many dishwashing cycles you can perform with the special box at $1, given that you use one pod per cycle, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the regular box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods.

2. **Determine the number of pods in the special box:**
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods:
     \[
     0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods}
     \]
   - Add this to the original number of pods:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - Since both boxes cost the same amount ($1), the cost per pod remains constant at $1.

4. **Determine the total cost for one cycle using one pod per cycle:**
   - Cost per pod is $1, so the cost for one cycle (using one pod) is $1.

5. **Calculate the number of cycles possible with $1:**
   - Divide the total amount of money ($1) by the cost per cycle ($1):
     \[
     \frac{1}{1} = 1 \text{ cycle}
     \]

Therefore, with the special box containing 120 pods, you can run **one dishwashing cycle** for $1 using one pod per cycle.<|im_end|>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of bills initially withdrawn.
Thomas withdraws $1000 using $20 bills.

- Number of bills = Total amount / Bill value
\[ \text{Number of bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many bills Thomas has after losing some.
Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home.

- Remaining bills = Initial bills - Lost bills
\[ \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much money Thomas spends.
He uses half of his remaining bills to buy a bill.

- Amount spent (half of remaining) = Half of remaining bills
\[ \text{Amount spent} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Thomas has left after buying the bill.
- Money left after buying the bill = Original amount - Amount spent
\[ \text{Money left} = 1000 - 20 = 980 \]

### Step 5: Triple the remaining money.
- Tripling the money = Money * 3
\[ \text{Tripled money} = 980 \times 3 = 2940 \]

### Step 6: Convert all remaining money to $5 bills.
- Number of $5 bills = Tripled money / Value of one bill
\[ \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{2940}{20} = 147 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of goals scored in the entire match. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the score for Team B in the First Half
- Team A scores 4 goals.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A.

\[
\text{Goals Scored by Team B} = \text{Goals Scored by Team A} - 2
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Goals Scored by Team B} = 4 - 2 = 2
\]

So, Team B scores 2 goals in the first half.

### Step 2: Determine the score for Team A in the Second Half
- The problem states that Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of goals scored by Team B.

Since Team B scored 2 goals:

\[
\text{Goals Scored by Team A} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2
\]

Calculate this:

\[
\text{Goals Scored by Team A} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

So, Team A scores 0.5 goals in the second half.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Goals Scored in the Match
Add up all the goals from both teams:

- Goals scored by Team A (first half): 4
- Goals scored by Team A (second half): 0.5
- Goals scored by Team B (first half): 2

Total number of goals:

\[
\text{Total Goals} = 4 + 0.5 + 2 = 6.5
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of goals scored in the match is **6.5**.<|im_end|>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals

Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the amount of chalk left after each day:**
   - Initially, the teacher starts with 5 inches of chalk.
   - Each day, he uses 20% of the chalk, leaving 80%.

2. **Calculate the remaining chalk after each day:**
   - After Day 1 (Monday): 
     \[
     5 \times 0.8 = 4 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After Day 2 (Tuesday):
     \[
     4 \times 0.8 = 3.2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After Day 3 (Wednesday):
     \[
     3.2 \times 0.8 = 2.56 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - After Day 4 (Thursday):
     \[
     2.56 \times 0.8 = 2.048 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Identify when the chalk reaches or falls below 2 inches:**
   - By Thursday, the chalk is at 2.048 inches.

4. **Since the teacher needs chalk larger than 2 inches to continue writing effectively, we determine the number of days until he must start recycling:**

   - At the end of Wednesday (after 3 days), there are 2.56 inches left.
   - After 4 days, there are 2.048 inches left.

Therefore, the teacher will need to start recycling chalk on the 5th day because he would be unable to write with less than 2 inches of chalk if he continues using 20% daily.

**Final Answer:** The teacher has to recycle this piece of chalk after **5 days**.<|im_end|>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of teeth drilled:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Determine how many teeth the dentist caps:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than what was drilled.
   - Since they drilled 4 teeth, they cap \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

3. **Find the total number of teeth fixed by the dentist:**
   - Add the number of teeth drilled to the number of teeth capped.
   - Total fixed teeth = Drilled teeth + Capped teeth
   - Total fixed teeth = 4 (drilled) + 11 (capped)
   - Total fixed teeth = 15

4. **Calculate the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes:**
   - Use the formula for percentage: \(\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of fixed teeth}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100\% \).
   - Substitute the values into the formula.
   - Percentage = \(\left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100\%\).

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   - Simplify \(\frac{15}{30}\) to \(\frac{1}{2}\).

6. **Convert the simplified fraction to a percentage:**
   - Multiply \(\frac{1}{2}\) by 100.
   - Percentage = \(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100\% = 50\%\).

                    question:
                    A company sold 4000 gallons of milk in jars to Mr. Marcellus' store at the : cost of $3.5 per gallon. However, Mr. Marcellus later realized 2/5 of the amount of milk he ? purchased had passed the expiry date ; and could not be sold. He returned the sour milk to the company . and ordered a refund. Calculate how much he got in refunds.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the milk:**
   - The company sells milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   - They sold 4000 gallons of milk.
   - Total cost = Number of gallons × Price per gallon
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 4000 \times 3.5 = \$14000
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of milk that was returned due to expiration:**
   - Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he bought.
   - Amount of milk returned = (2/5) × Total milk purchased
     \[
     \text{Amount of Milk Returned} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the revenue lost from the expired milk:**
   - Revenue loss = Cost per gallon × Number of gallons returned
     \[
     \text{Revenue Loss} = 3.5 \times 1600 = \$5600
     \]

4. **Subtract the revenue loss from the total sales to find the net profit:**
   - Net profit = Total sales - Revenue loss
     \[
     \text{Net Profit} = 14000 - 5600 = \$8400
     \]

5. **Calculate the refund amount based on the net profit:**
   - The refund is proportional to the net profit.
   - Since the entire sale represented an 84% of the total profit, we can use this ratio to calculate the refund.
   - Let \( R \) be the refund amount.
   - We know that \( R \) should cover the same percentage as the original purchase.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     R = \frac{\text{Original Purchase}}{\text{Net Profit}}
     \]
     \[
     R = \frac{14000}{8400}
     \]
     Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     R = \frac{14000}{8400} = \frac{140}{84} = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age.

2. **Wendy’s Age Relationship:**
   Since Wendy is five times as old as Colin, we can write her age relationship as:
   \[
   W = 5C
   \]
   where \( W \) represents Wendy's current age.

3. **Colin’s Age in 25 Years:**
   In 25 years, Colin's age will be:
   \[
   C + 25
   \]

4. **Wendy’s Age in 25 Years:**
   Using the same variable for Wendy's age, in 25 years she will be:
   \[
   W + 25
   \]

5. **Colin's Age as a Third of Wendy's Age in 25 Years:**
   According to the problem, in 25 years, Colin's age will be one-third of Wendy's age at that time:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (W + 25)
   \]

6. **Substitute Wendy's Age into the Equation:**
   Substitute \( W = 5C \) into the equation:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (5C + 25)
   \]

7. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   3(C + 25) = 5C + 25
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 25
   \]

8. **Isolate the Variable:**
   Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
   \[
   75 = 2C + 25
   \]
   Subtract 25 from both sides:
   \[
   50 = 2C
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   C = 25
   \]

9. **Conclusion:**
   Colin is currently 25 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of books that can be bought with the given amount**

- **Total money available:** $27000
- **Cost per book:** $500

First, calculate how many books Bob can buy with his entire budget:

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per book}} = \frac{27000}{500}
\]

\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
\]

So, Bob can buy a total of 54 books.

**Step 2: Determine how many schools Bob has**

- **Number of schools:** 3

**Step 3: Calculate the number of books that can be bought from each school**

Since Bob has 54 books in total and he wants to distribute them equally among 3 schools:

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of schools}}
\]

\[
\text{Books per school} = \frac{54}{3}

\[
\text{Books per school} = 18

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Slices Needed
First, we need to calculate the total number of slices that all of Kate's friends will consume.

- Each friend eats \(6\) slices.
- There are \(6\) friends.

\[
6 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} = 36 \text{ slices}
\]

So, the total number of slices needed for her friends is **36 slices**.

### Step 2: Determine Number of Slices from Each Pie
Next, we know the sizes of each type of pie:

- Cheese pizza has \(12\) slices.
- Pepperoni pizza has \(8\) slices.

We'll now find out how many full pies are required based on these numbers.

#### Cheese Pizza Calculation:
Since each slice from the cheese pizza corresponds to one slice in total, we can divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per cheese pizza:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per cheese pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
\]

#### Pepperoni Pizza Calculation:
Similarly, for the pepperoni pizza, we divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pepperoni pizza:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pepperoni pizza}} = 4.5 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}
\]

Since you can't have half a pizza pie, round up to ensure there's enough for everyone. So, she would need **5 pepperoni pizzas**.

### Step 3: Total Pies Required
Now, add the number of cheese and pepperoni pies together:

\[
3 \text{ cheese pies} + 5 \text{ pepperoni pies} = 8 \text{ total pies}
\]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy **8 pies** to cover all the slices consumed by her friends.<|im_end|>","Kate’s friends eat 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 cheese pizza slices.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs after starting with 20, let's break this down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the rate at which Jay builds snowballs.
Jay can build 20 snowballs per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of snowballs that melt.
Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many sets of 15 minutes are there in one hour (60 minutes).

- Number of 15-minute intervals in one hour = \( \frac{60}{15} = 4 \) intervals.

Each interval results in 2 melted snowballs, so over one hour, the total number of melted snowballs would be:
\[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ snowballs melted} \]

### Step 3: Determine the net increase in snowballs per hour.
After building 20 snowballs, Jay loses 8 snowballs due to melting. So, the net increase per hour is:
\[ 20 - 8 = 12 \text{ snowballs per hour} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the time required to reach 60 snowballs from 20.
We start with 20 snowballs and aim to end up with 60 snowballs. The net increase needed is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ snowballs} \]

Given that Jay gains 12 snowballs per hour, we calculate the time required as follows:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Number of snowballs needed}}{\text{Net increase per hour}} = \frac{40}{12} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take approximately **3.33 hours** for Jay to collect enough snowballs to have 60.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **3.33 hours**.<|im_end|>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.

It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Digimon has its 20th anniversary.
   - John is twice as old as Jim.

2. **Define variables for their ages:**
   Let \( J \) represent John's current age.
   Let \( I \) represent Jim's current age.

3. **Set up equations based on the relationships provided:**
   According to the problem, John is twice as old as Jim:
   \[
   J = 2I
   \]

4. **Use the information about the Digimon anniversary:**
   The Digimon has its 20th anniversary, which implies that there have been exactly 20 years since the release of Digimon. Since John is currently 28 years old, we can write:
   \[
   J + 20 = 28
   \]

5. **Solve for John's current age (J):**
   Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   J = 28 - 20 = 18
   \]
   So, John is currently 18 years old.

6. **Substitute back to find Jim's age (I):**
   Using the relationship \( J = 2I \), substitute \( J = 18 \):
   \[
   18 = 2I
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   I = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]
   Therefore, Jim is 9 years old.

7. **Verify the solution:**
   Check if John being twice as old as Jim holds true:
   \[
   J = 2 \times I = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]
   This confirms our calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:** Jim is 9 years old.<|im_end|>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of bandages used over three days:**
   - Day 1: Used 38 bandages.
   - Day 2: Used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages (since they used 10 fewer than the previous day).
   - Day 3: Ordered 2 packs, but used only half of one pack.

2. **Calculate the total number of bandages used over the three days:**
   \[

3. **Determine how many bandages were available at the beginning:**
   Let \(x\) be the number of bandages at the beginning. We know that after using them over three days, there are 78 bandages left.
   
4. **Set up an equation to find \(x\):**
   The total number of bandages initially minus the total number used equals the remaining bandages:

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of inches of hair being cut
- Her hair starts at 10 inches.
- She ends up at 8 inches.

Number of inches cut = Starting length - Ending length
= 10 inches - 8 inches
= 2 inches

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the haircut
- The cost per inch of haircut is $30.
- Number of inches cut = 2 inches.

Total cost for the haircut = Cost per inch × Number of inches cut
= $30 × 2 inches
= $60

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the color
- The cost of coloring is $40.

### Step 4: Add the costs together to find the total cost
- Total cost for the haircut = $60
- Total cost for coloring = $40

                    question:
                    Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate , is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. ? Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly , 4 weeks in April, how much will she receive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Jen will receive in April, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Jen's total earnings from her regular work**

Jen works for 7.5 hours per day and earns $1.5 per hour.

First, calculate the daily earnings:
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked} \]
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \$1.5 \times 7.5 \]

Calculate \(1.5 \times 7.5\):
\[ 1.5 \times 7.5 = 11.25 \]

So, Jen earns $11.25 per day.

Next, calculate her weekly earnings (assuming she works every day):
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked} \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$11.25 \times 6 \]

Calculate \(11.25 \times 6\):
\[ 11.25 \times 6 = 68.25 \]

Therefore, Jen earns $68.25 per week.

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we can now calculate her total earnings for the month of April:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \$68.25 \times 4 \]

Calculate \(68.25 \times 4\):
\[ 68.25 \times 4 = 273 \]

**Step 2: Add the bonus for complete attendance**

Jen receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance throughout the month.

Finally, add this bonus to her total monthly earnings:
\[ \text{Final Total} = \text{Total Monthly Earnings} + \text{Bonus} \]
\[ \text{Final Total} = \$273 + \$10 \]

Calculate \(273 + 10\):
\[ 273 + 10 = 283 \]

Therefore, the final amount Jen will receive is:
{The final answer is} **$283**.<|im_end|>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week
So in a month, she works for 45 hours/week x 4 weeks = <<45*4=180>>180 hours.
180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for each task per week

1. **Laundry**:
   - Earnings per week: $3.00
   - Weeks in two weeks: 2
   - Total earnings from laundry: \( 3 \times 2 = \$6.00 \)

2. **Cleaning Room**:
   - Earnings per week: $1.50
   - Weeks in two weeks: 2
   - Total earnings from cleaning room: \( 1.50 \times 2 = \$3.00 \)

3. **Taking Trash to Curb**:
   - Earnings per week: $0.75
   - Weeks in two weeks: 2
   - Total earnings from taking trash to curb: \( 0.75 \times 2 = \$1.50 \)

4. **Emptying Dishwasher**:
   - Earnings per week: $0.50
   - Weeks in two weeks: 2
   - Total earnings from emptying dishwasher: \( 0.50 \times 2 = \$1.00 \)

### Step 2: Sum up all earnings for the two-week period

Now, let's add up the total earnings from each task over the two-week period:

- Laundry earnings: $6.00
- Cleaning room earnings: $3.00
- Taking trash to curb earnings: $1.50
- Emptying dishwasher earnings: $1.00

Total earnings:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of blood in one whale:**
   - According to the information given, each whale has 40 gallons of blood.

2. **Calculate the amount of blood in one shark:**
   - A shark has three times as much blood as a whale.
   - Therefore, the amount of blood in one shark = \(3 \times 40\) gallons.

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

So, each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

3. **Calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks:**
   - We know there are 10 sharks.
   - Each shark has 120 gallons of blood.
   - Therefore, the total amount of blood in ten sharks = \(10 \times 120\) gallons.

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 10 \times 120 = 1200 \]

Thus, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is 1200 gallons.

2. Calculate the total number of red pens.
3. Calculate the total number of black pens.
4. Sum the total number of red and black pens to find out how many pens Alain has.

Step 1: Number of packs of black pens bought
Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens. She also bought twice as much black pens as red pens. So, she bought:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ packs of black pens} \]

Step 2: Total number of red pens
Each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, for 5 packs of red pens, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Step 3: Total number of black pens
Since she bought 10 packs of black pens, the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Step 4: Total number of pens
Now, we sum the total number of red and black pens to find out how many pens Alain has:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much John spends in total on both scotch and cognac.

### Step 1: Determine the price per bottle of scotch
John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total of $600.
\[ \text{Price per bottle of scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10} = \$60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of cognac
John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch.
\[ \text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

### Step 3: Determine the price per bottle of cognac
Cognac costs 50% more than scotch per bottle.
\[ \text{Price per bottle of cognac} = \text{Price per bottle of scotch} + (0.5 \times \text{Price per bottle of scotch}) \]
\[ \text{Price per bottle of cognac} = \$60 + (0.5 \times \$60) \]
\[ \text{Price per bottle of cognac} = \$60 + \$30 \]
\[ \text{Price per bottle of cognac} = \$90 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cognac
John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times \$90 = \$1800 \]

### Step 5: Add up the total cost of both drinks
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of scotch} + \text{Cost of cognac} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$600 + \$1800 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2400 \]

                    question:
                    To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted twenty ! trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak on his first day. ? On the second day, he planted 10 more . White ; Oak trees and 1/4 . more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Calculate the total number of ; trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of White Oak trees planted on the first day.

Mr. Julius planted 20 trees of White Oak.

### Step 2: Determine the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day.

He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak trees.

\[ \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (first day)} = 2 \times \text{White Oak trees} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of White Oak trees planted on the second day.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees.

\[ \text{White Oak trees (second day)} = \text{White Oak trees (first day)} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the second day.

On the second day, he also planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day.

\[ \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (second day)} = \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (first day)} + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (first day)} \right) \]
\[ \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (second day)} = 40 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \right) \]
\[ \text{Lodgepole Pine trees (second day)} = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted over the two days.

Total number of trees = Number of White Oak trees + Number of Lodgepole Pine trees

\[ \text{Total number of trees} = 20 (\text{White Oak}) + 40 (\text{Lodgepole Pine}) + 30 (\text{White Oak}) + 50 (\text{Lodgepole Pine}) \]
\[ \text{Total number of trees} = 20 + 40 + 30 + 50 = 140 \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \boxed{140}.<|im_end|>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.
On the second day, he increased the number of White Oak trees planted to 20 trees + 10 trees = <<20+10=30>>30 trees.
At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees
Mr. Julius planted a total of 50 trees + 30 trees + 40 trees + 20 trees = <<50+30+40+20=140>>140 trees.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - Fred makes 24 gallons of root beer.
   - He puts it in the refrigerator cooler.

2. **Second Day:**
   - Fred has 0 gallons left (since all root beer was taken from the cooler).
   - His wife, Barbie, discovers the root beer and spills 7 gallons.
   - Now, Fred only has 7 gallons left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - Fred doesn't mention anyone visiting or helping himself.
   - We can assume no one else takes any root beer.
   - The total gallons remain at 7 gallons.

4. **Fourth Day:**
   - Three people arrive at the party.
   - These three people share the remaining 7 gallons equally.
   
To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total gallons by the number of people:

\[
\frac{7 \text{ gallons}}{3 \text{ people}} = 2.33 \text{ gallons per person}
\]

So, each person drinks approximately 2.33 gallons during the party.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**The final answer is:** 2.33 gallons per person.<|im_end|>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.
On day two, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 20-7=<<20-7=13>>13 gallons of root beer.
On day three, Ronnie helped himself to 5 gallons, leaving 13-5=<<13-5=8>>8 gallons of root beer for the party.
Three guests joined Fred for the party, resulting in 3+1=<<3+1=4>>4 party goers.
If the 4 party-goers split the root beer equally, each person gets 8/4=<<8/4=2>>2 gallons

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for the unknown quantity.

1. **Define the variable:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   According to the problem statement, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" should equal 40. We can express this as:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   First, isolate the term involving \( x \):
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 40 - 8
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   4x = 32
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{32}{4}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( x = 8 \).

                    question:
                    There are 66 ; fish in the . fish tank. One-third of the , fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of , the remaining : fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have ! red stripes and ? blue stripes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of fish:**
   The total number of fish is given as 66.

2. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   According to the problem, one-third of all the fish have red stripes.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
   \]

   Let's do the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

   So, there are 22 fish with red stripes.

3. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after removing those with red stripes:**
   Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22
   \]

   Simplify it:

   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]

   Therefore, there are 44 fish left after accounting for the ones with red stripes.

4. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   According to the problem, five-tenths (or 5/10) of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{10} \times 44
   \]

   Simplify the fraction:

   \[
   \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Now multiply:

   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 44 = 22
   \]

   So, there are 22 fish with blue stripes.

5. **Verify the calculation:**
   Add up the fish with red stripes and the fish with blue stripes to ensure they equal the remaining fish:

   \[
   22 (\text{red}) + 22 (\text{blue}) = 44
   \]

   This confirms our calculations are correct.

### Conclusion:
Altogether, there are \(22\) fish that have red stripes and \(22\) fish that have blue stripes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate total number of eyeshadow colors initially:**
   - Amy has 2 eyeshadow palettes.
     Each palette contains 4 colors.
     Total colors in both palettes = \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

   - Amy also has 3 makeup sets containing eyeshadow colors.
     Each set contains 6 colors.
     Total colors in all makeup sets combined = \(3 \times 6 = 18\).

2. **Determine how many colors are stolen by her sister:**
   - The sister steals one palette (which contains 4 colors).

3. **Calculate remaining eyeshadow colors after theft:**
   - After stealing one palette, the remaining eyeshadow palettes contain \(7\) colors each (since there were originally \(2\) palettes).
     Therefore, the remaining colors from the palettes = \(7 + 7 = 14\).

4. **Subtract the colors used from one makeup set:**
   - Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set.
     Since each makeup set contains \(6\) colors, using up half means she uses \(3\) colors.

5. **Calculate the final number of eyeshadow colors left:**
   - Initially, there were \(18\) colors from makeup sets.
   - She uses \(3\) colors from one set.
   - Subtracting these colors leaves her with \(18 - 3 = 15\) colors.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 15 eyeshadow colors.<|im_end|>","Amy had 2 * 4 + 3 * 6 = 8 + 18 = <<2*4+3*6=26>>26 eyeshadow colors to start.

Half the colors from one makeup set are 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 colors.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the roof from the second floor. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the height of Mattison’s house:**
   - Mattison's height = 60 inches.
   - His house is 7 times as high as him.
   \[
   \text{Height of his house} = 60 \times 7 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Determine the height of the first floor:**
   - The first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison's height.
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Find the distance between the first floor and the roof:**
   - Since the house is 420 inches tall and the first floor is 180 inches above ground level (assuming the ground is at zero height), the distance from the first floor to the roof is:
   \[
   \text{Distance from first floor to roof} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}

   - Percentage found by Alphas = 40%.

\[
\text{Shells found by Alphas} = \frac{40}{100} \times 700 = 280

2. **Calculate the remaining shells after Alphas have been accounted for:**
   - Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas.

\[

   - Third dog: walks 3 miles per day (as we're trying to find this out).
   - Fourth dog: walks 3 miles per day.

2. **Sum up the total daily exercise for all four dogs**:

     \]

4. **Find out how much exercise the fourth dog needs**:
   - We already know that the third dog needs 3 miles per day.
   - Therefore, the fourth dog must also need 3 miles per day because the average is 2.75 miles per dog, and if one dog doesn't meet the requirement, it would skew the average higher or lower.

If ! a . kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after : selling all the tunas to the : market?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much Deandre will earn from selling all the tunas, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the tunas:**
   - The weights of the tunas are given as follows:
     - First tuna: 56 kg
     - Second tuna: 46 kg
     - Third tuna: 26 kg
   - Add these weights together to find the total weight.
   
\[
\text{Total weight} = 56 \text{ kg} + 46 \text{ kg} + 26 \text{ kg}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 128 \text{ kg}
\]

2. **Determine the cost per kilogram of tuna:**
   - We know that one kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Multiply the total weight of the tunas by the cost per kilogram.
   
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 128 \text{ kg} \times \$0.50/\text{kg}
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 74 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, after selling all the tunas to the market, Deandre will earn:

\[
\boxed{74 \text{ dollars}}
\]<|im_end|>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.
He will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.
And he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Trinity's profit from selling the magazines, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   - Trinity buys the magazines for $72.
   - She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them.

   First, calculate \( \frac{11}{8} \) of $72:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \div 8 \times 11
   \]
   \[
   72 \div 8 = 9
   \]
   So,
   \[
   9 \times 11 = 99
   \]

3. **Determine the profit:**
   - Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72
   \]
   \[
   99 - 72 = 27

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much water the dehumidifier removes over a series of different settings for 3 days at low speed, 3 more days at medium speed, and 5 more days at high speed.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the daily water removal rates
- **Low Speed**: Removes 1 liter per day.
  
- **Medium Speed**: Removes twice as much as the low speed.
  \[
  2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ liters/day}
  \]

- **High Speed**: Removes twice as much as the medium speed.
  \[
  2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ liters/day}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total water removed using each setting
- **Low Speed (3 days)**:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}
  \]

- **Medium Speed (3 days)**:
  \[
  3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}
  \]

- **High Speed (5 days)**:
  \[
  5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}
  \]

### Step 3: Sum up all the amounts to find the total water removed
\[
3 + 6 + 20 = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total amount of water removed from the air in his basement after running the dehumidifier for the specified periods is \boxed{29 \text{ liters}}.<|im_end|>","The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, for a total of 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day.

- Jolene has 10 packs.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons/pack} = 300 \text{ balloons}
\]

So, there were initially 300 balloons in total.

**Step 2: Determine how many balloons were thrown away**

- At the end of the day, 12 balloons remain.

\[
\text{Total balloons - Balloons remaining} = \text{Balloons thrown}
\]

\[
300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total volume of the second medicine:**
   - Saanvi used 14 mL of the first medicine.
   - The second medicine was used three times as much as the first medicine.
   - Therefore, the volume of the second medicine = 3 × 14 mL.

2. **Calculate the total volume for one dose:**
   - One dose consists of both medicines combined.
   - So, the total volume for one dose = Volume of first medicine + Volume of second medicine.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Volume of the second medicine:
   \[
   3 \times 14 \text{ mL} = 42 \text{ mL}
   \]

2. Total volume for one dose:
   \[
   14 \text{ mL (first medicine)} + 42 \text{ mL (second medicine)} = 56 \text{ mL per dose}
   \]

Now we have determined the total volume required for one dose. To find out how many mL of medicine there will be in 8 doses, we multiply the total volume per dose by 8.

Therefore, the total volume of medicine needed for 8 doses:
\[
56 \text{ mL/dose} \times 8 \text{ doses} = 448 \text{ mL}

                    question:
                    ? Ali is a dean of a : private school : where he , teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. ? John has two , classes in his school.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the capacities of both Ali's and John's schools.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Ali's School Capacity:**
   - Ali teaches one class at his private school.
   - The number of students per class at Ali's school is given as \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the total capacity.
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of Ali's school can be calculated using the relationship between the number of students per class and the total capacity.

\[
\text{Total Capacity of Ali's School} = \frac{\text{Number of Students}}{\text{Students Per Class}} \times \text{Capacity of One Class}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total Capacity of Ali's School} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} \times 120 = 120 \times 8 = 960 \text{ students}
\]

2. **Calculate John's School Capacity:**
   - John teaches two classes at his public school.
   - Each class has a capacity of \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the total capacity.
   - Let \( C_j \) represent the total capacity of John's school.
   - Given that each class has 1/8 of the total capacity, it implies that the total capacity must be such that each class represents \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the total capacity.

Since John has two classes and each class has \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the total capacity:

\[
C_j = 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} \times \text{Total Capacity of John's School} \right)
\]

We know from Ali's school calculation that the total capacity of Ali's school is 960 students. This means that for each of John's classes (which are half of the total capacity):

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total Capacity of John's School} = \frac{1}{8} \times \text{Total Capacity of John's School}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times C_j = \frac{1}{8} \times C_j
\]

Thus,

\[
C_j = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} \times \text{Total Capacity of John's School} \right)
\]

Given that the total capacity of Ali's school is 960 students, we substitute back into the equation:

\[
C_j = 4 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} \times 960 \right) = 4 \times 120 = 480 \text{ students}
\]

3. **Combine the Capacities:**

Now, we add the capacities of both schools together:

\[
\text{Combined Capacity} = \text{Ali's School Capacity} + \text{John's School Capacity}
\]

Substitute the calculated values:

\[
\text{Combined Capacity} = 960 + 480 = 1440 \text{ students}
\]

To solve this problem, we need to break down the situation into steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Stephen owes after the increase:**
   - The initial amount borrowed is $300.
   - He agrees to add an additional 2% of what he already owes.
   - The interest added = $300 * 2% = $6.

   Therefore, the new total amount he owes is:
   \[
   \text{New Total} = \$300 + \$6 = \$306
   \]

2. **Determine how long Stephen has been borrowing money:**
   - The problem states that Stephen gives his sister $25 per month for 11 months.

   So, the total amount given over these 11 months is:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Given} = 11 \times \$25 = \$275
   \]

3. **Subtract the total amount given from the new total amount owed:**
   - After giving her $275, the remaining amount Stephen still owes is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \$306 - \$275 = \$31
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month:**
   - Since the problem mentions that the remaining amount will be paid on the twelfth month, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
   \[
   \text{Amount Paid in Twelfth Month} = \$31
   \]

### Conclusion:
Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

1. **Determine the total number of diapers used per child:**
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of diapers for both children:**
   - There are 2 children.
   - Each child uses 5 diapers per day.
   
   \[
   \text{Total diapers per child} = 5 \text{ diapers/child/day}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total diapers for both children} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ diapers/day}
   \]

3. **Identify how much Jordan’s wife changes in relation to his daily needs:**
   - Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers he uses.

4. **Calculate the number of diapers Jordan changes:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the total number of diapers Jordan changes per day.
   
   According to the problem, Jordan's wife changes half of these diapers.

   Therefore, we can write:

   \[
   \frac{x}{2} \approx x \rightarrow \text{Jordan's wife changes } \frac{x}{2} \text{ diapers}
   \]

5. **Set up an equation based on the information given about the total number of diapers changed:**
   - The total number of diapers changed by Jordan and his wife should equal the total number of diapers needed by both children.

   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 10 \text{ diapers/day}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar
First, we need to find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar.

- **Base Area**: The base area of the jar is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square inches.
- **Height**: The height of the jar is 15 inches.
  
Therefore, the total volume of the jar is:
\[ V_{\text{jar}} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of jelly beans needed for 1 cubic inch
Given that one jelly bean occupies approximately 0.15 cubic inches, we can calculate the number of jelly beans per cubic inch as follows:
\[ \text{Number of Jelly Beans Per Cubic Inch} = \frac{1}{0.15} \approx 6.67 \]

### Step 3: Estimate the number of jelly beans in the jar based on 80% efficiency
Since the packing efficiency is around 80%, we can estimate the total number of jelly beans:
\[ \text{Estimated Number of Jelly Beans} = \frac{\text{Volume of Jar}}{\text{Number of Jelly Beans Per Cubic Inch}} \times 0.8 \]
\[ \text{Estimated Number of Jelly Beans} = \frac{540}{6.67} \times 0.8 \approx 648 \]

### Step 4: Adjust for the fact that only 30% of the jelly beans are red
Given that only 30% of the jelly beans are red, we adjust our estimation to account for this:
\[ \text{True Number of Red Jelly Beans} = \text{Estimated Number of Jelly Beans} \times 0.3 \]
\[ \text{True Number of Red Jelly Beans} = 648 \times 0.3 \approx 194.4 \]

### Step 5: Compare his guess to the actual number of red jelly beans
Tim's initial guess was that there were 900 red jelly beans. We compare this to the actual number he estimated:
\[ \text{Difference} = | \text{Actual Number of Red Jelly Beans} - \text{Initial Guess} | \]
\[ \text{Difference} = | 194.4 - 900 | = 705.6 \]

So, his guess was 705.6 units away from the actual number of red jelly beans.

                    question:
                    A bus has a capacity of 200 people. When it departed Chengli city, it had 20 people. On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus. On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. If the number of passengers on the bus ! doubled at the third station, calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Bus capacity = 200 people
   - Departed from Chengli City with 20 people.

2. **First Station:**
   - Number of people who entered at the first stop = 40
   - Total number of people after the first stop = 20 (initial) + 40 (entered) = 60 people

3. **Second Stop:**
   - The second station saw \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total number of people entering at the first stop.
   - People entering at the second stop = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40\) = 30 people
   - Total number of people after the second stop = 60 (after first stop) + 30 (entered at second stop) = 90 people

4. **Third Stop:**
   - At the third stop, the number of passengers doubles compared to what they were before the third stop.
   - Let \(P_3\) be the number of people in the third stop.
   - According to the problem, the number of passengers doubles to fill the remaining space.
     - After the third stop, the number of people should be equal to the bus's capacity minus the initial number of passengers.
     - Since the bus can only hold up to 200 people, if we denote the remaining space as \(R\), then \(R < 200\).

5. **Determine Remaining Spaces Required:**
   - We know that the number of passengers after the second stop was 90.
   - To find out how many more people are needed to reach the bus's capacity, subtract the current number of passengers from the bus’s capacity:
     \[
     R = 200 - 90 = 110 \text{ seats}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is **110**.<|im_end|>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.

The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

                <|im_end|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of visits Pauline made over 8 years.
2. Determine how much she spent per visit after the increase in cost.
3. Calculate the total amount spent.

**Step 1: Total Number of Visits**

Pauline visits the museum three times a year. Over 5 years, she would have visited:

\[ \text{Total visits} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

For the next 3 years, she continued visiting:

\[ \text{Total visits} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

So, the total number of visits over 8 years is:

\[ \text{Total visits} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

**Step 2: Cost per Visit Before Increase**

Initially, the cost of one visit was $2.

**Step 3: Cost per Visit After Increase**

After 5 years, the cost increased by 150%. This means the new cost is:

\[ \text{New cost} = \$2 \times (1 + 1.5) = \$2 \times 2.5 = \$5 \]

Since Pauline continues to visit the museum for another 3 years at this increased cost, the total amount spent can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \times \$5 = \$120 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

\[
\boxed{\$120}
\]<|im_end|>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.

After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how long it will take for all 10 students to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of groups needed:**
   - There are 10 students.
   - Each group consists of 8 students.
   - We need to find out how many groups of 8 students are required to accommodate all 10 students.

2. **Calculate the number of groups:**
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Students per group}} = \frac{10}{8}
   \]
   Since you can't have a fraction of a group, you'll need to round up to the nearest whole number because even if one student doesn't fit into the last group, they still need to be counted.

3. **Check if rounding up is necessary:**
   \[
   \text{Rounded up value} = \lceil \frac{10}{8} \rceil = \lceil 1.25 \rceil = 2
   \]

So, 2 groups of 8 students are needed to cover all 10 students.

4. **Calculate the total time available:**
   - Each group has 45 minutes.
   - There are 2 groups.
   \[
   \text{Total time available} = \text{Time per group} \times \text{Number of groups} = 45 \times 2 = 90 \text{ minutes}

To determine how much Ali should pay John, we need to calculate the total cost for both the wooden tables and the roof frames. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total cost for the wooden tables:**
   - Each table costs $20.
   - John made 4 wooden tables.

\[
\text{Total cost for tables} = \text{Number of tables} \times \text{Cost per table}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for tables} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the roof frames:**
   - Each roof frame costs $10.
   - John made 2 roof frames.

\[
\text{Total cost for roof frames} = \text{Number of roof frames} \times \text{Cost per roof frame}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for roof frames} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. **Add the costs together to find the total amount Ali has to pay John:**

\[
\text{Total payment} = \text{Total cost for tables} + \text{Total cost for roof frames}
\]

\[
\text{Total payment} = 80 + 20 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Ali should pay John a total of \(100\) dollars.<|im_end|>","For the wooden table, Ali should pay: $20 * 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80

To determine the length of the longer piece after Ian makes the cut, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece.
   
2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \).

3. **Express Total Length:**
   The total length of the board is given as 40 feet. So, the sum of the lengths of both pieces must equal this total length.
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]
   So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet.

5. **Calculate the Longer Piece's Length:**
   Since the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:
   \[
   4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Let x be the length of the shorter piece.

To determine how much of the secret seasoning Aiden needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of meatballs needed:**
   - Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.

2. **Calculate the amount of ground beef required to get 80 meatballs:**
   - Each pound of ground beef yields 16 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the number of pounds of ground beef needed = \( \frac{80}{16} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of ground beef needed in terms of weight:**
   - The calculation gives us 5 pounds of ground beef (since \( \frac{80}{16} = 5 \) pounds).

4. **Determine the amount of seasoning needed per pound of ground beef:**
   - Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.

5. **Calculate the total amount of seasoning needed:**
   - Since he uses 2 tablespoons per pound and he's using 5 pounds of ground beef,
     - Total seasoning needed = \( 2 \times 5 \).

Let's perform the calculations:

- Ground beef: \( 5 \) pounds.
- Seasoning per pound: \( 2 \) tablespoons.
- Total seasoning needed: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) tablespoons.

To determine the total cost of a 36-minute call at two different rates, we need to break down the problem into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 16 minutes.**

- The rate for the first 16 minutes is $0.25 per minute.
- Cost for the first 16 minutes = \( 16 \times 0.25 \).

Let's perform this calculation:

\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \]

So, the cost for the first 16 minutes is **$4.00**.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for the remaining time (after 16 minutes).**

- The rate after 16 minutes is $0.2 per minute.
- Time left after 16 minutes = \( 36 - 16 = 20 \) minutes.
- Cost for the remaining 20 minutes = \( 20 \times 0.2 \).

Now let's perform this calculation:

\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \]

So, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is **$4.00**.

**Step 3: Add the costs together to get the total cost.**

Total cost = Cost for the first 16 minutes + Cost for the remaining 20 minutes.

   C + (3C - 2) = 10
   \]
   Simplify this equation:
   \[
   C + 3C - 2 = 10
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   4C - 2 = 10
   \]

6. **Solve for \( C \):**
   Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   4C = 12
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   C = 3
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   Carly made 3 cupcakes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]<|im_end|>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

To determine how much Karen will pay for her services, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost before any discounts.
2. Apply the 20% discount for getting both mani/pedi.
3. Add the additional cost for nail art.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total cost before any discounts:**
   - Manicure cost = $35
   - Pedicure cost = $40
   - Total cost without discount = $35 + $40 = $75

2. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - Discount amount = 20% of $75 = 0.20 * $75 = $15
   - Cost after applying the discount = $75 - $15 = $60

3. **Add the cost of nail art:**
   - Nail art cost per finger = $3
   - Number of fingers (including hands) = 12 (assuming 12 fingers per hand)
   - Total cost for nail art = $3 * 12 = $36

4. **Final calculation:**
   - Final total cost = Cost after discount + Cost of nail art = $60 + $36 = $96

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $96.<|im_end|>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.

The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Susan orders three different magazines.
- Each of these magazines sends a certain number of issues per year.

### Step 2: Determine the number of issues for each magazine
- The first magazine sends 12 issues per year.
- The second magazine sends 6 issues per year.
- The third magazine sends 4 times as many issues as the second magazine.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of issues from the third magazine
\[ \text{Issues from third magazine} = 4 \times (\text{issues from second magazine}) \]
\[ \text{Issues from third magazine} = 4 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Issues from third magazine} = 24 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all the issues
Now, let’s add up the total number of issues from all three magazines to find out how many issues in total Susan receives per year.

\[ \text{Total issues} = \text{issues from first magazine} + \text{issues from second magazine} + \text{issues from third magazine} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of paintings that Samantha has.
Samantha has 27 paintings.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of paintings that Shelley has.
Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding 12 to the number of paintings Samantha has.

\[
\text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12
\]

Substitute the given value for Samantha's paintings:

\[
\text{Shelley's paintings} = 27 + 12 = 39
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of paintings that Kim has.
We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, we need to subtract 8 from the number of paintings Shelley has to find out how many paintings Kim has.

\[
\text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8
\]

Substitute the calculated value for Shelley's paintings:

\[
\text{Kim's paintings} = 39 - 8 = 31

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new price after the increase in December**.
2. **Apply the decrease in January to the increased price from Step 1**.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the new price after the increase in December

- Initial price of the toy in November = $40
- Increase in December = 80% of the initial price

\[
\text{Increase amount} = \text{Initial Price} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Increase amount} = 40 \times \frac{80}{100} = 40 \times 0.8 = 32
\]

So, the new price after the increase in December is:

\[
\text{New Price} = \text{Initial Price} + \text{Increase Amount} = 40 + 32 = 72
\]

### Step 2: Apply the decrease in January to the increased price from Step 1

- Decrease in January = 50% of the new price

\[
\text{Decrease amount} = \text{New Price} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Decrease}}{100}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Decrease amount} = 72 \times \frac{50}{100} = 72 \times 0.5 = 36
\]

So, the final price after the decrease in January is:

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{New Price} - \text{Decrease Amount} = 72 - 36 = 36
\]

Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $\boxed{36}$.<|im_end|>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

To determine the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of one lesson.
2. Determine the reduced rate for a veteran lesson.
3. Calculate the total cost for the 4 standard lessons.
4. Calculate the total cost for the 2 veteran lessons.
5. Sum the costs from both types of lessons.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the cost of one lesson:**
   - The standard fee is $80 per hour.
   - So, the cost of one lesson (whether it's a regular or veteran lesson) is $80.

2. **Determine the reduced rate for a veteran lesson:**
   - When giving lessons to a veteran, the rate is reduced by 25%.
   - A reduction of 25% means that the veteran lesson costs only 75% of the standard rate.
   - Therefore, the reduced rate for a veteran lesson is \(80 \times 0.75 = 60\) dollars per hour.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the 4 standard lessons:**
   - Since there are 4 standard lessons, each costing $80, the total cost for the standard lessons is \(4 \times 80 = 320\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost for the 2 veteran lessons:**
   - Each veteran lesson costs $60, so for 2 lessons, the total cost is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) dollars.

5. **Sum the costs from both types of lessons:**
   - The total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(320 + 120 = 440\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $\boxed{440}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
Reducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.
Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

Summing these up:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Calculating this sum:
\[
50 + 80 = 130 \\
130 + 80 = 210 \\
210 + 60 = 270 \\
270 + 40 = 310 \\

400 + 100 = 500 \\
500 + 70 = 570 \\
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of the scores is 630.

**Step 2:** Count the number of scores.

There are 10 scores in total (from 50 to 100).

**Step 3:** Divide the total sum by the number of scores.

Mean score = Total sum / Number of scores
\[ Mean = \frac{630}{10} \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written over her two years.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the information given, the number of novels she wrote last year (which is 9 novels) represents 3/4 of the total number of novels she has written this year.
   
   So, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x = 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
   \[
   x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}

   - To find out how much of the 6000 km distance Michael covers in 72 hours, divide the total travel time by the total distance:

   \[

   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   \text{Fraction Covered} = \frac{72}{120} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

5. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**

   \[
   \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 100\% = 60\%

                    question:
                    Madeline ate . 6 grapes. Her ! brother . wanted to make grape juice and used . up 5 times . as many . grapes : then Madeline , to make . a full glass.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used.
Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline did. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of grapes initially available.
Madeline had 6 grapes. Her brother used 30 grapes. Therefore, the initial number of grapes was:
\[ 6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many grapes were left after making the pies.
Their mother made 4 pies using the remaining grapes. Each pie requires 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes needed for the pies is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

Since they only have 36 grapes in total, it seems there might be an error because they can't make 4 pies with just 36 grapes. Let's re-evaluate the initial assumption.

Given that their mother made 4 pies but only had enough grapes to make 3 pies (since \(4 \times 12 = 48\) which exceeds the 36 grapes), let's assume she made exactly 3 pies. Then:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ grapes} \]

So, after making 3 pies, there should be no grapes left over.

### Step 4: Re-evaluate the initial condition.
If they made exactly 3 pies, then there would indeed be 36 grapes initially, but the question states that they made more than 3 pies. This indicates there was an oversight or misinterpretation in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement regarding the number of pies made. If we assume they made exactly 3 pies and ran out of grapes, then the correct initial number of grapes must be 36. However, since they made more than 3 pies, the problem does not align with the given data.

Therefore, the correct interpretation based on the provided information is that the initial number of grapes was 36, but the problem statement about making 4 pies implies a mistake in the problem setup.

Given the constraints of the problem and assuming they made exactly 3 pies, the final answer is:

To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School on that particular day, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of teachers**: We know there were 82 teachers.
2. **Number of teachers who were sick**: It was stated that 13 out of the 82 teachers were sick.

Given these facts, we can deduce the number of teachers present at school as follows:

- First, subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers: \( 82 - 13 = 69 \).
- This calculation gives us the number of teachers who were not sick but should be present at school.

Since the question asks for the number of teachers at school on that specific day, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 69.<|im_end|>","There were 82 – 13 = <<82-13=69>>69 regular teachers at school.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost per serving.
2. Determine the total number of servings in a year.
3. Multiply the cost per serving by the total number of servings.

Step 1: Cost per serving

- Pasta: $1.00 per box (assuming a standard box size)
- Cheddar cheese: $3.00 per serving
- Gruyère cheese: Twice as much as cheddar = $6.00 per serving

Total cost per serving = Pasta + Cheddar + Gruyère
= $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
= $10.00

Step 2: Total number of servings in a year

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, there are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of servings in a year is:
52 servings/week × 1 meal/month × 12 months/year = 672 meals/year

Step 3: Total spending over the course of a year

Now, multiply the total cost per serving by the total number of servings in a year:
$10.00 per serving × 672 servings/year = $6,720.00/year

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: $6,720.00/year.<|im_end|>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total time required to clean all classrooms**

- Number of classrooms = 80
- Time taken to clean one classroom = 15 minutes
- Total time required to clean all classrooms = 80 * 15 = 1200 minutes

Convert the total time into hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{1200}{60} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many hours are available for cleaning**

- Days available for cleaning = 5
- Hours per day = 8
- Total hours available for cleaning = 5 * 8 = 40 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the number of hours spent cleaning**

- Time spent cleaning = Total time - Available hours
- Time spent cleaning = 20 - (5 * 8) = 20 - 40 = -20 (This indicates there's no valid calculation since you can't spend more than the total time available)

Since the above calculation results in negative values, it suggests that the custodian will not be able to finish cleaning within the given time frame.

However, let’s re-evaluate the approach because if they cannot finish within the available time, then they won’t spend any time cleaning at all. Therefore, they will not spend any hours cleaning during the day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of each shelf
- Bottom shelf: Can hold \( x \) books.
- Middle shelves (2): Can hold 10 books each.
- Top shelf: Can hold \( x - 5 \) books.

Given that the bottom shelf holds twice as many books as one middle shelf, we have:
\[ x = 2 \times 10 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, the bottom shelf can hold 20 books.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of books per shelf
- Bottom shelf: 20 books.
- Middle shelves: 10 books each.
- Top shelf: \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

### Step 3: Sum up the total capacity
Total capacity for all shelves combined:
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of bookcases needed
Elly has 110 books in total. To find out how many bookcases she needs, divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Since the result is an integer, she will need exactly 2 bookcases to hold all 110 books.

### Conclusion
Elly needs **2** bookcases to hold all of her books.<|im_end|>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rose bought**
Rose bought five dozens of eggs. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many eggs Rose wants to sell**
She plans to sell her eggs in packs of three per pack.

First, let’s find out how many such packs she can make from 60 eggs:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ packs} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue Rose expects to earn if sold at $1 per pack**
If she sells 20 packs at $1 per pack, then her expected revenue would be:
\[ 20 \times 1 = \$20 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost Rose incurred**
Rose spent $2.40 on buying 60 eggs.

**Step 5: Calculate the profit**
Profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
Substituting the values obtained:
\[ \$20 - \$2.40 = \$17.60 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[
\boxed{\$17.60}
\]<|im_end|>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.

2. **Determine the discount amount**:
   The discount is $3.00 on a bag.

3. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( S \)**

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary has made 20 strawberry cubes.

**Step 4: Find \( B \)**

Now substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary has made 96 blueberry cubes.

**Final Answer:**
{The final answer is} 96 blueberry cubes.<|im_end|>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

\[ \text{Total number of games} = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of games} = 160 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total points scored
Each game awards 21 points to Ara!. Therefore:

\[ \text{Total points} = \text{Total number of games} \times \text{Points per game} \]

Substituting the calculated value from Step 1:

\[ \text{Total points} = 160 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Total points} = 3360 \]

### Final Answer
The total number of points that Ara! has scored in the four years is \boxed{3360}.<|im_end|>","Forty games every year translates to 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 games in four years.

To determine how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles.
2. **Marbles dropped**: He drops half of his marbles, which means he loses \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) marbles. So now he has \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) marbles left.
3. **Lost beads**: He finds that one of the remaining marbles was not a marble, so he discards it. Now he has \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) marbles left.
4. **Final count after removing non-marbles**: After inspecting further, he removes one more non-movable marble (the bead), leaving him with \( 4 - 1 = 3 \) marbles.

Therefore, the final number of marbles Brendan ends up with is \( 3 \).

                    question:
                    Jason works , as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars while earning a bonus, let's break down the process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of people needed to visit the dealership.
Jason aims to sell 15 cars. According to historical averages, for every 25 telephone calls made, he gets one customer who visits the dealership.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of telephone calls required.
If he needs 15 customers in total and he gets one customer per 25 telephone calls, then we can set up a proportion to find out how many calls he needs to make.

\[
\frac{25 \text{ calls}}{1 \text{ customer}} = \frac{x \text{ calls}}{15 \text{ customers}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{25 \times 15}{1} = 375 \text{ calls}
\]

So, Jason needs to make **375 telephone calls** to get 15 customers.

### Step 3: Verify if this meets the dealership’s requirement.
Since he only needs 375 calls and he has already determined that he needs 375 calls, it confirms that making 375 telephone calls will indeed lead him to having exactly 15 customers (one for each call).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{Jason needs to make 375 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.}}
\]<|im_end|>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine total number of people:**
   - There are 4 people living in the house.

2. **Calculate the number of flashlights needed:**
   - Each person needs a flashlight.
   - Number of flashlights = Number of people = 4

3. **Calculate the number of flashlights per room:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Total flashlights required = Flashlights per person * Number of people = 4 * 4 = 16

4. **Calculate the number of flashlights needed per room:**
   - Since the number of flashlights per room should be the same across all rooms, we divide the total number of flashlights by the number of rooms.
   - Flashlights per room = Total flashlights / Number of rooms = 16 / 8 = 2

5. **Calculate the number of flashlights per room (revised):**
   - We need to find out how many flashlights are needed per room considering that they can share them among themselves.
   - Let’s assume each room has \( n \) flashlights shared among the residents.
   - Since the flashlights are distributed equally among the rooms, let's calculate based on the distribution of flashlights within the rooms.

6. **Calculate the number of candles needed:**
   - For the small candles: 
     - There are 4 small candles, each for half of the rooms.
     - Half of the rooms = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
     - Therefore, each room gets 1 small candle.
     - Total small candles needed = Small candles per room * Number of rooms = 1 * 8 = 8

7. **Calculate the number of medium candles needed:**
   - There are 5 medium candles, each for the other half of the rooms.
   - Other half of the rooms = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
   - Therefore, each room gets 1 medium candle.
   - Total medium candles needed = Medium candles per room * Number of rooms = 1 * 8 = 8

8. **Sum up the total number of candles and flashlights used:**
   - Total candles used = Small candles + Medium candles = 8 + 8 = 16
   - Total flashlights used = Flashlights per person * Number of people = 4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, when the lights go out, Brianna's family uses a total of 16 candles and 16 flashlights. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 16 candles and 16 flashlights.<|im_end|>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chips:**
   - Mitchell buys two bags of chips.
   - Each bag contains 55 chips.
   - Total number of chips = Number of bags × Chips per bag
   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 2 \times 55 = 110
   \]

2. **Determine the number of people in Mitchell's family:**
   - The problem states that Mitchell has five members in his family.

3. **Divide the total number of chips equally among the family members:**
   - To find out how many chips each person gets, divide the total number of chips by the number of family members.
   \[
   \text{Chips per person} = \frac{\text{Total chips}}{\text{Number of people}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Chips per person} = \frac{110}{5}

To determine how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Time for the first side:**
   - According to the problem, it takes John 5 minutes to solve one side.
   
2. **Time for the second and third sides:**
   - Each of these two sides takes twice as long as the first side.
   - Time for the second side = \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) minutes.
   - Time for the third side = \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) minutes.

3. **Time for the fourth and fifth sides:**
   - These two sides each take half the time of the first side.
   - Time for the fourth side = \( 5 / 2 = 2.5 \) minutes.
   - Time for the fifth side = \( 2.5 \) minutes (same as the fourth side).

4. **Total time calculation:**
   - Add up all the times calculated above:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 5 + 10 + 20 + 2.5 + 2.5
     \]

Now we perform the addition:

\[

\]
\[
15 + 20 = 35
\]
\[
35 + 2.5 = 37.5

   - There are 20 helmets.

2. **Determine the relationship between the number of helmets and other items:**
   - The number of helmets is half the number of robots.
   - The number of robots is also half the number of footballs.

3. **Calculate the number of robots:**
   - Since there are 20 helmets and the number of robots is twice that (because robots = 2 * helmets), we have:
     \[
     \text{Number of robots} = 40

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of phone calls Tim makes in one day.
- Tim works for 6 hours each day.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 6 hours equals \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \) minutes.

Since it takes Tim 15 minutes to handle one call, the number of calls he can make in one day is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of calls per day} = \frac{\text{Total time available}}{\text{Time per call}}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Number of calls per day} = \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\text{Number of calls per day} = \frac{360}{15}
\]

\[
\text{Number of calls per day} = 24
\]

So, Tim handles 24 calls in one day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of phone calls in one week.
- Since there are 7 days in a week, multiply the number of calls made in one day by 7:

\[
\text{Total calls in a week} = \text{Number of calls per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total calls in a week} = 24 \times 7
\]

Calculate:

\[
\text{Total calls in a week} = 168
\]

Therefore, Tim deals with **168** calls during his 5-day work week.<|im_end|>","He spends 6*60=<<6*60=360>>360 minutes dealing with calls

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total drying time required for both scenarios (old and new varnishes) and then find the difference between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Old Varnish Scenario:
1. **Drying Time per Painting**: The old varnish dries in 7 minutes.
2. **Number of Paintings**: 6 paintings.
3. **Total Drying Time**:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Minutes per Painting} \times \text{Number of Paintings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 7 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 42 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### New Varnish Scenario:
1. **Drying Time per Painting**: The new varnish dries in 12 minutes.
2. **Number of Paintings**: 6 paintings.
3. **Total Drying Time**:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Minutes per Painting} \times \text{Number of Paintings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 12 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### Difference in Total Drying Times:
1. **Difference**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Time with New Varnish} - \text{Total Time with Old Varnish}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 72 - 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

                    Crista's plants need to be watered every day. She has 20 plants. 4 of her plants need half of a cup of water. 8 ? plants need 1 cup of water. The rest need a quarter of a cup of water. How many cups of water does Crista need every day for her plants?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of plants:**
   Crista has 20 plants.

2. **Determine the number of plants that need different amounts of water:**
   - 4 plants need half of a cup of water.
   - 8 plants need one cup of water.

3. **Calculate the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:**
   Since Crista has 20 plants in total, the remaining number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of plants needing a quarter of a cup} = 20 - (4 + 8) = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]

4. **Sum up all the water requirements:**
   - Plants needing half a cup: \(4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2\) cups per plant.
   - Plants needing one cup: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups per plant.
   - Plants needing a quarter of a cup: \(8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2\) cups per plant.

5. **Add up all the individual contributions to find the total amount of water needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = (2 \times 4) + (8 \times 1) + (2 \times 8)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 8 + 8 + 16 = 32 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Crista needs a total of 32 cups of water every day for her plants.<|im_end|>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups

Since 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water, she will need 2 cups of water for these plants because .25*8=<<.25*8=2>>2 cups.
In total, she will need 2+8+2=<<2+8+2=12>>12 cups of water per day.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total distance Phineas needs to travel**
- Phineas lives 200 yards from his home.
- Half of the journey (50 yards) is on land.
- Half of the journey (50 yards) is in water.

So, Phineas needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards.

**Step 2: Calculate the time for the journey on land**
- Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
- He has to cover 50 yards on land.

Time = Distance / Speed
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{land}} = \frac{50 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} = 2.5 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time for the journey in water**
- Phineas swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
- He has to cover another 50 yards in water.

Time = Distance / Speed
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{water}} = \frac{50 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Add up the times for both parts of the journey**
Total time = Time on land + Time in water
\[ \text{Total time} = 2.5 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 7.5 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Phineas will need **7.5 minutes** to return home.<|im_end|>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks needed.
2. Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks needed.
Bob wants to recreate the Washington Monument using popsicle sticks. The exact dimensions aren't necessary for this calculation since we only need the total number of popsicle sticks.

Total number of popsicle sticks = 56

Step 2: Determine how many boxes of popsicle sticks are required.
Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes are needed, divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box.

Number of boxes = Total number of popsicle sticks / Popsicle sticks per box
= 56 / 8
= 7

Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes.
Each box costs $2.00. Since Bob needs 7 boxes, multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box
= 7 × $2.00
= $14.00

Therefore, the total amount Bob will spend on building his project is $14.00.<|im_end|>","He needs 56 popsicle sticks to build his project and they come 8 to a box so he needs 56/8 = <<56/8=7>>7 boxes

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the phone plans considering that the main phone plan costs twice as much as each additional phone plan.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Main phone plan costs: $20.
   - Additional phone plans cost half of the main phone plan's price.

2. **Calculate the cost of one additional phone plan:**
   - Since the main phone plan costs $20 and there are five phones (plans), the main phone plan costs twice as much as each additional phone plan.
   \[
   20 = 2 \times \text{cost of one additional phone plan}
   \]
   - Solving for the cost of one additional phone plan:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one additional phone plan} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Determine the number of additional phone plans:**
   - With five phones (plans) in total, there are four additional phone plans since one is the main plan.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all phone plans:**
   - Cost of the main phone plan: $20.
   - Cost of the four additional phone plans: $10 per plan.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$20 + (\$10 \times 4)
   \]
   - Simplifying the expression:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$20 + \$40 = \$60

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total cost of the phone plans is $60.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Derrick makes from selling his doughnuts in June, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts produced.
- Derrick produces 10 dozen doughnuts.
- Since 1 dozen equals 12, we convert dozens to individual units.
\[ \text{Total doughnuts} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \]

### Step 2: Determine the daily sales revenue.
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling one doughnut is $2.

Since there are 120 doughnuts, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:
\[ \text{Daily revenue} = 120 \times \$2 = \$240 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of days in June.
June typically has 30 days.

### Step 4: Compute the total revenue over the entire month.
- To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, multiply the daily revenue by the number of days in June.
\[ \text{Total revenue in June} = \$240 \times 30 = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes $\boxed{7200}$ dollars in June if he sells all the doughnuts.<|im_end|>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of photos**: Jade has taken 210 photos.

2. **Photos per batch**: Jade plans to upload 7 photos in one batch.

3. **Number of batches per day**: She uploads 6 batches each day.

4. **Calculate total photos uploaded per day**:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for one week
First, we need to determine the total cost for one week.

- **Blouses**: Alicia has 5 blouses.
  - Cost per blouse = $5.00
  - Total cost for blouses = 5 × $5.00 = $25.00

- **Pants**: Alicia has 1 pair of pants.
  - Cost per pant = $8.00
  - Total cost for pants = 1 × $8.00 = $8.00

- **Skirt**: Alicia has 1 skirt.
  - Cost per skirt = $6.00
  - Total cost for skirt = 1 × $6.00 = $6.00

Now, add up all these costs to get the total weekly cost:
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = \$25.00 (\text{blouses}) + \$8.00 (\text{pants}) + \$6.00 (\text{skirt}) \]
\[ \text{Total weekly cost} = \$49.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for five weeks
Next, we calculate the total cost for five weeks:
\[ \text{Total cost for five weeks} = \$49.00 (\text{weekly cost}) \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for five weeks} = \$245.00 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Alicia spends $245.00 on dry cleaning over 5 weeks.

\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes John to read 10 pages after he has increased his typing speed from 150 words per minute (WPM) to 375 WPM.

Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate the new typing speed:**
   - John's original typing speed is 150 WPM.
   - He increases his speed by a factor of 2.5.
   \[
   \text{New typing speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of words in 10 pages:**
   - Each page contains 450 words.
   - There are 10 pages.
   \[
   \text{Total words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required at the new speed:**
   - We know that John types at 375 WPM.
   - The formula to calculate time (\(t\)) when given speed (\(v\)), distance (\(d\)), and rate (\(\frac{d}{t}\)):
     \[
     t = \frac{d}{v}
     \]
   - Here, \(d\) (distance) is the total number of words (4500), and \(v\) (speed) is 375 WPM.
   \[
   t = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes}
   \]

So, it would take John 12 minutes to type out 10 pages at his improved typing speed.<|im_end|>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the number of people on the second day.
2. Determine the number of people on the third day.
3. Calculate the total number of people over the five days.

Let's start with the first day:

Step 1: Number of people on the first day
Conor found 50 people on the first day.

Step 2: Number of people on the second day
On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day. So,
\[ \text{Number of people on the second day} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Step 3: Number of people on the third day
On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day. So,
\[ \text{Number of people on the third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \]

Step 4: Average number of people per day for the rest of the week
We know that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day during the rest of the week (i.e., from the fourth to the fifth day).

Since there are 3 days left in the week (after the first three), and we assume these days fall within the same week as the others, the total number of people over the five days would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total number of people} = (\text{Number of people on the first day}) + (\text{Number of people on the second day}) + (\text{Number of people on the third day}) + (\text{Average number of people per day for the rest of the week}) \]
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 \]

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 60 = 320 \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \(320\). Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{320}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Popping Rate**: Let's denote the initial popping rate as \( R \).

2. **First 30 Seconds**:
   - Number of pops: 20
   - Time (in seconds): 30
   - Popping rate: \( \frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3} \) per second

3. **Next 30 Seconds**:
   - Three times the initial rate.
   - Popping rate: \( 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \) per second

4. **Next 30 Seconds**:
   - Four times the initial rate.
   - Popping rate: \( 4 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \) per second

5. **Final 30 Seconds**:
   - Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds.
   - Popping rate: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \) per second

6. **Total Popped**:
   - First 30 seconds: 20 pops
   - Next 30 seconds: 20 pops * 3 = 60 pops
   - Final 30 seconds: 60 pops / 2 = 30 pops

7. **Total Popped**:
   - Total popped = 20 + 60 + 30 = 110 pops

8. **Residual Heat**:
   - After taking the pan off the heat, half of the final 30-second pops still pop.
   - Number of pops remaining after 30 seconds = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

9. **Total Popcorn**:
   - Initial popping + Residual popping = \( 110 + 15 = 125 \) pieces

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is **125**.<|im_end|>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.
Thus, Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = <<20+60+80+40+10=210>>210 pieces of popcorn to eat.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much lemon juice Tim needs for one gallon of lemonade.
2. Calculate how many lemons are needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.
3. Determine how many lemons are needed for Tim's extra gallon of lemonade (twice as tart).
4. Sum up all the lemons required.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of lemon juice per gallon.
From the given information, 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. Since there are 8 cups in a gallon, 1 cup of juice requires \( \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4} \) lemons. Therefore, for 1 gallon, Tim needs \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) lemons.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of lemons needed for 4 gallons.
For 4 gallons, Tim needs \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) lemons.

Step 3: Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon.
Since the extra gallon should be twice as tart, it will require twice as much lemon juice. The extra gallon will thus need \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) lemons.

Step 4: Sum up all the lemons required.
Total lemons needed = Lemons for 4 gallons + Lemons for extra gallon = 24 + 12 = 36 lemons.

Therefore, Tim will need **36 lemons**.<|im_end|>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the daily consumption for each type of dog:**
   - A German Shepherd consumes 5 kg of dog food per day.
   - A Bulldog consumes 3 kg of dog food per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily consumption for all dogs combined:**
   - There are 3 German Shepherds.
   - There are 2 Bulldogs.
   
   Total consumption = (Number of German Shepherds * Consumption per German Shepherd) + (Number of Bulldogs * Consumption per Bulldog)
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = (3 \times 5) + (2 \times 3) = 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   
   Weekly consumption = Total daily consumption × Number of days in a week
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption} = 21 \times 7 = 147 \text{ kg}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of two-legged animals.
We know that there are 10 two-legged animals.

### Step 2: Determine the number of four-legged animals.
We know that there are 15 four-legged animals.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs from both groups.
- From the two-legged animals: \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \) legs.
- From the four-legged animals: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs.

### Step 4: Add the total number of legs from both groups to get the total number of legs.
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \]

So, the total number of legs on all the animals combined is **80**.

### Step 5: Determine the number of pairs of legs.
Since each pair consists of 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2 to find out how many pairs of legs there are.
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is **40**.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 4 blue blocks.
   - There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of red blocks.

2. **Calculate the number of yellow blocks:**
   Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks}
   \]
   Given that there are 4 blue blocks:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total number of blocks:**
   The total number of blocks is the sum of blue, yellow, and red blocks:
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = \text{Blue blocks} + \text{Yellow blocks} + \text{Red blocks}
   \]
   We know the total is 32 blocks:
   \[
   32 = 4 + 8 + x

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Combine the known quantities (blue and yellow):
   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]
   So,
   \[
   12 + x = 32
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total distance traveled**

Elvis drives in two segments:
- Westward travel: 5 hours at 18 mph
- Eastward return trip: 8 hours at 18 mph

First, calculate the distance traveled to the west:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Westward Distance} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Westward Distance} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Next, calculate the distance traveled back home (eastward):
\[ \text{Eastward Distance} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Eastward Distance} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

Now, add these distances together to find the total distance from Elvis's starting point.
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Westward Distance} + \text{Eastward Distance} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 90 \text{ miles} + 144 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 234 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Elvis is **234 miles away** from his house after completing the journey.

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Value**: The initial value of the boat is $9,000.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - Calculate the amount of depreciation: \( 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \).
   - Subtract the depreciation from the initial value: \( 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \).

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year.
   - Calculate the amount of depreciation: \( 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \).
   - Subtract the depreciation from the current value: \( 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \).

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year.
   - Calculate the amount of depreciation: \( 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \).
   - Subtract the depreciation from the current value: \( 4410 - 882 = 3528 \).

2. **Determine the number of red candies:**
   We know there are 54 red candies.

3. **Calculate the number of orange candies:**
   The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies.
   \[
   \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bus trips
Helen took the bus 7 times.

### Step 2: Determine the cost per bus trip
Each bus trip costs 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel.
- The cost of one night at the hotel = $80
- Cost per bus trip = 10% of $80
- Cost per bus trip = $80 * (10/100) = $8

Now we need to calculate the total cost for all bus trips:
\[ \text{Total bus cost} = 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hotel stays
The total cost of staying at the hotel is given as $80 per night for 3 nights.
\[ \text{Total hotel stay cost} = 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total costs
- Total cost of hotels: $240
- Total cost of buses: $56

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

\[ x + y = 21 \]
where \( y \) represents the number of marbles Dallas received from Mazie.

Since Dallas dropped 4 marbles, we can write:
\[ y - 4 = 21 \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 21 + 4 \]
\[ y = 25 \]

So, Dallas originally received 25 marbles from Mazie.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of marbles given to Darla**

Now we know that Dallas originally received 25 marbles. Since Dallas and Darla share the same amount of marbles, Darla also received 25 marbles from Mazie.

Therefore, the number of marbles given to Darla is **25**.<|im_end|>","Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.
Darla has 52 - 25 = <<52-25=27>>27 marbles.

                    A family of ? parents and a child go to the cinema. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and a child ticket is $8. Then they buy 2 popcorns , for ! $3 each. How many dollars do they pay in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent on tickets and popcorn.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of adults:**
   - Let's denote the number of adults as \(A\).
   - Since there is one child, the total number of people (adults + children) is 3.
   - Therefore, \(A + 1 = 3\) implies that \(A = 2\).

2. **Calculate the total cost of adult tickets:**
   - Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - There are 2 adults, so the total cost for adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of child tickets:**
   - Each child ticket costs $8.
   - There is 1 child, so the total cost for child tickets is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total cost of popcorn:**
   - They bought 2 popcorns at $3 each.
   - Therefore, the total cost for popcorn is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

5. **Add up all the costs:**
   - Total cost from adult tickets: $24
   - Total cost from child tickets: $8
   - Total cost from popcorn: $6
   - Adding these together gives us the total amount paid: 
     \[
     24 + 8 + 6 = 38
     \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{38}\).<|im_end|>","Adult tickets cost 12*2=$<<12*2=24>>24
Popcorns cost 2*3=$<<2*3=6>>6
They pay 24+8+6=$<<24+8+6=38>>38 in total.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the car:**
   - The car itself weighs 1200 pounds.
   - Luggage weighs 250 pounds.
   - Children weigh 75 pounds each (totaling 150 pounds since there are two children).

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the force required to move the car:**
   - The force needed to move the car is given as 1% of its total weight.

   \[
   \text{Force} = 0.01 \times 1600 = 16 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the force that John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {16}.<|im_end|>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much crepe paper James needs, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence.
Perimeter (P) of a rectangle = 2 * (length + width)
Given length (L) = 20 feet, width (W) = 15 feet,
P = 2 * (20 + 15) = 2 * 35 = 70 feet.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of crepe paper needed based on the perimeter.
Since James wants to hang streamers along the entire perimeter of the fence, he will need 70 feet of crepe paper.

Final Answer: James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine Emma's current age.
Since Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age and Mia is 40 years old, we can calculate Emma's age by adding 16 years to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16
Emma's age = 56 years

Step 2: Calculate the average of their ages.
We have two ages: Mia's age (40) and Emma's age (56).

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 + 56) / 2
Average age = 96 / 2
Average age = 48

Therefore, the average of their ages is **48**.<|im_end|>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the place settings Avery needs to buy for her dinner party. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the dinner plates.
- Avery needs two dinner plates per person.
- There are 12 people attending the dinner.

Total number of dinner plates needed = \( 12 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ plates/person} = 24 \text{ plates} \).

Cost of one dinner plate = $6.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the dinner plates = \( 24 \text{ plates} \times \$6.00/\text{plate} = \$144.00 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the salad plates.
- The salad plates cost $4.00 each.

Total number of salad plates needed = \( 12 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ salad plate/person} = 12 \text{ plates} \).

Cost of one salad plate = $4.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the salad plates = \( 12 \text{ plates} \times \$4.00/\text{plate} = \$48.00 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the bowls.
- Avery needs one bowl per person.

Total number of bowls needed = \( 12 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ bowl/person} = 12 \text{ bowls} \).

Cost of one bowl = $5.00.

Therefore, the total cost for the bowls = \( 12 \text{ bowls} \times \$5.00/\text{bowl} = \$60.00 \).

### Step 4: Add up all the costs.
- Cost of dinner plates: $144.00
- Cost of salad plates: $48.00
- Cost of bowls: $60.00

Total cost = \( \$144.00 + \$48.00 + \$60.00 = \$252.00 \).

### Conclusion:
Avery will spend a total of **$252.00** on the place settings for her dinner party.<|im_end|>","Each place setting will need a dinner plate that’s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that’s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00
She needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.

   - Steve spent 10 hours on the puzzle.

2. **Determine half of Steve's time:**
   - Half of Steve's time is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \) hours.
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Add 2 hours to half of Steve's time to find out how much longer Anna worked:**
   - Anna worked 2 hours more than half of Steve’s time.
     \[
     5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Sum up the total time Anna spent working:**
   - Anna worked for 7 hours plus her additional 2 hours.
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: It took Anna to finish the puzzle in 9 hours.<|im_end|>","Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed consumed per pig per day:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed.
   - This happens twice a day.

2. **Determine the daily consumption for all pigs:**
   - There are 5 pigs.
   - Each pig consumes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds per day.

3. **Calculate the weekly consumption for all pigs:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The total number of days is \(7 \times 5 = 35\) days (since there are 5 pigs).

4. **Sum up the total feed consumed over the week:**
   - Each pig consumes 8 pounds per day.
   - Therefore, the total for all pigs over the week is \(35 \times 8 = 280\) pounds.

5. **Subtract the total consumed from the initial amount of feed ordered:**
   - Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed initially.
   - After consuming 280 pounds, the remaining amount is \(300 - 280 = 20\) pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 20 pounds of feed left after a week.<|im_end|>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.

To determine how much money Frances has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total earnings from cupcakes**
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes.
- Each cupcake is sold for $2.

\[
\text{Total earnings from cupcakes} = 20 \times 2 = \$40
\]

**Step 2: Calculate total earnings from cookies**
- Frances sells 40 cookies.

To solve this problem, let's break down the situation step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of children**: There are initially 5 children.
   
2. **First Street**: After reaching the end of the first street, these 5 children chase the truck. No new children join them at this point.

3. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children on the first street joins one more child, so we add 5 more children to the group (since each of the 5 children gets one additional child).

4. **Third Street**: Now, the total number of children in the group is \(5 + 5 = 10\). Each of these 10 children is then joined by two more children. So, for every child, 2 more join.

   - For the first 5 children: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) new children join.
   - For the next 5 children: \(5 \times 2 = 10\) new children join.

   Therefore, the total number of children joining at the third street is \(10 + 10 = 20\).

5. **Total children following the truck after the third street**: Initially, there were 5 children, then 10 more joined, and finally 20 more joined.

So, the total number of children following the truck after all streets is \(5 + 10 + 20 = 35\).

                    question:
                    The recent floods in Mamou’s country have left many families without food or shelter. , To help, Mamou has volunteered to distribute 1,360 meals to the affected families. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. How many meals does she have left to distribute?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many meals Mamou still needs to distribute after giving out some over the weekend, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Total Meals Distributed:
First, calculate the total number of meals distributed during the three days.

1. **Friday:**
   - Number of meals given = 64

2. **Saturday:**
   - Number of meals given = 30

3. **Sunday:**
   - Number of meals given = 48

Now, add up all the meals distributed:
\[
64 + 30 + 48
\]

Perform the addition:
\[
64 + 30 = 94
\]
\[
94 + 48 = 142
\]

So, the total number of meals distributed so far is 142.

#### Initial Meal Distribution:
Mamou initially had 1,360 meals available for distribution.

#### Calculate Remaining Meals:
Subtract the number of meals already distributed from the initial amount:
\[
1360 - 142
\]

Perform the subtraction:
\[
1360 - 142 = 1218
\]

Therefore, Mamou has \( \boxed{1218} \) meals left to distribute.<|im_end|>","On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Mamou distributed a total of 64 meals + 30 meals + 48 meals = <<64+30+48=142>>142 meals

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to convert all the coins into their respective values (in cents) and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the value of each type of coin:**
   - A quarter = 25 cents
   - A nickel = 5 cents
   - A dime = 10 cents

2. **Calculate the total value of the coins found:**
   - Quarter: \( 25 \text{ cents} \)
   - Nickels: \( 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents} \)
   - Dimes: \( 7 \times 10 \text{ cents} = 70 \text{ cents} \)

3. **Sum the values of all coins:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount in cents} = 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Verify that the total matches the given information:**
   - The total should be consistent with the given information about the coins found.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of children in the family:**
   - There are 2 brothers.
   - The rest are sisters.
   
   Therefore, the total number of children (sisters) = 3.

2. **Determine the ages of the children:**
   - We know that one sister is 16 years old.
   - We also know that the other two sisters are the same age as the younger brother, who is 12 years old.
   - Since the younger brother's age is half the age of the older brother, we can confirm that the older brother is indeed 24 years old (because \(12 \times 2 = 24\)).

3. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
   - Total number of children = 2 brothers + 3 sisters = 5.
   - Sum of their ages:
     - Younger brother: 12 years old.
     - Older brother: 24 years old.
     - Sister aged 16 years old.
     
     So, the total age = \(12 + 24 + 16 = 52\).

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings is 52 years.<|im_end|>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.

So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

<|im_start|>user

To determine the total amount of time Charisma spends on both meditation and yoga over four weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent on meditation:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes every morning.
   - She also meditates for 15 minutes after waking up at night.
   - Therefore, her total daily meditation time is \(15 \text{ minutes} + 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Determine the weekly time spent on meditation:**
   - Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) five times a week.
   - Therefore, her total weekly meditation time is \(60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week}\).

3. **Convert the weekly time into hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, her weekly meditation time in hours is \( \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours/week}\).

4. **Calculate the total time spent on meditation over four weeks:**
   - Over four weeks, her total meditation time is \(5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours}\).

Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation over four weeks is \(\boxed{20 \text{ hours}}\).<|im_end|>","She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night for a total of 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes

3. **Calculate the area covered by large shirts:**
   - Each large shirt covers 6 square feet.
   - Octavia has 6 large shirts.
   \[
   \text{Area covered by large shirts} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ square feet}

   - Since one dozen equals 12, three dozens equal \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) seeds.

2. **Determine how many seeds a large sunflower contains:**
   - A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - To find 50% of the small sunflower’s seeds, calculate \( 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \).
   - Add this to the total number of seeds from the small sunflower: \( 36 + 18 = 54 \).

3. **Sum up all the seeds:**
   - Small sunflower: 36 seeds.
   - Large sunflower: 54 seeds.

- George has 18 pens.
- Therefore, Timothy has \(3 \times 18 = 54\) pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pens Sarah has.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Anne's height:**
   - We know that Anne is twice the size of Albert.
   - Albert is 36 inches tall.
   - Therefore, Anne's height = 2 * Albert's height = 2 * 36 inches = 72 inches.

2. **Calculate Jackie's current height:**
   - Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Her current height is 2 inches less than Anne's height (since she is shorter than Anne).
   - So, Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 3 inches = 72 inches - 3 inches = 69 inches.

3. **Find out how much Jackie has grown in the past:**
   - We know Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height of 69 inches.
   - Thus, Jackie had been growing for some time prior to the summer when she reached her current height of 69 inches.

4. **Work backwards from the summer to find her initial height:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of months Jackie grew since reaching 69 inches.
   - Since she grows at a constant rate per month, we can express her growth as \( 3x \) inches.
   - Initially, her height was \( y \) inches.
   - When she was \( x \) months old, her height was \( y + 3x \).

5. **Use the information about Anne’s height to set up an equation:**
   - We already know that Anne's height is 72 inches.
   - At any point in time, if we denote the number of months ago when she was taller than Jackie, then \( y \) would have been \( y = 72 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We need to find \( x \), but first, we need to understand that \( y \) must also satisfy the condition that it is greater than 69 inches because she started growing from 69 inches.
   - From Anne's height, we know that \( y > 69 \).
   - Therefore, \( y = 72 \).

7. **Substitute back to find \( x \):**
   - Now substitute \( y = 72 \) into the expression \( y = 72 \).
   - This gives us \( 72 = 69 + 3x \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     3x = 72 - 69 \\
     3x = 3 \\
     x = 1
     \]

8. **Calculate Jackie's initial height:**
   - Since Jackie grew 3 inches over 1 month to reach her current height of 69 inches, her initial height before the summer was:
     \[
     \text{Initial Height} = 69 - 3 = 66 \text{ inches}
     \]

**Final Answer:** Jackie was 66 inches tall before the summer.<|im_end|>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall
Anne is 72"" tall and Jackie is 2"" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72-2 = <<72-2=70>>70"" tall
Jackie is currently 70"" tall and grew 3"" over summer, so before summer she was 70-3= <<70-3=67>>67"" tall

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of days in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in those two weeks.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced chocolate bars.

### Step 1: Number of Days in Two Weeks
- There are 7 days in one week.
- Therefore, in two weeks, there are \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) days.

### Step 2: Total Number of Chocolate Bars Produced
- The company produces 5000 bars per day.
- Over 14 days, the total production would be \( 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} \).

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total production} &= 5000 \times 14 \\
&= 70,000 \text{ bars}

### Step 3: Total Revenue from Selling All Bars
- Each bar is sold for $2.
- With 70,000 bars being sold at $2 each, the total revenue would be:
\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total revenue} &= 70,000 \text{ bars} \times \$2/\text{bar} \\

To determine the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost for both the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the cost of the T-shirts:**
   - Jake buys two T-shirts.
   - Each T-shirt originally costs $8.
   - With the ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal, the first T-shirt costs full price ($8), but the second T-shirt gets half off.
   - Cost of the first T-shirt = $8.
   - Cost of the second T-shirt (half off) = $8 / 2 = $4.
   - Total cost for T-shirts = $8 + $4 = $12.

2. **Calculate the cost of the shoes:**
   - The original price of the shoes is $40.
   - With the 40% off deal, the discount is applied directly to the original price.
   - Discounted price of the shoes = $40 * (1 - 0.40) = $40 * 0.60 = $24.
   - Total cost for the shoes = $24.

3. **Sum up the costs:**
   - Total spent on T-shirts = $12.
   - Total spent on shoes = $24.
   - Total amount spent = $12 + $24 = $36.

### Final Answer:
The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \boxed{36}.<|im_end|>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can afford after buying ice cream, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Ryan spent on ice cream.
2. Subtract this amount from his allowance to find out how much money he has left.
3. Determine how many movie tickets he can purchase with the remaining money.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on ice cream.
Ryan bought ice cream for himself and three friends, so there are four people in total. Each cone costs $1.25.
Total cost of ice cream = Number of people × Cost per cone
= 4 × $1.25
= $5.00

Step 2: Subtract the cost of ice cream from Ryan's allowance.
Ryan's allowance is $6.
Money left after buying ice cream = Allowance - Cost of ice cream
= $6 - $5.00
= $1.00

Step 3: Determine how many movie tickets Ryan can afford.
Each ticket costs $6.50.
Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy = Money left / Cost per ticket
= $1.00 ÷ $6.50
≈ 0.154 (approximately)

Since Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a ticket, he can only buy 0 full movie tickets.

Therefore, the number of movie tickets Ryan can afford is **0**. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 0.<|im_end|>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.

Ryan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.
With the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.

To determine how much Ellen and Lani spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item they purchased separately and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Ellen's Total Spending
- **Leggings**: $100
- **Photo Frame**: $5

Ellen’s total spending = $100 + $5 = $105

### Step 2: Calculate Lani's Total Spending
- **Sunglasses**: $30
- **Bathrobes**: Each robe costs $100, so two robes cost 2 * $100 = $200

Lani’s total spending = $30 + $200 = $230

### Step 3: Sum Both Totals
Total amount spent by both Ellen and Lani = Ellen's total + Lani's total
= $105 + $230 = $335

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of ingredients, determine the revenue from selling the jars, and then find the profit.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar
- **Passion Fruit**: 
  - Cost per pound = $6
  - Quantity needed = 2 pounds
  - Total cost = \( 2 \times \$6 = \$12 \)

- **Jackfruit**:
  - Cost per pound = $8
  - Quantity needed = 1.5 pounds
  - Total cost = \( 1.5 \times \$8 = \$12 \)

- **Honey**:
  - Cost per pound = $10
  - Quantity needed = 2 pounds (since 2 pounds of honey are required for 1 jar)
  - Total cost = \( 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \)

- **Total Ingredient Cost**:
  - Total ingredient cost = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

### Step 2: Determine the revenue from selling one jar
- Selling price per jar = $50
- Revenue from one jar = $50

### Step 3: Calculate the profit from one jar
- Profit per jar = Selling price - Ingredient cost
- Profit per jar = $50 - $44 = $6

### Step 4: Calculate the total profit for 10 jars
- Total profit for 10 jars = Profit per jar × Number of jars
- Total profit for 10 jars = $6 × 10 = $60

### Conclusion
Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} $60.<|im_end|>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12

<|im_start|>wait
To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - There are 32 quarters.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8
   \]
   So, the value of the quarters is $8.

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - There are 95 dimes.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.5
   \]
   So, the value of the dimes is $9.50.

3. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - There are 120 nickels.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6
   \]
   So, the value of the nickels is $6.00.

4. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - There are 750 pennies.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.5
   \]
   So, the value of the pennies is $7.50.

5. **Sum up all the values:**
   \[
   8 + 9.5 + 6 + 7.5 = 29
   \]

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is $\boxed{29}$.<|im_end|>","There are 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dollars in quarters.

   - Bracelet: $8.50

2. **Sum up all expenses**:
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \$3.50 + \$15.00 + \$8.50 = \$27.00
   \]

3. **Subtract total expenses from the amount given by her parents**:
   \[

To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days Josh works in one week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Josh is not open on Sunday (1 day) and Wednesday (1 day).
   - Therefore, the number of working days in one week = \( 7 - 1 - 1 = 5 \) days.

2. **Determine the total number of cars serviced in one week:**
   - Josh services 3 cars per day.
   - Number of cars serviced in one week = \( 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \).

3. **Calculate the total amount Josh earns in one week:**
   - Josh earns $4 for each car serviced.
   - Total earnings in one week = \( 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60 \text{ per week} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount Josh earns in two weeks:**

1. **Initial Cookies:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Early Day Snack (Randy eats 3 cookies):**
   - First, Randy eats 1 cookie from each flavor.
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
     - Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
     - Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

3. **Lunch:**
   - Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies.
     - Oatmeal cookies remaining: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

4. **Giving Cookies to Friends:**
   - Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
     - Sugar cookies remaining: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

5. **Baking Dinner Cookies:**
   - Randy bakes 4 oatmeal cookies.
     - Oatmeal cookies after baking: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
   - Randy bakes 4 chocolate chip cookies.
     - Chocolate chip cookies after baking: \(4 + 4 = 8\)
   - Randy bakes 4 sugar cookies.
     - Sugar cookies after baking: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

6. **Final Count:**
   - Oatmeal cookies: 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 8
   - Sugar cookies: 6

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Matthew would earn if he sells his entire collection at the given prices.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total value of the collection:**
   - Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers.
   - The value of one toy soldier can be considered as $1 (since it's not specified otherwise).

   Therefore, the total value of the collection is:
   \[
   12 \text{ toys} \times \$1/\text{toy} = \$12
   \]

2. **Calculate the selling price based on the buyer’s offer:**
   - The buyer offers to pay different amounts for the two halves of the collection:
     - Half the collection at $5 per toy.
     - The other half at $7 per toy.

3. **Sum up the sales from both halves:**
   - For the first half ($5 per toy):
     \[
     \left(\frac{12}{2}\right) \times \$5 = 6 \times \$5 = \$30
     \]
   - For the second half ($7 per toy):
     \[
     \left(\frac{12}{2}\right) \times \$7 = 6 \times \$7 = \$42
     \]

4. **Total earnings from selling both halves:**
   \[
   \$30 + \$42 = \$72
   \]

Therefore, Matthew would earn a total of $\boxed{72}$ dollars if he agrees to the offer.<|im_end|>","Half of Matthew collection means 12 * 0.5 = <<12*0.5=6>>6 toy soldiers.
A buyer wants to buy 6 toy soldiers for $5, so he would pay 6 * 5 = $<<6*5=30>>30 for them.
And for the other half, he wants to pay $7 per toy, which would sum up to 6 * 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.
So if Matthew would agree to the buyer's offer, he would earn 30 + 42 = $<<30+42=72>>72.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Nate's dog can dig 6 holes per day.
2. Nate works for 14 days during his absence.
3. When Nate returns, he fills in 9 holes per day.
4. The dog continues to dig 6 holes per night.

First, calculate how many holes Nate would have dug before his return:

- Nate digs at a rate of 6 holes/day.
- He works for 14 days.
- Total holes dug = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Next, calculate how many holes the dog digs over 14 days:

- Dog digs at a rate of 6 holes/day.
- It digs for 14 days.
- Total holes dug by dog = 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

Now, we know that both Nate and the dog will continue digging after Nate returns until all holes are filled.

Let \( x \) be the number of additional days after Nate returns when he stops digging.

During these \( x \) days, Nate will continue to fill in holes at a rate of 9 holes/day. 

Also, the dog will keep digging at its current rate of 6 holes/day.

Since Nate and the dog together fill in 9 holes per day, they together can fill \( (x + 1) \) days worth of holes per day (since Nate adds an extra hole).

So, the total number of holes filled in \( x \) days should equal the total number of holes dug by both Nate and the dog combined:

\[ 9(x + 1) = 84 + 84 \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):

\[ 9x + 9 = 168 \]
\[ 9x = 159 \]
\[ x = \frac{159}{9} \]
\[ x = 17.67 \text{ days} \]

This means it takes approximately 17.67 days for Nate to finish digging all the holes left unfilled.

Finally, convert this time into weeks:

\[ 17.67 \text{ days} / 7 \approx 2.52 \text{ weeks} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to compare the average enrollments at two high schools: Norman High School and Butler High School.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students enrolled at Butler High School.
Given that Butler High School enrolls \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Enrollment at Norman High} \]

We know that the average enrollment at Norman High School is 4000 students per year. Therefore,

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication.

\[ \text{Enrollment at Butler High} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has an average enrollment of 3000 students.

Step 3: Determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School.

To find out how much greater Norman's enrollment is relative to Butler’s, we subtract the enrollment at Butler from the enrollment at Norman:

\[ \text{Difference in Enrollment} = \text{Enrollment at Norman} - \text{Enrollment at Butler} \]

Substitute the values we found:

\[ \text{Difference in Enrollment} = 4000 - 3000 \]

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.

\[ \text{Difference in Enrollment} = 1000 \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 more students than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Final Answer: The final answer is: **1000**.<|im_end|>","If Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year, Butler High School school enrolls an average of 3/4*4000 =<<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 students every year.

2. **Determine the number of non-chocolate chip cookie types**:
   - They have made 2595 rainbow cookies.
   - They have made 3075 oatmeal cookies.

3. **Calculate the combined number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies**:
   \[
   2595 \text{ (rainbow cookies)} + 3075 \text{ (oatmeal cookies)} = 5670 \text{ cookies}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and systematically work through it:

1. **Dr. Grumpus' Request:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Igor's Gathering:**
   - Test tubes: Half as many as requested (16 / 2 = 8)
   - Beakers: Correctly gathered (7)
   - Petri dishes: Two more than requested (14 + 2 = 16)

3. **Total Items Gathered:**
   - Test tubes: 8
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 16

4. **Items Lost or Missing:**
   - Since Igor gathered less than requested in some categories but not others, we need to determine how many items were lost.

5. **Total Items at Lab Bench:**
   The total number of items on the lab bench is given as 29.

Let's set up an equation to represent the situation:

\[ \text{Test Tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri Dishes} = \text{Total Items} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ 8 \text{(test tubes)} + 7 \text{(beakers)} + x \text{(petri dishes)} = 29 \]

Where \(x\) represents the number of missing petri dishes.

Solve for \(x\):

\[ 8 + 7 + x = 29 \]
\[ 15 + x = 29 \]
\[ x = 29 - 15 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, Igor had 14 additional items that were not accounted for.

Since Igor had gathered fewer items than required in other categories, the only logical conclusion is that he lost some items during the transfer from where he gathered them to the lab bench.

Therefore, Igor lost 14 beakers.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 14. Igor lost 14 beakers.<|im_end|>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of legs needed:**
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs needed = \( 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Calculate the total number of screws required:**
   - Each leg requires 2 screws.
   - There are 16 legs in total.
   - Therefore, the total number of screws required = \( 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \).

3. **Subtract the number of screws used from the total number of screws available:**
   - James initially has 40 screws.
   - He uses 32 screws to assemble the tables.
   - The number of screws left over = \( 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \).

Therefore, after assembling the tables, James will have 8 screws left over.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 8 screws.<|im_end|>","Each table will take 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 screws

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of eggs in the first basket.
2. Calculate the number of eggs in the second basket based on the information given.
3. Add the number of eggs from both baskets.

Let's go through each step:

Step 1: There are 10 eggs in the first basket.

Step 2: According to the problem, there are twice as many eggs in the second basket. Therefore, we can calculate the number of eggs in the second basket by multiplying the number of eggs in the first basket by 2.

Number of eggs in the second basket = 10 (from Step 1) * 2 = 20

Step 3: To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the number of eggs from the first basket to the number of eggs from the second basket.

Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket
= 10 + 20 = 30

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets put together is 30.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each girl raised and then sum their contributions.

1. **Determine how much Kim raised:**
   - We know that Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra.
   - Alexandra raised $430.
   - Therefore, Kim's contribution is \( 430 + 320 = 750 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate how much Maryam raised:**
   - Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah.
   - Sarah raised $300.
   - Therefore, Maryam's contribution is \( 300 + 400 = 700 \) dollars.

Now, let's summarize the amounts raised by each girl:

- Kim raised $750.
- Alexandra raised $430.
- Maryam raised $700.
- Sarah raised $300.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount raised by adding these contributions together:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race given that she ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Aaron's speed relative to Vanessa:**
   - Let \( V \) represent the time taken for Vanessa to run one mile.
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, he can cover a distance in half the time. Therefore, if \( A \) represents the time taken for Aaron to run one mile, then \( A = \frac{V}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the total time for both runners:**
   - The total time for the race is given as 16 minutes (for Aaron).
   - Let \( T \) be the total time for the race.
   - Therefore, \( T = 16 \) minutes.

3. **Express the relationship between their speeds and distances:**
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, the ratio of their times should reflect the inverse of their speeds.
   - Given \( A = \frac{V}{2} \), we have \( A + V = T \).

4. **Substitute and simplify:**
   - Substitute \( A \) from the previous step into the equation \( A + V = T \):
     \[
     \frac{V}{2} + V = 16
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{V}{2} + \frac{2V}{2} = 16
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3V}{2} = 16
     \]

5. **Solve for \( V \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     3V = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     V = \frac{32}{3}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     V = \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Vanessa took approximately \( 10.67 \) minutes to complete her part of the race.<|im_end|>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much more line is needed:**
   - The caretaker already has 6 feet of line.
   - Each foot of line covers 3 feet of dock.
   
   To find out how much more line is needed per foot of dock, we divide the number of feet of line per foot of dock by the amount of dock covered per foot of line.

\[
\text{Additional line needed per foot of dock} = \frac{\text{Line per foot of dock}}{\text{Dock per foot of line}} = \frac{3}{1} = 3 \text{ feet}
\]

2. **Calculate the total additional line needed:**
   - There are 200 feet of dock available.
   - So, the total additional line needed is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total additional line needed} = \text{Dock length} \times \text{Additional line needed per foot of dock} = 200 \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet}
\]

3. **Add the current line to the required line:**
   - The caretaker currently has 6 feet of line.
   - Therefore, the total line needed after buying is:

\[
\text{Total line needed} = \text{Current line} + \text{Total additional line needed} = 6 + 600 = 606 \text{ feet}
\]

### Conclusion:
The caretaker needs to buy 606 feet of line in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 606 feet.<|im_end|>","200*3 = <<200*3=600>>600 feet of line.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to break down the costs associated with ordering meals and wine and then calculate the total revenue from reservations.

### Step 1: Calculate daily expenses for meals and wine.
- Each meal costs $5, and there are 2 meals ordered per night.
\[ \text{Cost per night for meals} = 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \]

- The bottle of wine costs $5.
\[ \text{Total nightly expense (meals + wine)} = \$10 + \$5 = \$15 \]

### Step 2: Calculate weekly expenses.
Tom operates for 2 days a week.
\[ \text{Weekly expense} = 2 \times \$15 = \$30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate daily revenue from reservations.
Tom receives 6 reservations every night.
\[ \text{Daily revenue from reservations} = 6 \times \$20 = \$120 \]
(Note: Assuming each reservation typically results in two people dining out)

### Step 4: Calculate weekly revenue from reservations.
Since they operate for 2 days a week:
\[ \text{Weekly revenue from reservations} = 2 \times \$120 = \$240 \]

### Step 5: Calculate net profit.
Subtract the weekly expense from the weekly revenue.
\[ \text{Net profit per week} = \$240 - \$30 = \$210 \]

Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes a net profit of **\$210** per week.<|im_end|>","The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price:**
   - The fruit vendor made a profit of 25% on his purchase.
   - His original cost for 50 watermelons was $80.
   - To find the profit amount, multiply the cost by the profit percentage:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20
     \]
   - Add the profit to the original cost to get the total selling price:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon:**
   - Since he sold all 50 watermelons, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2
     \]

3. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Multiply the selling price per watermelon back by the number of watermelons to ensure it equals the total selling price:
     \[
     2 \times 50 = 100

                    question:
                    John had . a ! son James when he was 19.  James is now twice as old as his . sister Dora, who . will ; turn 12 in 3 years. !  . How ! old will John's youngest son, , who was . born when John was 32, ; be in , 3 years?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of all individuals involved and then use those ages to find out how old John’s youngest son will be in three years.

### Step 1: Determine John's age when he had James.
John was 19 when he had James. Since James is currently twice as old as Dora, and since James will turn 12 in 3 years, we can calculate Dora's current age:

\[ \text{Dora's age} = \frac{\text{James's age}}{2} - 3 \]

Since James will turn 12 in 3 years, he is currently \(12 - 3 = 9\) years old.

So,
\[ \text{Dora's age} = \frac{9}{2} - 3 = 4.5 - 3 = 1.5 \]

Therefore, Dora is currently **1.5 years** old.

### Step 2: Calculate John's current age.
Given that John was 19 when he had James, and James is now 9 years old (twice Dora's current age), we can deduce John's current age:

\[ \text{John's age} = 19 + 9 = 28 \]

### Step 3: Determine the ages of James and Dora in three years.
In three years, James will be:
\[ 9 + 3 = 12 \]

And Dora will be:
\[ 1.5 + 3 = 4.5 \]

### Step 4: Calculate John's youngest son's age in three years.
If John's youngest son, let's call him John Jr., was born when John was 32, then John Jr. is currently:
\[ 32 - 3 = 29 \]

After three years, John Jr. will be:
\[ 29 + 3 = 32 \]

However, since John Jr. has been alive for two years (since his birth), we need to subtract one year from his calculated age:
\[ 32 - 2 = 30 \]

Thus, in three years, John Jr. will be **30 years** old.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges:**
   - We need information about the total number of oranges in the basket.
   - However, this information is missing from the given details.

2. **Calculate the rate at which Ana and Jane can peel oranges:**
   - Ana peels oranges at a rate of 3 oranges per minute.
   - Jane peels oranges at a rate of 4 oranges per minute.

3. **Calculate the time they spend peeling oranges within one hour (60 minutes):**
   - Ana peels for \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) minutes.
   - Jane peels for \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) minutes.

4. **Calculate the number of oranges each has peeled based on their rates and the time spent:**
   - Ana peels \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) oranges.
   - Jane peels \( 4 \times 15 = 60 \) oranges.

5. **Compare the number of oranges peeled by both:**
   - Both Ana and Jane have peeled the same number of oranges, which is 60.

Therefore, there are no more oranges that Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is} 0 oranges.<|im_end|>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the reduced price of the radiator:**
   - The original price of the radiator is $400.
   - He gets it at a 80% discount.
   - Discount amount = 80% of $400 = \(0.8 \times 400 = 320\).
   - Reduced price = Original price - Discount amount = $400 - $320 = $80.

2. **Calculate the labor costs for installing the radiator:**
   - It takes 3 hours of work at $50 per hour.
   - Labor cost = Number of hours × Hourly rate = 3 hours × $50/hour = $150.

3. **Add both amounts together to find the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the radiator + Labor cost = $80 + $150 = $230.

Therefore, Mark paid a total of $230 for the radiator installation.<|im_end|>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80

": Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?","<|im_start|>system

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    : Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that there are 20 animals in total, so we can write:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows also have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is given as 70, so we can write:
     \[
     2c + 4k = 70
     \]

3. **Solve for One Variable in Terms of the Other:**
   - From the first equation, we can express \( k \) in terms of \( c \):
     \[
     k = 20 - c
     \]

4. **Substitute This Expression into the Second Equation:**
   - Substitute \( k = 20 - c \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
     \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( c \):**
   - Distribute the 4 inside the parentheses:
     \[
     2c + 80 - 4c = 70
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     -2c + 80 = 70
     \]
   - Subtract 80 from both sides:
     \[
     -2c = -10
     \]
   - Divide by -2:
     \[
     c = 5
     \]

6. **Find the Number of Cows Using the Value of \( c \):**
   - Substitute \( c = 5 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( k \):
     \[
     k = 20 - 5 = 15
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4k = 2(5) + 4(15) = 10 + 60 = 70
     \]
   - Verify the total number of animals:
     \[
     c + k = 5 + 15 = 20
     \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of people:**
   - Henry orders 7 pizzas.
   - He has 3 friends who also ordered pizzas.

2. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - Including Henry, that makes \( 4 \) people (Henry + 3 friends).

3. **Find out how many slices per pizza there are:**
   - Each pizza is cut into \( 8 \) slices.

4. **Calculate the total number of slices available:**
   - Since there are \( 7 \) pizzas and each pizza has \( 8 \) slices, the total number of slices is:
     \[
     7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 56 \text{ slices}
     \]

5. **Divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:**
   - To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:
     \[
     \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices/person}
     \]

Therefore, each person can have \( 14 \) slices of pizza.
