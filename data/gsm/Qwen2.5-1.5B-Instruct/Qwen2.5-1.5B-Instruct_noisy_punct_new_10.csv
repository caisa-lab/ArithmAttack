Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how much money Janet makes from selling her duck eggs.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
Janet has 3 ducks that lay 16 eggs per day. Therefore,
\[ \text{Total eggs per day} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet uses.
- **Eggs eaten for breakfast:** Each of the 3 ducks lays 16 eggs per day, so 3 ducks * 16 eggs/duck = 48 eggs/day (since all eggs are used for breakfast).
- **Eggs used to bake muffins:** She bakes muffins using 4 eggs per day.

So, the total number of eggs used is:
\[ \text{Total eggs used per day} = 48 (\text{for breakfast}) + 4 (\text{to bake muffins}) = 52 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining eggs after usage.
Subtract the eggs used from the total eggs laid per day:
\[ \text{Remaining eggs per day} = 48 - 52 = -4 \]
Since it can't be negative, this indicates an error in the calculation or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

It seems there might be an inconsistency because the total eggs laid cannot exceed the eggs used. Let's correct our approach:

Given that Janet only needs 4 eggs to bake muffins, let's assume she only bakes muffins when she has enough eggs left over. Since she only needs 4 eggs for baking, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly.

### Step 4: Recalculate based on correct understanding.
Assuming she only bakes muffins when she has more than 0 eggs left over:
\[ \text{Remaining eggs per day} = 48 - 4 = 44 \]

Now, let's calculate how much money she makes from selling these eggs.

### Step 5: Calculate the revenue.
She sells the remaining eggs for $2 per egg.
\[ \text{Revenue per day} = 44 \times 2 = \$88 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ \boxed{\$88} \]<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts required for making a robe based on the given information.

Step 1: Determine the amount of blue fiber needed.
- The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber needed.
- The problem states that the robe needs ""half as much"" white fiber as there is blue fiber.
- Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that would be \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Step 3: Sum up both types of fibers.
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt
- Total number of bolts: \( 2 + 1 = 3 \)

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment**
Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs.
Total initial investment = $80,000 (house purchase) + $50,000 (repairs)
= $130,000

**Step 2: Determine the increase in property value due to renovations**
The value of the house increased by 150% after the repairs were made.

**Step 3: Calculate the new value of the house after the increase**
New value = Initial value × (1 + percentage increase)
= $130,000 × (1 + 1.5)
= $130,000 × 2.5
= $325,000

**Step 4: Calculate the profit**
Profit = New value - Total initial investment
= $325,000 - $130,000
= $195,000

Therefore, the profit Josh made from the house flip is **$195,000**.<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance James runs in one session:**
   - James runs 3 sprints.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.

\[
\text{Distance per session} = \text{Number of sprints} \times \text{Length of each sprint}
\]

\[
\text{Distance per session} = 3 \times 60 \text{ meters}
\]

\[
\text{Distance per session} = 180 \text{ meters}
\]

2. **Determine how many sessions James has in a week:**
   - James runs 3 sessions a week.

\[
\text{Total number of sessions per week} = 3 \times 3
\]

\[
\text{Total number of sessions per week} = 9
\]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:**
   - Multiply the distance per session by the total number of sessions per week.

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \text{Distance per session} \times \text{Total number of sessions per week}
\]

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = 180 \text{ meters} \times 9

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much feed is needed for the final meal given that the total amount of feed distributed over all days is already known.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed provided daily.
- Each chicken gets 3! cups of feed per day.
- There are 20 chickens.
- Therefore, the total amount of feed per day = \(20 \times 3! = 60\) cups.

Step 2: Determine the total amount of feed used in the mornings.
- Morning feed: 15 cups for 20 chickens.
- This means the remaining feed after the morning is used for the afternoon and final meals.

Step 3: Subtract the morning feed from the total daily feed to find out how much feed is left for the afternoon and final meals.
- Remaining feed for the afternoon and final meals = Total daily feed - Morning feed = \(60 - 15 = 45\) cups.

Step 4: Determine how much feed is required for the final meal.
- The final meal consists of two parts: the afternoon meal and the remaining feed after the afternoon meal.
- We know the afternoon meal is 25 cups (as mentioned in the problem).
- Let the amount of feed needed for the final meal be \(x\).

Since the total feed for the final meal is the same as the remaining feed after the morning meal, which is 45 cups, and it includes the afternoon meal plus whatever is left after the afternoon meal:

\[ x + 25 = 45 \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = 45 - 25 = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of feed needed for the final meal is **20 cups**.<|im_end|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many glasses will cost full price.
2. Determine how many glasses will cost discounted price.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of full-price glasses and discounted glasses.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many glasses will cost full price
Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses in total. We assume that he buys at least one glass at full price (i.e., $5) to cover the basic requirements or as an option if needed. Let's say he buys x glasses at full price where \(x\) is between 1 and 16 inclusive.

### Step 2: Determine how many glasses will cost discounted price
Since every second glass costs only 60% of the price, half of the glasses will be at discount. Therefore, the number of discounted glasses will be \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\).

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
- Cost of full-price glasses: \(x \times \$5\)
- Cost of discounted glasses: \(8 \times \$5 \times 0.6\) (since they are 60% of the original price)

Now let's calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (\text{Cost of full-price glasses}) + (\text{Cost of discounted glasses}) \]

We can use different values for \(x\) from 1 to 16 to find out the minimum and maximum possible costs. However, since we don't have specific values for \(x\), we'll express it in terms of \(x\):

If Kylar buys all glasses at full price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = x \times \$5 \]

If Kylar buys 1 glass at full price and the rest at discount:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1 \times \$5 + 8 \times \$5 \times 0.6 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 \times 0.6 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$5 \times 4.8 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$5 + \$24 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$29 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$29} \]<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the problem, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Number of sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Since Charleston has 80 sheep, we calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

4. **Sum the total number of sheep for all three cities:**
   - Now we add the number of sheep from Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle:
     \[
     \text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} + \text{Number of sheep in Seattle}
     \]
     Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total number of sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is \(260\).<|im_end|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To determine how long it will take Carla to complete her download after restarting, we need to break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total time for the full download without interruptions:**
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - Her normal download speed is 2 GB per minute.
   - Time required at normal speed = Total Size / Download Speed
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of data downloaded before the interruption:**
   - At 40% through the download, she had downloaded 80% of the file (since 100% - 40% = 60%, or 3 out of 5 parts).
   - Amount of data downloaded before interruption = 80% of 200 GB
     \[
     \text{Data Downloaded Before Interruption} = 0.8 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 160 \text{ GB}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining data to be downloaded after the interruption:**
   - Remaining Data = Total Data - Data Downloaded Before Interruption
     \[
     \text{Remaining Data} = 200 \text{ GB} - 160 \text{ GB} = 40 \text{ GB}
     \]

4. **Calculate the new download rate after the interruption:**
   - After the interruption, Carla needs to resume downloading at her reduced speed due to the restart.
   - Reduced Speed = Normal Speed * (1 - Percentage Reduced)
     \[
     \text{Reduced Speed} = 2 \text{ GB/min} \times (1 - 0.4) = 2 \text{ GB/min} \times 0.6 = 1.2 \text{ GB/min}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time required to download the remaining data after resuming:**
   - Time Required = Remaining Data / New Download Rate
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{40 \text{ GB}}{1.2 \text{ GB/min}} = \frac{40}{1.2} \text{ minutes} = 33.\overline{3} \text{ minutes}
     \]
   
So, after calculating all these steps, we find that the time required to download the remaining 40 GB at her reduced speed is approximately 33.33 minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken to download the entire file after the interruption is:
\[ 100 \text{ minutes} + 33.\overline{3} \text{ minutes} = 133.\overline{3} \text{ minutes} \]

This means it will take Carla about 133.33 minutes to finish downloading the file after restarting halfway through.<|im_end|>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to break down John's journey into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **First Segment:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John tries to go back home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours stuck in traffic.
     - Time spent in traffic = 2 hours
     - Remaining time available for travel = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours
   - John drives at 30 mph for 2 hours.
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]
   
3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives at 80 mph for the remaining part of the trip (remaining time of 4 hours after accounting for the two hours already used).
     - Remaining time after 2 hours in traffic = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours
     - Distance = Speed × Time
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ miles}
     \]

### Total Distance Covered:

- First segment: 180 miles
- Second segment: 60 miles
- Third segment: 160 miles

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 180 + 60 + 160 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer:
John is 300 miles away from his starting point at the end of those 4 hours. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]<|im_end|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

                    question:
                    Eliza's rate per hour for ; the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives ? an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. ! If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how ; much are her earnings for this week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Eliza's total earnings for working 45 hours in a week, we need to calculate both her regular pay for the first 40 hours and her overtime pay for any additional hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Regular Pay (First 40 Hours):**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - She works for 40 hours.
   - Regular pay = Hourly rate × Number of hours worked
     \[
     \text{Regular pay} = \$10 \times 40 = \$400
     \]

2. **Calculate Overtime Pay (Beyond 40 Hours):**
   - Overtime pay is calculated at 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.
   - Regular hourly rate: $10
   - Overtime pay factor: 1.2
   - Additional hours worked beyond 40 hours: \(45 - 40 = 5\) hours
   - Overtime pay = Overtime pay factor × (Hourly rate × Additional hours)
     \[
     \text{Overtime pay} = 1.2 \times (\$10 \times 5) = 1.2 \times \$50 = \$60
     \]

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \$460
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$460}
\]<|im_end|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of downloads for the second month:**
   - We know that the number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month.
   - First month: 60 downloads.
   - Second month: \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \) downloads.

2. **Calculate the number of downloads for the third month:**
   - In the third month, the number of downloads is 70% (or 0.7 times) of the downloads from the second month.
   - Second month: 180 downloads.
   - Third month: \( 180 \times 0.7 = 126 \) downloads.

3. **Sum up the total downloads over the three months:**
   - First month: 60 downloads.
   - Second month: 180 downloads.
   - Third month: 126 downloads.
   - Total downloads: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \) downloads.

Therefore, the total number of downloads over the three months is {The final answer is} 366.<|im_end|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost Toula spent at the bakery, we need to calculate the cost for each type of pastry separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs
Now, add the costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330 = 794

                    question:
                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will ; grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for , $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to , water and feed the tree. How many years will it : take before ; he starts earning money on the lemon tree?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts making a profit from his lemon tree, we need to consider both the initial cost and the revenue generated over time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Cost:**
   - The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
   
2. **Revenue per Lemon:**
   - Carlos sells each lemon for $1.50.
   
3. **Cost per Year:**
   - Watering and feeding the tree costs $3 annually.
   
4. **Annual Revenue Calculation:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of years until Carlos makes a profit.
   - In one year, he will produce \( 7n \) lemons (since he gets 7 lemons per year).
   - Selling these lemons at $1.50 each gives him an annual revenue of \( 7n \times \$1.50 = 10.5n \).

5. **Net Profit per Year:**
   - Net profit per year = Annual Revenue - Annual Cost
   - Therefore, net profit per year = \( 10.5n - 3 \).

6. **Break-Even Point:**
   - To break even, the total net profit must equal the initial investment ($90).
   - Set up the equation where the total net profit equals $90:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} [10.5i - 3] = 90
     \]

7. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Calculate the sum of the series:
     \[
     10.5 + 21 + 31.5 + ... + 10.5n - 3n = 90
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     10.5(n - 1) + 21 + 31.5 + ... + 10.5n = 90
     \]
   - Notice that this is an arithmetic series starting from 10.5 and increasing by 1.5 each term.

8. **Sum of Arithmetic Series:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2a + (n-1)d]
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 10.5 \), \( d = 1.5 \), and \( S_n = 90 \):
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [2(10.5) + (n-1)(1.5)]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [21 + 1.5n - 1.5]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [21 + 1.5n - 1.5]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [21 + 1.5n - 1.5]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [19.5 + 1.5n]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [19.5 + 1.5n]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [19.5 + 1.5n]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [19.5 + 1.5n]
     \]
     \[
     90 = \frac{n}{2} [19.5 + 1.5n]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

2. **Calculate Sales at Each House:**
   - At the green house, she sold a third of her total.
     \[
     \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at green house} = \frac{x}{3}
     \]
   - At the red house, she sold 2 more than what she sold at the green house.
     \[
     \text{Vacuum cleaners sold at red house} = \left(\frac{x}{3}\right) + 2
     \]
   - At the orange house, she sold half of what was left after selling at the other houses.
     \[
     \text{Vacuum cleaners remaining at orange house} = \left(\frac{x}{3} + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right)\right) / 2 = \left(\frac{2x}{3} + 2\right) / 2 = \left(x/3 + 1\right)
     \]

3. **Set Up Equation Based on Remaining Vacuum Cleaners:**
   According to the problem, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left at the orange house.
   \[
   \left(\frac{2x}{3} + 2\right) / 2 = 5
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Simplify the equation from step 3:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{2x}{3} + 2}{2} = 5
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} + 2 = 10
   \]
   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 8
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3:
   \[
   2x = 24
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

So, Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - Total students = 20
   - Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20 \times \frac{20}{100} = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after contemporary dance enrollment:**
   - Remaining students = Total students - Students in contemporary dance
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students:**
   - Percentage enrolled in jazz dance = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 16 \times \frac{25}{100} = 4
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students remaining after both contemporary and jazz dance enrollments:**
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dances = Remaining students - Students in jazz dance
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 16 - 4 = 12
   \]

Thus, the remaining students must be enrolled in hip-hop dance.

5. **Determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - Percentage enrolled in hip-hop dance = (Students in hip-hop dance / Total students) × 100
   \[
   \text{Percentage enrolled in hip-hop dance} = \left(\frac{12}{20}\right) \times 100 = 60\%

<|im_start|>superior
To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the expected value of both options based on the given growth rates.

### Step 1: Calculate the Value After Growth

#### Jewelry Plan
- Initial value = $5,000
- Growth rate = 2.5%
- Time period (months) = 1

Value after growth can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Future Value} = \text{Initial Value} \times (1 + \text{Growth Rate})^{\text{Time Period}} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{jewelry}} = \$5,000 \times (1 + 0.025)^1 \]
\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{jewelry}} = \$5,000 \times 1.025 \]
\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{jewelry}} = \$5,125 \]

#### Electronic Gadgets Plan
- Initial value = $8,000
- Growth rate = 1.2%
- Time period (months) = 1

Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{gadgets}} = \$8,000 \times (1 + 0.012)^1 \]
\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{gadgets}} = \$8,000 \times 1.012 \]
\[ \text{Future Value}_{\text{gadgets}} = \$8,096 \]

### Step 2: Compare Future Values

Now compare the future values obtained from both plans.

- Jewelry Future Value = $5,125
- Gadgets Future Value = $8,096

Since $8,096 > $5,125, the electronic gadgets have a higher future value.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is The electronic gadgets plan has a higher profit potential of $8,096 compared to the jewelry plan's $5,125. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets plan to maximize his profit.<|im_end|>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance traveled by each train on the first day.

- Each train travels from San Rafael to its destination.
- The first day covers 80 miles.

Since there are two trains (let's call them Train A and Train B), we need to calculate the total distance for both trains combined on the first day.

\[
\text{Total distance on Day 1} = 2 \times 80 \text{ miles} = 160 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance after the first day.

After the first day, each train will continue to travel.

- On the second day, each train travels another 150 miles.

### Step 3: Add the distances together to find the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

For each train, the total distance covered over the two days can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total distance covered by each train} = 160 \text{ miles (Day 1)} + 150 \text{ miles (Day 2)}
\]
\[
= 160 + 150 = 310 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is **310 miles**.<|im_end|>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.
They also covered 150 miles/train * 2 trains = <<150*2=300>>300 miles together on the second day.
The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

                    question:
                    Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week : as a . coach, what's . her annual . salary?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from both jobs separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings from teaching**
- Hourly wage for teaching: $20/hour
- Number of hours worked per week as a teacher: 35 hours
- Weekly earnings from teaching = $20/hour × 35 hours/week = $700/week

**Step 2: Calculate Jill's weekly earnings from being a cheerleader**
- Hourly wage for coaching: $30/hour
- Number of hours worked per week as a cheerleader: 15 hours
- Weekly earnings from coaching = $30/hour × 15 hours/week = $450/week

**Step 3: Calculate Jill's total weekly earnings**
- Total weekly earnings = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
- Total weekly earnings = $700 (from teaching) + $450 (from coaching)
- Total weekly earnings = $1150

**Step 4: Calculate Jill's annual earnings**
- Weeks in a year: 50 weeks
- Annual earnings = Total weekly earnings × Weeks in a year
- Annual earnings = $1150/week × 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is \boxed{57500}.<|im_end|>","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week

Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500

                    question:
                    Claire makes a 3 egg omelet ; every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in ; 4 weeks?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many eggs Claire eats per day.
2. Calculate the total number of eggs she consumes over 4 weeks.
3. Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs Claire eats per day

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. Therefore, she eats 3 eggs per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs she consumes over 4 weeks

First, let's calculate the total number of days in 4 weeks:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Next, multiply the number of eggs per day by the total number of days:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

### Step 3: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens

There are 12 eggs in one dozen. To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Marissa is ; hiking a 12-mile . trail. She , took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next , two miles. : If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the required walking speed for the remaining distance, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time already spent on the hike.
Marissa has already hiked for:
- 1 hour at 4 miles/hour,
- Another 1 hour at 4 miles/hour,
- Two more hours at 4 miles/hour.

Total time already spent = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 hours.

### Step 2: Determine the remaining distance.
The total distance of the trail is 12 miles. Since she has already covered 4 miles, there are still 8 miles left to cover.

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the desired average speed.
Let \( v \) represent the speed in miles per hour that Marissa needs to maintain for the remaining distance. The remaining distance is 8 miles, so the time needed to cover this distance at speed \( v \) will be \( \frac{8}{v} \) hours.

The average speed over the entire trip should be 4 miles per hour. Therefore, the total distance divided by the total time should equal 4 miles per hour.

### Step 4: Write the equation.
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{4 + \frac{8}{v}}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the equation.
First, simplify the denominator:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{4 + \frac{8}{v}}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 4 + \frac{8}{v} \):
\[
4(4 + \frac{8}{v}) = 12
\]
Distribute the 4:
\[
16 + \frac{32}{v} = 12
\]
Subtract 16 from both sides:
\[
\frac{32}{v} = -4
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( v \).
Since the result is negative, it indicates an error in our setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We know:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{12}{4 + \frac{8}{v}} = 4
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{12}{4 + \frac{8}{v}} = 4
\]
Solving for \( v \):
\[
12 = 4(4 + \frac{8}{v})
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
3 = 4 + \frac{8}{v}
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
-1 = \frac{8}{v}
\]
Since this results in a contradiction (\(-1\) cannot equal \(\frac{8}{v}\)), let’s reassess our approach.

Revisiting the original setup:
\[
\text{Desired Average Speed} = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
Given the desired average speed is 4 mph:
\[
4 = \frac{12}{T}
\]
Where \( T \) is the total time:
\[
T = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
So, the time for the last part must also be 3 hours:
\[
\frac{8}{v} = 3
\]
Solve for \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ mph}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: \( \boxed{2.67} \) mph.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of water in the initial mixtures.

- **Orange Drink**:
  - Total volume = 10 liters
  - Fraction of water = \(\frac{2}{3}\)
  - Volume of water in Orange Drink = \(10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters

- **Pineapple Drink**:
  - Total volume = 15 liters
  - Fraction of water = \(\frac{3}{5}\)
  - Volume of water in Pineapple Drink = \(15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9\) liters

So, initially, we have approximately:
- 6.67 liters of water from the Orange Drink.
- 9 liters of water from the Pineapple Drink.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water after adding more orange juice.

After pouring out 1 liter of orange juice, you'll have:
- Remaining Orange Juice = \(10 - 1 = 9\) liters
- The rest will be poured into the pineapple drink (since only the orange juice was poured).

Since the orange juice was poured into the pineapple drink, all of the 9 liters of orange juice becomes part of the new mixture.

### Step 3: Recalculate the amount of water in the mixed drink.

- **New Volume of Orange Drink** = 9 liters (remaining orange juice) + 1 liter (spilled out) = 10 liters
- **Fraction of Water in New Mixture** = \(\frac{2}{3}\)

Let's calculate the volume of water in the new mixture:
\[ \text{Volume of water} = 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

This means that the 1 liter of orange juice spilled did not contribute any additional water because it was already included in the initial calculation.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the remaining 24 liters contain approximately 6.67 liters of water. 

\[
\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the ages of Raymond and Samantha:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 25 years old.

2. **Determine when Raymond had his son:**
   - Raymond has a son who is currently 23 years old.

3. **Calculate the difference in time between when Raymond had his son and now:**
   - The son is currently 23 years old.
   - Raymond is 25 years old.
   - The difference is \( 25 - 23 = 2 \) years.

4. **Verify if this calculation matches the given information about the son’s age:**
   - Since the son is indeed 23 years old, we can confirm that 2 years have passed since Raymond had his son.

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

**Step 1:** Determine how long the candle has been burning.
- The candle starts burning at 1:00 PM and stops at 5:00 PM.
- Time elapsed = 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours.

**Step 2:** Calculate the total melting length over these 4 hours.
- Given that the candle melts 2 cm per hour, we can calculate the total melting length as follows:
  \[
  \text{Total melting} = \text{Melting rate} \times \text{Time}
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \text{Total melting} = 2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm}

**Step 3:** Determine the original length of the candle.
- Let \( L \) represent the original length of the candle in centimeters.

**Step 4:** Calculate the remaining length of the candle after burning.
- After 4 hours, the candle will have melted by 8 cm, so its remaining length will be:
  \[
  \text{Remaining length} = L - 8 \, \text{cm}
  \]

**Step 5:** Determine how much shorter the candle is compared to its original length.
- To find out how much shorter the candle is, subtract the remaining length from the original length:
  \[
  \text{Shorter length} = L - (L - 8)

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the book before any discounts were applied.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Given that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount on the original price, it means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Now, let's solve for \( P \):

1. Divide both sides by 0.75 to isolate \( P \):
   \[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

2. Perform the division:
   \[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26. 

Hence, the final answer is: The final answer is The original price of the book was $26.<|im_end|>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the items other than the pizzas.
First, let's determine the total cost of the items other than the pizzas:

- **Chicken Meal**: $12
- **Milk Packs**: 5 packs at $3 each = 5 * $3 = $15
- **Apples**: 4 apples at $1.50 each = 4 * $1.50 = $6

Now, add these amounts together:
\[ \text{Total cost of non-pizza items} = \$12 + \$15 + \$6 = \$33 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money was spent on pizzas.
Marie paid a total of $50 in all. Subtracting the cost of the items she bought from her total payment gives us the amount spent on pizzas:
\[ \text{Cost of pizzas} = \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes of pizza.
Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, divide the total cost of the pizzas by the price per box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\$17}{\$8.50} \]

Let’s do the division:
\[ \frac{\$17}{\$8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

                    ; Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She ; buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a ! cost of $4.00 per : carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of servings she consumes in 60 days**
Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 30 nights in 60 days (since \(60 \div 2 = 30\)). Therefore, she consumes:
\[ 30 \text{ servings/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 1800 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of cartons needed**
Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 1800 servings, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 120 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons**
Each carton costs $4.00. So, for 120 cartons, the total cost would be:
\[ 120 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$480.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
{The final answer is} \$480.00.<|im_end|>","Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream
If each carton costs $4.00 and she needs 4 containers then it will cost her 4*4 = $<<4*4=16.00>>16.00

                    question:
                    Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His , second stop was 15 miles before ; the end : of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Henry traveled between his first and second stops on his bike trip.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total Distance of the Trip**:
   Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.

2. **Distance Traveled Before First Stop**:
   Henry stopped after traveling 20 miles.

3. **Calculate Remaining Distance After First Stop**:
   Subtract the distance from the start point (20 miles) from the total trip distance (60 miles):
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ miles}
   \]

   So, Henry has 40 miles left to travel after his first stop.

4. **Second Stop Location**:
   The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.

5. **Calculate Distance Between Stops**:
   Since Henry stopped after 20 miles and then again after an additional 15 miles, the distance between these two stops is simply the difference in their positions.
   \[
   15 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 35 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is **35 miles**.<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.
Henry traveled 60 miles - 35 miles = <<60-35=25>>25 miles between his first and second stop.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the boots and then find out how many dollars they cost.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The boots cost more than one pair of high heels.
   - One pair of high heels costs $33.
   - Another pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair.
   - Together, the two high heels cost five dollars less than the boots.

2. **Calculate the cost of the second pair of high heels:**
   - Since the second pair costs twice as much as the first pair,
     \[
     2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total cost of the two high heels combined:**
   - The total cost of both pairs of high heels is:
     \[
     33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   
4. **Set up an equation based on the information provided:**
   - According to the problem, the combined cost of the two high heels ($99) is five dollars less than the boots' total cost.
   - Let \( B \) represent the total cost of the boots.
   - We know:
     \[
     99 = B - 5
     \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     99 + 5 = B
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     B = 104
     \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total cost of the boots is $104. 

\[
\boxed{104}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the individual ages using the given ratio
Given that Darrell's age (let's call it \(D\)) and Allen's age (let's call it \(A\)) are in the ratio of 7:11, we can express their ages as:
\[ D = 7k \]
\[ A = 11k \]

where \(k\) is some constant.

### Step 2: Set up an equation for the sum of their ages
We know their total age together is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substitute the expressions for \(D\) and \(A\):
\[ 7k + 11k = 162 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 18k = 162 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \(k\)
Divide both sides by 18:
\[ k = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ k = 9 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the current ages
Now substitute \(k = 9\) back into the expression for \(A\):
\[ A = 11k \]
\[ A = 11 \times 9 \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's current age is 99 years old.

### Step 5: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now
Add 10 years to his current age:
\[ A_{\text{future}} = A + 10 \]
\[ A_{\text{future}} = 99 + 10 \]
\[ A_{\text{future}} = 109 \]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be **109** years old.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Define variables.
Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).

Step 2: Express the relationship between gold and silver coins.
According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Therefore, we can write this as:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

where \( G \) represents the number of gold coins.

Step 3: Set up an equation based on the total number of coins.
We know that the total number of coins (gold and silver combined) is 110. So we can write:
\[ G + S = 110 \]

Substitute \( G \) from Step 2 into the equation in Step 3:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]

Step 4: Simplify and solve for \( S \).
Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Step 5: Find the number of gold coins using \( G = S + 30 \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has **70** gold coins.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of silver coins Gretchen has

1. **Determine how many jewels Raymond has:**
   - According to the information given, Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Calculate how many jewels Aaron has based on Raymond’s count:**
   - Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, we first find half of Raymond's jewels.
     \[
     \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Then add 5 to that amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money John makes from selling his Lego sets.
John has 13 Lego sets and sells each set for $15.

\[ \text{Total money made} = 13 \times 15 \]

Calculate this first:

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

So, John makes $195 from selling his Lego sets.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money John spends on video games.
John buys 8 video games at $20 each.

\[
\text{Cost of video games} = 8 \times 20
\]

Calculate this next:

\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]

So, John spends $160 on video games.

### Step 3: Determine how much money John has after buying the video games.
John starts with $195 (from selling his Lego sets) and spends $160 on video games.

Subtract the cost of the video games from the initial amount:

\[
\text{Money remaining} = 195 - 160
\]

Perform the subtraction:

\[
195 - 160 = 35
\]

So, John has $35 left after buying the video games.

### Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John has left.
We know that John originally had 13 Lego sets. If he has $35 left after spending some on video games, we need to determine how many he can afford based on his current budget.

Given that each Lego set costs him $15, we calculate how many sets he can buy with his remaining $35:

\[
\text{Number of sets bought} = \frac{35}{15}
\]

Since he cannot buy a fraction of a set, he will be able to buy only whole sets.

Now, let’s perform the division:

\[
35 \div 15 = 2.333...
\]

This means John can buy 2 full sets because he cannot afford a third set with his remaining funds.

Thus, John has 2 more Lego sets left.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{John has 2 Lego sets left}}<|im_end|>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160

                    question:
                    . John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  ? How fast does he ! run?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate his average speed over the course of one week. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate total distance covered in a week:**
   - John runs 60 miles per week.

2. **Determine the number of days John runs each week:**
   - John runs on 3 different days a week.

3. **Calculate the time spent running each day:**
   - On the first day, John runs for 3 hours.
   - For the remaining two days, he runs half as long as the first day (since he runs 3 hours on the first day).

4. **Calculate the time spent running on the second and third days:**
   - The second day: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours
   - The third day: \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours

5. **Sum up the total time spent running in a week:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   - Total time: \( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

6. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Average speed = \( \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \)

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.<|im_end|>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.
He runs half of those so he runs 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 days.
So for two days, he runs 3/2=<<3/2=1.5>>1.5 hours.
So in total, he runs 3+1.5+1.5=<<3+1.5+1.5=6>>6 hours.
So he runs 60/6=<<60/6=10>>10 mph.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Dana can run ? at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 , miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours ; if : she spends one-third of . the time running : and two-thirds of the time walking?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine Dana's running speed, her walking speed, and then calculate the distance she travels in six hours based on these speeds.

1. **Determine Dana's Running Speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip (run) at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - The skipping rate is half the running rate.
   - Therefore, the running rate \( v_r \) is twice the skipping rate \( v_s \).
   \[
   v_r = 2 \times v_s
   \]
   Given that \( v_s = 3 \) mph,
   \[
   v_r = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Determine Dana's Walking Speed:**
   - The running rate \( v_r \) is four times the walking rate \( v_w \).
   \[
   v_r = 4 \times v_w
   \]
   Substituting the known value of \( v_r \),
   \[
   6 = 4 \times v_w
   \]
   Solving for \( v_w \),
   \[
   v_w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Distance Traveled:**
   - Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Time spent running \( t_r \) is given by the running rate divided by the total time.
   \[
   t_r = \frac{v_r}{\text{total time}} = \frac{6}{6} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]
   Time spent walking \( t_w \) is three times the time spent running.
   \[
   t_w = 3 \times t_r = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Total time \( T \) is the sum of the time spent running and walking.
   \[
   T = t_r + t_w = 1 + 3 = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Since the total time is 4 hours, we now calculate the distance traveled by multiplying the running rate by the running time or the walking rate by the walking time.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v_r \times t_r = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]
   Or,
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v_w \times t_w = 1.5 \times 3 = 4.5 \text{ miles}
   \]

Since both methods yield different distances, it suggests there might be an error in the initial assumption about the time spent. Let’s re-evaluate the problem considering the correct time allocation:

- If Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, let's denote the total time as \( T \).

Given:
\[ \text{Time spent running } = \frac{T}{3}, \quad \text{Time spent walking } = \frac{2T}{3} \]

Running distance:
\[ D_r = v_r \times \frac{T}{3} = 6 \times \frac{T}{3} = 2T \]

Walking distance:
\[ D_w = v_w \times \frac{2T}{3} = 1.5 \times \frac{2T}{3} = T \]

Total distance:
\[ D_{\text{total}} = D_r + D_w = 2T + T = 3T \]

Given that the total time is 6 hours:
\[ T = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore:
\[ D_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

To determine how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the age of Ben's iPhone.
2. Use the age of Ben's iPhone to find out the age of Brandon's iPhone.

Step 1: Determine the age of Ben's iPhone.

We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. According to the information given, Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Ben's iPhone as follows:
\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

So, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

Step 2: Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone.

According to the problem, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Since we have determined that Ben's iPhone is 2 years old, we can calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone as follows:
\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

**Step 1: Understand the initial conditions**

- The Great Dragon (Perg) can breathe fire at a distance of **1000 feet**.
- Polly can throw the gold javelin **400 feet** away without any magical enhancement.
- When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin **three times farther**, which means she can throw it **3 * 400 = 1200 feet**.

**Step 2: Determine the new range when Polly holds the gemstone**

Since holding the gemstone increases the range of the javelin by a factor of three, the new maximum range becomes:

\[ \text{New Maximum Range} = 1200 \times 3 = 3600 \text{ feet} \]

This new range exceeds the dragon's fire range, so Polly would be able to throw the javelin further than her normal throwing distance.

**Step 3: Calculate the additional distance Polly can throw when holding the gemstone**

If Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin **1200 + 400 = 1600 feet** beyond her usual range.

**Step 4: Find out if Polly can still hit the dragon even if she stands outside the dragon’s flame range**

We know that the dragon's fire reaches up to **1000 feet** from its base. Therefore, the area where Polly can stand safely and still hit the dragon with her thrown javelins must lie outside the dragon's fire range but not more than 1000 feet.

From Step 3, we have determined that Polly can throw the javelin **1600 feet**. This is already greater than the dragon's fire range of **1000 feet**.

Thus, regardless of whether Polly stands inside or outside the dragon's fire range, as long as she stands **outside the dragon's fire range** (i.e., **more than 1000 feet away**), she will still be able to hit the dragon with her thrown javelins.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is yes}}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total number of pies initially prepared**:
   - Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.

2. **Number of pies cut**:
   - Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   - Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces at the end**:
   - After the guests took some pieces, 14 pieces were left.

4. **Pieces taken by the guests**:
   - Subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces taken} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Remaining pieces}

   \[
   \text{Pieces taken} = 40 - 14 = 26

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings in the bag:**
   - We know that a 300g bag contains 5 servings.

2. **Determine the total number of calories in the entire bag:**
   - Since each serving has 250 calories.
   - The total number of servings in the bag = \( \frac{5}{5} = 1 \) (since there are 5 servings in the bag).
   - Therefore, the total number of calories in the bag = \( 1 \times 250 = 250 \) calories.

3. **Calculate the remaining calories after consuming 1800 calories:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - Calories already consumed = 1800.
   - Remaining calories = \( 2000 - 1800 = 200 \).

4. **Determine the maximum number of servings you can consume without exceeding your remaining calorie goal:**
   - Each serving has 250 calories.
   - Maximum servings based on remaining calories = \( \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \) servings.

Since the bag only has 1 serving per 300g, you cannot consume more than one serving from the bag even though it has enough calories for less than one full serving.

**Final Answer:**

You can eat **1 serving** from the bag because it contains exactly 250 calories, which is just enough to reach your remaining 200 calories. You cannot exceed this amount as you would need at least two servings to meet your remaining calorie needs.<|im_end|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of candles Charlie can produce.
Charlie has enough beeswax to make 200 candles (since 1 pound of beeswax yields 10 tapered candles).

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the candles.
Each candle is sold for $2.00, so if Charlie sells 200 candles at that price, his total revenue will be:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 200 \times \$2.00 = \$400.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of materials.
The supply cost for one pound of beeswax is $10.00 per pound. Since Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax to make 10 candles, he needs 20 pounds of beeswax to make 200 candles.

Therefore, the total supply cost will be:
\[ \text{Total Supply Cost} = 20 \times \$10.00 = \$200.00 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total profit.
Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Supply Cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$400.00 - \$200.00 = \$200.00 \]

### Conclusion:
Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Meredith spends writing articles over the three days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday). We'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of articles written each day.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote 5 articles.
  
- **Tuesday**:
  - She wrote \( \frac{3}{5} \) times more articles than Monday.
  - Number of articles on Tuesday = \( 5 \times \left(1 + \frac{3}{5}\right) \)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of articles written on Tuesday.

\[
5 \times \left(1 + \frac{3}{5}\right) = 5 \times \left(\frac{8}{5}\right) = 8 \text{ articles}
\]

- **Wednesday**:
  - She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
  - Number of articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times 8 \)

### Step 3: Sum up all articles written from Monday to Wednesday.

- Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday

\[
Total \text{ articles} = 5 + 8 + 16 = 29 \text{ articles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent writing these articles.

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. 

\[
Total \text{ time} = 29 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 116 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is {The final answer is} 116 hours.<|im_end|>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.

Now we need to find out how many post-it notes were originally in the package that she purchased.

Let's denote the number of post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

We know:
\[ x + 23 = 80 \]

This equation represents the total number of post-it notes after purchasing the new package (which contains \( x \) post-it notes). Since she started with 80 post-it notes and ended up with 23 post-it notes, the difference between these two numbers must equal the number of post-it notes in the package.

So,
\[ x - 23 = 220 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 220 + 23 \]
\[ x = 243 \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased was 243. 

{The final answer is} 243<|im_end|>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.

Subtracting 80 from each side of the equation, we see that x=220+23-80=<<220+23-80=163>>163 Post-it notes.

                    question:
                    John buys twice as many red ties : as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than , blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 . each. How much did he spend on ties?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - Let \( b \) represent the number of blue ties.
   - According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the number of red ties is \( 2b \).

2. **Calculate the total amount spent on blue ties:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - If John spends $200 in total on blue ties, then the number of blue ties he bought can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\$200}{\$40} = 5
     \]

3. **Verify the relationship between red and blue ties:**
   - Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, if he has 5 blue ties, he must have \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) red ties.

4. **Calculate the cost per blue tie:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all blue ties:**
   - Total cost for blue ties = Number of blue ties × Cost per blue tie
     \[
     \$200 = 5 \times \$40
     \]
   This confirms our calculations are correct.

6. **Calculate the total cost for all red ties:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Cost of one blue tie = $40.
   - Therefore, the cost of one red tie is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of one red tie} = \$40 + 0.5 \times \$40 = \$40 + \$20 = \$60
     \]
   - Total cost for red ties = Number of red ties × Cost per red tie
     \[
     \text{Total cost for red ties} = 10 \times \$60 = \$600
     \]

7. **Calculate the total amount spent on ties:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties
     \[
     \$200 + \$600 = \$800
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is $\$800$.}<|im_end|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties

So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

   - Therefore, 4 feet = \( 4 \times 12 \) inches = 48 inches.

2. **Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the 48-inch wire:**
   - To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide 48 by 6.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \frac{48}{6} = 8

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of units in the building**

- There are 15 floors.
- Each floor has 8 units.

Total number of units = Number of floors × Units per floor
\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 120 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of units that are occupied**

- The building is 3/4 occupied.
- Therefore, the remaining 1/4 is unoccupied.

Number of occupied units = Total units × Occupancy rate
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 90 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units**

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Unoccupied units} = 30 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced in one week:**
   - We know that Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs produced in one week is \( 252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \).

2. **Convert the price per dozen into per egg:**
   - The selling price is $2 per dozen.
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the price per egg is \( \frac{\$2}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = \$0.1667 \text{ per egg} \) (rounded to four decimal places).

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - With 1764 eggs being sold per week at $0.1667 per egg, the total revenue can be calculated as \( 1764 \text{ eggs/week} \times \$0.1667 \text{ per egg} \).
   - This gives us \( 1764 \times \$0.1667 = \$298.70 \) per week.

Therefore, Lloyd makes $\boxed{298.70}$ per week from selling eggs.<|im_end|>","In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: going from 1 to 4 PM and returning from 4 to some time in the future.

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled from 1 to 4 PM
Tom's ship can travel at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Let's assume he spends an equal amount of time traveling to both places (from 1 to 4 PM).

- Time spent on each trip = \(\frac{3}{2} \text{ hours}\) (since \(4 - 1 = 3\) hours, divided equally between the trips)
- Distance covered in one direction (\(d\)) = Speed × Time
\[ d = 10 \text{ mph} \times \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

So, Tom covers 15 miles in either direction.

### Step 2: Determine the return time
Since Tom returns immediately after completing his first leg of the journey, let's denote the time when he starts his return trip as \(t\) hours past 4 PM.

- Time taken for the return trip = \(\frac{15}{6} \text{ hours}\) (since the return speed is 6 mph)
\[ t = \frac{15}{6} \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

This means Tom will start his return trip 2.5 hours after 4 PM, i.e., at \(6:30 \text{ PM}\).

### Step 3: Calculate total time spent
Total time spent = Time spent going to 4 PM + Time spent returning
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ hours} + 2.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2.5 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Tom **4 hours** to get back home.<|im_end|>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                    question:
                    Uriah's book : bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic : books weigh , 1/4 pound each and his toys , weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys does he need to remove?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the comics after removing 30 comics**

- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
- Removing 30 comics means subtracting \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} \) pounds.

\[ \text{Weight of removed comics} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the remaining weight in the bag after removing the comics is:

\[ \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Initial weight} - \text{Weight of removed comics} \]
\[ \text{Remaining weight} = (15 + 7.5) - 7.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of toy weights needed to reach the remaining weight**

- Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
- Let \( n \) be the number of toys that need to be removed.

We know that the sum of the weights of all the removed items should equal the remaining weight.

\[ \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2} \right) \cdot n = 15 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{n}{2} \cdot n = 15 \]

\[ \frac{n^2}{2} = 15 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[ n^2 = 30 \]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[ n = \sqrt{30} \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up or down based on whether the result is greater than or less than 6.

Given that \( \sqrt{30} \approx 5.48 \), since we can't have a fraction of a toy, we round up to ensure we account for the full weight.

Thus, **\( n = 6 \)**.

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove **6 toys** to bring the weight back within acceptable limits.<|im_end|>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from both days and then determine which day had more revenue.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Day 1: Mechanics Repair Truck Tires Only
1. **Calculate Revenue from Truck Tires:**
   - Number of truck tires repaired = 6
   - Charge per truck tire = $60
   - Total revenue from truck tires = \( 6 \times 60 = \$360 \)

2. **No Car Tires Repaired on Day 1:**
   - No revenue from car tires (since no car tires were repaired).

3. **Total Revenue on Day 1:**
   - Total revenue = $360

#### Day 2: Mechanics Repair Both Truck and Car Tires
1. **Calculate Revenue from Truck Tires:**
   - Number of truck tires repaired = 6
   - Charge per truck tire = $60
   - Total revenue from truck tires = \( 6 \times 60 = \$360 \)

2. **Calculate Revenue from Car Tires:**
   - Number of car tires repaired = 4
   - Charge per car tire = $40
   - Total revenue from car tires = \( 4 \times 40 = \$160 \)

3. **Total Revenue on Day 2:**
   - Total revenue = ($360 + $160) = $520

#### Determine Which Day Had Higher Revenue:
- Revenue on Day 1 = $360
- Revenue on Day 2 = $520

Since $520 > $360, the mechanic earned more revenue on Day 2.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The mechanic earned more revenue on Day 2.<|im_end|>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

   - Their mother informs them that there are just 3 new kittens (since they already have 7).

2. **Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has**:
   - Patchy's kittens are described as having ""thrice"" the number of adopted kittens.
   - Thrice means multiplying by 3: \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) kittens.

3. **Calculate the number of kittens Trixie has**:
   - Trixie has exactly 12 kittens mentioned.

4. **Sum up all the kittens**:
   - Add the original 7 kittens, the 21 kittens Patchy has, and the 12 kittens Trixie has together: 
     \[
     7 + 21 + 12 = 40

                    question:
                    A wooden bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. A delivery . truck filled with identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, will pass over the bridge. The combined ? weight of the driver and ? the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum ! number of boxes which can , be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the : bridge's weight limit?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total weight capacity of the truck:**
   - The truck has an empty weight of 3755 pounds.
   - Each box weighs 15 pounds.
   
2. **Calculate how many boxes can fit in the truck without exceeding its weight limit:**
   - First, calculate the total weight that the truck can carry based on its weight limit of 5000 pounds.
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \frac{\text{Weight limit}}{\text{Weight per box}} = \frac{5000}{15} \approx 333.33 \text{ boxes}
     \]
   
3. **Subtract the empty truck's weight from the total possible load to find out what's left for boxes:**
   - Subtract the empty truck's weight (3755 pounds) from the total weight the truck can carry (333.33 boxes * 15 pounds/box).
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight after loading boxes} = 333.33 \times 15 - 3755
     \]

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - Calculate the total weight available for boxes.
     \[
     333.33 \times 15 = 4999.95 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Subtract the empty truck's weight (3755 pounds):
     \[
     4999.95 - 3755 = 1244.95 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box to determine how many boxes can be loaded:**
   - Divide the remaining weight by the weight of one box (15 pounds).
     \[
     \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1244.95}{15} \approx 82.9967
     \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, the maximum number of whole boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 82.

**Final Answer:** The maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 82.<|im_end|>","The boxes can weigh up to 5000 pounds - 3755 pounds = <<5000-3755=1245>>1245 pounds in total.
There can be 1245 / 15 = <<1245/15=83>>83 boxes loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Bill**: The initial bill before any additional charges or discounts is given as $40.00.

2. **Delivery Fee Calculation**:
   - A 25% fee is added to the initial bill.
   - To calculate the delivery fee, we multiply the initial bill by 25% (or 0.25):
     \[
     \text{Delivery Fee} = \$40.00 \times 0.25 = \$10.00
     \]

3. **Total Before Additional Charges**:
   - Add the delivery fee to the initial bill:
     \[
     \text{Total Before Additional Charges} = \$40.00 + \$10.00 = \$50.00
     \]

4. **Additional Charges**:
   - An additional $3.00 in delivery fees have been added to the total from step 3.
   - This brings the total to:
     \[
     \text{Final Total} = \$50.00 + \$3.00 = \$53.00
     \]

5. **Tip Addition**:
   - A tip of $4.00 has been added after the delivery fees were included.
   - Adding the tip to the final total from step 4 gives us:
     \[
     \text{Final Price of Groceries} = \$53.00 + \$4.00 = \$57.00
     \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all charges and tips is $\boxed{57.00}$.<|im_end|>","He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00

To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the total from the clustered fruits first and then add the scattered fruit.

1. Calculate the total number of fruit in the clustered groups:
   - Each cluster contains 20 fruit.
   - There are 6 clusters.
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruit in clusters} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruit per cluster}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruit in clusters} = 6 \times 20 = 120
   \]

2. Add the scattered fruit:
   - The scattered fruit count is given as 67.
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruit including scattered} = \text{Total fruit in clusters} + \text{Scattered fruit}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total fruit including scattered} = 120 + 67 = 187

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges in the basket are good. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of oranges that are not good.
- There is 1 orange that is bad.
- We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe.

Let \( x \) be the total number of oranges in the basket. Since 20% are unripe, the remaining 80% must be good or bad (but since only one is bad, all other oranges can't be both unripe and bad).

Since there is 1 bad orange, the 20% that are unripe means that \( 0.2x \) are unripe oranges. But since these 20% include both ripe and unripe oranges, they do not overlap because there is only 1 bad orange.

So, the number of unripe oranges is exactly 1 (because if more than one were unripe, there would have to be at least two oranges that aren't bad, but only one is bad).

Thus, the number of unripe oranges = 1.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges in the basket.
We know that the total number of oranges is 25.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges that are not good.
Since we already determined that there is 1 bad orange, the number of oranges that are not good is equal to the total number of oranges minus the number of oranges that are good.

From Step 1, we know there is 1 bad orange, so the number of oranges that are not good is 1.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of oranges that are good.
Now we can find out how many oranges are good by subtracting the number of unripe oranges from the total number of oranges.

\[ \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 1 = 24 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 24 oranges are good.<|im_end|>","20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges
The total number of bad, unripe and sour oranges is therefore 1+5+2 = <<1+5+2=8>>8 oranges
The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much Janet paid in total after insurance, let's break down the costs step-by-step:

1. **Cost of Material**: Janet spends $500 on the material.
2. **Cost of Construction**: She also spends an additional $800 on the jeweler to construct the brooch.

   So far, the total cost before insurance is: 
   \[
   500 + 800 = 1300
   \]

3. **Insurance Cost**: Janet pays 10% of the total construction cost (which is $800) to get the brooch insured.

   To calculate this amount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Insurance Cost} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Amount Paid**: Now, we add up all these amounts to find out how much Janet has spent in total.

   The total amount spent includes:
   - The initial $500 for the material,
   - The $800 for the jeweler,
   - The $80 for insurance.

   Therefore, the total amount paid is:
   \[
   500 + 800 + 80 = 1480

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount earned over 40 years:**
   - Marcy earns an annual pension of $50,000.
   - She works for 40 years.

   \[
   \text{Total Pension Earned} = \$50,000 \times 40 = \$2,000,000
   \]

2. **Determine the annual portion of the pension she receives starting from year 21 onwards:**
   - After working for 20 years, she starts receiving 5% of the value of her pension annually.

   The formula for calculating this annual portion is:
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Portion} = \left( \frac{\$2,000,000}{40} \right) \times 0.05
   \]
   
   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
   
   \[
   \text{Annual Portion} = \$50,000 \times 0.05 = \$2,500
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining pension after 30 years:**
   - Since she worked for 30 years initially, she would have received her full annual portion (which is $2,500) for those 30 years.

   Therefore, the remaining pension balance before the additional 10-year period is not relevant since she stops working at the end of 30 years.

So, after quitting after 30 years, she does not receive any additional annual portions because she has already stopped working entirely.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly subscription cost
Aleena's monthly subscription cost is given as $140.

### Step 2: Determine the number of months in a year
There are 12 months in a year.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of months in the first half of the year
Since the first half of the year consists of 6 months (June to December), we can find out how much Aleena would have paid if there was no discount applied during this period.

\[ \text{Total cost for the first half} = 6 \times \$140 \]

Let’s compute this:
\[
6 \times \$140 = \$840
\]

So, if there were no discounts, Aleena would have paid $840 for the first half of the year.

### Step 4: Apply the 10% discount to the second half of the year
The streaming company offers a 10% discount on the second half of the year. We need to determine the discounted price for the second half of the year.

First, let's find the original price for the entire year without any discounts:
\[
\text{Original total cost for the year} = 12 \times \$140 = \$1680
\]

Now, applying the 10% discount to this amount gives us the reduced cost for the second half of the year:
\[
\text{Discounted price for the second half} = \$1680 \times 90\% = \$1512
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid by the end of the year
Finally, we add the costs from both halves of the year together to get the total amount paid by the end of the year.

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \$840 + \$1512 = \$2352
\]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena has paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $\boxed{\$2352}$.<|im_end|>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,

To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance Sophia has driven so far.
Sophia has already driven 100 miles.

### Step 2: Determine the amount of fuel used per mile.
We know that Sophia filled up the tank after driving 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. Therefore, the number of miles per gallon (mpg) is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Miles per Gallon} = \frac{\text{Total Miles Driven}}{\text{Gallons Used}} \]
\[ \text{Miles per Gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} \]
\[ \text{Miles per Gallon} = 25 \text{ miles/gallon} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of miles Sophia can drive on one full tank.
Since Sophia’s car gets 25 miles per gallon, and her tank holds 12 gallons, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Miles per Gallon} \times \text{Gallons Per Tank} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 25 \text{ miles/gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Calculate how long Jim spends reading.
2. Determine the total time spent on both activities per day.
3. Multiply that daily total by the number of days per week (which is 7) and then multiply by the number of weeks (which is 4).

Let's start with step 1.

**Step 1: Calculate how long Jim spends reading**

Jim spends half as much time reading as he does watching TV. Since he watches TV for 2 hours, he reads for:

\[ \text{Reading time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, Jim spends 1 hour reading each day.

**Step 2: Determine the total time spent on both activities per day**

Now, let's add up the time spent watching TV and reading:

\[ \text{Total time per day} = 2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the weekly total**

Since Jim does this activity 3 times a week, we can calculate his total weekly time spent on these activities:

\[ \text{Weekly total} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total time over 4 weeks**

Finally, we'll find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading over 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Total time over 4 weeks} = 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. **Calculate the number of players:**
   - Each school sends one girl's team and one boy's team.
   - Each team has 5 players.
   - Since there are 4 schools, there will be 2 girls' teams (one from each school) and 2 boys' teams (one from each school).
   - Therefore, the total number of players is calculated as follows:
     \[
     2 \text{ (girls)} + 2 \text{ (boys)} = 4 \text{ players per team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 8 \text{ players}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of coaches:**
   - Each school has sent one coach for each team.
   - There are 2 girls' teams and 2 boys' teams in total.
   - So, the total number of coaches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ (girls)} + 2 \text{ (boys)} = 4 \text{ coaches}
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of people:**
   - The total number of people is the sum of the players and the coaches.
   - Thus, the total number of people is:
     \[
     8 \text{ players} + 4 \text{ coaches} = 12 \text{ people}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]<|im_end|>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.
So each school has sent 2 teams * 5 players per team = <<2*5=10>>10 players.
They have also each sent 2 teams * 1 coach per team = <<2*1=2>>2 coaches.
In total, each school has sent 10 players + 2 coaches = <<10+2=12>>12 people.
Therefore, the schools have sent a total of 12 people per school * 4 schools = <<12*4=48>>48 people.

                    A treasure hunter found ; a buried treasure chest filled with gems. There were ; 175 diamonds, 35 fewer rubies ? than diamonds, and twice the number of emeralds than ? the rubies.   How many of the gems were there in the chest?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of rubies:**
   - The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Number of diamonds = 175
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of rubies.
   - According to the information given, \( R = 175 - 35 \).

2. **Calculate the number of emeralds:**
   - The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies.
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of emeralds.
   - According to the information given, \( E = 2R \).

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Calculate the number of rubies:
\[ R = 175 - 35 \]
\[ R = 140 \]

2. Calculate the number of emeralds:
\[ E = 2 \times 140 \]
\[ E = 280 \]

Now, let's find the total number of gems:
\[ Total\ Gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds \]
\[ Total\ Gems = 175 + 140 + 280 \]
\[ Total\ Gems = 695 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is \(\boxed{695}\).<|im_end|>","There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.
There were 140 x 2 = <<140*2=280>>280 emeralds in the treasure chest.
So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 175 + 140 + 280 = <<175+140+280=595>>595.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know that there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - There are 60 girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys = \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - The total number of students includes both boys and girls.
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
   - Total students = \(120\) (boys) + \(60\) (girls)
   - Total students = \(180\).

3. **Determine the number of teachers based on the given ratio:**
   - The ratio of students to teachers is 5:1.
   - This means for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher.

4. **Calculate the number of teachers:**
   - Since we have 180 students, we can divide this number by 5 to find out how many groups of 5 students there are.
   - Number of teachers = \(\frac{180}{5} = 36\).

Therefore, there are 36 teachers in Dr. Wertz's school.<|im_end|>","There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Allowance Received
Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 over 8 weeks.

Total allowance = Weekly allowance × Number of weeks
                = $5 × 8
                = $40

So, Bailey received a total of $40 in allowances over the 8 weeks.

### Step 2: Determine Initial Amount
At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100.

We know that her total amount after receiving the allowances was $100.

Let \( x \) represent the initial amount of money Bailey started with.

### Step 3: Set Up an Equation
Since Bailey received $40 from allowances, we can write the equation as:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To find out how much money Bailey initially had, we need to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her total earnings from both weekday and weekend classes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of weekday classes**
Judy teaches 5 dance classes daily for 5 days (Monday to Friday).

\[ \text{Number of weekday classes} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of weekend classes**
On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.

\[ \text{Number of weekend classes} = 8 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of classes in a week**
Add the number of weekday classes and weekend classes together:

\[ \text{Total number of classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned from all classes**
Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15 per student. Therefore, the charge per class is:

\[ \text{Charge per class} = 15 \times 15 = \$225 \]

Now, multiply the charge per class by the total number of classes:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 33 \times 225 = \$7425 \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money raised from both brownies and cheesecakes sold. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the revenue from brownies
- Price per brownie = $3
- Number of brownies sold = 43

Revenue from brownies = Price per brownie × Number of brownies sold
\[ \text{Revenue from brownies} = 3 \times 43 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 3 \times 43 = 129 \]

So, Tommy raises $129 from selling brownies.

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from cheesecakes
- Price per cheesecake = $4
- Number of cheesecakes sold = 23

Revenue from cheesecakes = Price per cheesecake × Number of cheesecakes sold
\[ \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 4 \times 23 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 23 = 92 \]

So, Tommy raises $92 from selling cheesecakes.

### Step 3: Add the revenues from both products
Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 \]

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 129 + 92 = 221 \]

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of **$221** from selling both brownies and cheesecakes.<|im_end|>","Tommy raised 43 brownies x $3/brownie = $<<43*3=129>>129 by selling brownies.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost without interest**
- Shiela buys five cell phones at $150 each.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount charged for interest**
- The annual interest rate is 2%, but we need to find out how much interest is charged per month over three months.

First, calculate the monthly interest on the total cost:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{2\%}{12} = \frac{0.02}{12} = 0.001667 \% \]

Now, calculate the total interest over three months:
\[ \text{Interest Over Three Months} = 3 \times \$750 \times 0.001667 \% = 3 \times \$750 \times 0.00001667 \]
\[ \text{Interest Over Three Months} = \$4.99875 \approx \$5 \]

**Step 3: Add the total cost including interest**
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$750 + \$5 = \$755 \]

**Step 4: Divide the total amount paid by the number of months (3)**
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\$755}{3} = \$251.67 \]

Therefore, Shiela will pay approximately **\$251.67 each month for 3 months**.<|im_end|>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of days in the first year**

A year typically consists of 365 days (we'll ignore leap years for simplicity).

\[ \text{Total days} = 365 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of days in the first 180 days**

Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.

\[ \text{Days at 1 cup/day} = 180 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of days remaining after the first 180 days**

Subtract the initial 180 days from the total year:

\[ \text{Remaining days} = 365 - 180 \]

Let's do the subtraction:

\[ 365 - 180 = 185 \]

So, Cecilia will feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food daily for the remaining 185 days.

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of dog food needed during the first 180 days**

Multiply the number of days by the daily intake:

\[ \text{Food for first 180 days} = 180 \times 1 \]

\[ \text{Food for first 180 days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of dog food needed during the remaining 185 days**

Multiply the number of days by the daily intake:

\[ \text{Food for remaining 185 days} = 185 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Food for remaining 185 days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 6: Add both amounts together to get the total food needed**

\[ \text{Total food needed} = 180 + 370 \]

\[ \text{Total food needed} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

**Step 7: Calculate the number of bags required**

Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food. To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total food needed by the capacity of one bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{550}{110} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{550}{110} = 5 \]

**Final Answer:** Cecilia will use **5 bags of dog food** in the first year.<|im_end|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups
The number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 550 / 110 = <<550/110=5>>5 bags

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much laundry Sarah does:**
   - We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Calculate how much laundry David does:**
   - According to the information provided, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
     Therefore, David's amount of laundry = \( \frac{Sarah\ 's\ laundry}{4} \).
   - So, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate how much laundry Raymond does:**
   - It's given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
     Therefore, Raymond's amount of laundry = \( \frac{Sarah\ 's\ laundry}{2} \).
   - So, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

4. **Find the difference between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond and David:**
   - Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry.
   - Difference = 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is **100 pounds**.<|im_end|>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in ! packages of , 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying ? 18 flowers at the better price?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better deal, we need to compare the cost per flower between the two options: buying individual flowers or buying package deals.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per flower when buying individual flowers.
- Vincent buys 18 flowers individually.
- Each package contains 3 flowers.
- Therefore, the number of packages needed = \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) packages.
- Each package costs $2.50.
- Total cost = \( 6 \times 2.50 = \$15 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per flower when buying package deals.
- There are two package deals available:
  - Package A: 3 flowers for $2.50.
  - Package B: 4 flowers for $3.00 (but since it's not possible to buy only 4 flowers without additional charges, let’s assume this was a typo; we’ll use the correct deal as mentioned).
- Package C: 6 flowers for $4.00.
- Since the deal mentions ""one package of two for $1"" but doesn’t specify the quantity, let’s consider the most efficient way to get 18 flowers from one package deal.

Given that Vincent needs 18 flowers, let's see if there's an optimal combination:
- If he uses Package A (3 flowers for $2.50), he would need 6 packages to get 18 flowers.
- This means his total cost would be \( 6 \times 2.50 = \$15 \).

However, let's also check if there’s a cheaper alternative:
- Consider using Package B (4 flowers for $3.00). To get 18 flowers, he would need 4.5 packages, which isn't practical because you can't purchase partial packages.
- So, let's try Package C (6 flowers for $4.00). To get 18 flowers, he would need 3 packages, which fits perfectly into his requirement.

### Step 3: Compare the two methods.
- **Option A** (buying 18 flowers individually): The cost is $15.
- **Option B** (using 3 packages of 6 flowers): The cost is $4.00 * 3 = $12.00.

### Step 4: Determine the savings.
- Savings = Cost of Option A - Cost of Option B
- Savings = $15 - $12.00 = $3.00.

Therefore, Vincent saves $3.00 by choosing the better deal.

The final answer is: The final answer is The savings are $3.00.<|im_end|>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.
The cost of using packages of 3 is 6 × $2.50 = $<<6*2.5=15>>15.
Find how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.
The cost of using packages of 2 is 9 × $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.
Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.

- The initial cost of grooming is $100.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of the discount.
- The discount offered is 30%.

### Step 3: Convert the percentage into a decimal.
- To find 30% as a decimal, divide by 100: 
\[ \frac{30}{100} = 0.3 \]

### Step 4: Multiply the original price by the discount rate to get the discounted price.
- Applying the discount to the original price of $100:
\[ 100 \times 0.3 = 30 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the discount from the original price to get the final cost after applying the discount.
- Subtracting the discount ($30) from the original price ($100):
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

### Final Answer:
The final cost of the grooming after applying the 30% discount is **$70**.<|im_end|>","The groomer gave a 100*.3=$<<100*.3=30>>30 discount

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of water each girl received:**
   - There are two girls.
   - Each girl gets \( \frac{1}{6} \) of 24 liters.
   - Calculate \( \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - Since there are two girls, we multiply by 2:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of water given to the girls:**
   - We already calculated that each girl receives 4 liters.
   - Therefore, the total for both girls combined is:
     \[
     8 \text{ liters (first girl)} + 8 \text{ liters (second girl)} = 16 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Add the amount of water the boy received:**
   - The boy also got 6 liters.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water used:**
   - Add the amounts from the girls and the boy:
     \[
     16 \text{ liters (girls)} + 6 \text{ liters (boy)} = 22 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Subtract the total amount used from the original amount of water:**
   - Start with 24 liters.
   - Subtract the 22 liters used:
     \[
     24 \text{ liters} - 22 \text{ liters} = 2 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, the number of liters of water left is {2}.<|im_end|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Alex's weight:**
   - We know that Alex weighs \(2\) pounds less than \(4\) times what Grace weighs.
   - Grace's weight is \(125\) pounds.

2. **Determine the value of \(4 \times 125\):**
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 125\):
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500

To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. Let's denote the number of losses as L.
2. According to the problem, the number of wins (W) is given as W = L + 8.

Since the total number of games played is 22, we also know that:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Now we substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplify and combine like terms:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, there were 7 losses. Now, using the relationship between wins and losses, we calculate the number of wins:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 15.<|im_end|>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.

So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine how many vacations Gene has been on:**
   - Gene has been on four vacations.

2. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been on these vacations:**
   - Gene started his vacations at age 23.
   - The current year is 34 (Gene's age).
   - Number of years passed = Current year - Start year = 34 - 23 = 11 years.

3. **Determine how many different years of vacations there are for each trip:**
   - Since Gene went on four vacations, and each vacation covers a different year, there must be four different years covered during each vacation.

4. **Calculate the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Each row consists of blocks from a different year.
   - For each vacation, there are \( n \) rows where \( n \) represents the number of different years covered during that vacation.
   - Since Gene has been on four vacations, and each vacation has \( n \) rows per year, the total number of rows is \( 4 \times n \).

5. **Sum up the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Since there are four vacations and each vacation contributes \( n \) rows, the total number of quilt blocks is \( 4n \).

Given that each vacation covers a different year and Gene has been on four vacations, let’s assume \( n = 4 \) (since there are four vacations). Therefore:

- Total number of quilt blocks = \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).

Thus, Gene has a total of 16 quilt blocks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the increase factor.
Sylvie receives an increase of 10% of her initial salary every year.

Let \( S \) be the initial monthly salary.

After one year (after five years), she will have received a 10% increase on her initial salary.

Increase factor = \( 1 + \frac{10}{100} = 1.1 \)

### Step 2: Determine the new salary after the first increase.
After the first increase, her salary becomes:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.1 \]

### Step 3: Apply another 10% increase.
After two years (after six years), she will receive another 10% increase on her new salary.

New increase factor = \( 1 + \frac{10}{100} = 1.1 \)

Salary after second increase:
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.1 \times 1.1 \]
\[ S_{\text{new}} = S \times 1.21 \]

### Step 4: Apply yet another 10% increase.
After three years (after seven years), she will receive another 10% increase on her most recent salary.

New increase factor = \( 1 + \frac{10}{100} = 1.1 \)

Salary after third increase:
\[ S_{\text{final}} = S \times 1.21 \times 1.1 \]
\[ S_{\text{final}} = S \times 1.331 \]

### Step 5: Determine the total number of years Sylvie has been employed.
She has been employed for five years plus three more years.

Total years = 8 years

### Step 6: Calculate the final salary considering the total time spent at the company.
Since she increases her salary annually based on the current year’s salary, the effective annual rate over eight years can be calculated as follows:

Annual increase factor = \( 1.1^{\frac{8}{5}} \)

Calculate this value:
\[ Annual\_increase\_factor = 1.1^1.6 \approx 1.497 \]

This means that after eight years, her salary will effectively double due to the compounded effect of the yearly increases.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be approximately **$600 \times 1.497 = $958**.<|im_end|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
2. Since Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can express Marilyn's sales in terms of \( H \):
   \[
   M = 10H
   \]
3. We know that the total number of copies sold by both is 88,000:
   \[
   M + H = 88,000
   \]
4. Substitute the expression for \( M \) from step 2 into the equation from step 3:
   \[
   10H + H = 88,000
   \]
5. Combine like terms:
   \[
   11H = 88,000
   \]
6. Divide both sides by 11 to solve for \( H \):
   \[
   H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
   \]

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

The final answer is: The final answer is 8,000.<|im_end|>","Let m be the number of copies Marilyn sold and h be the number Harald sold. We know that m + h = 80,000 and m = 10h.

Combining like terms, we get 11h = 88,000
Dividing both sides by 11, we get h = 8,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who actually attend.
Christina invited 16 friends.

Given that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the attendees do not show up, we can calculate the number of people who won't be attending as follows:
\[ \text{Number of non-attending guests} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of guests who will attend the party is:
\[ \text{Number of attending guests} = 16 - 4 = 12 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total cost per gift bag.
Each gift bag costs $2.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of gift bags needed.
Since each guest gets one gift bag, and there are 12 guests attending, Christina will need 12 gift bags.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Multiply the number of gift bags by the cost per bag:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = \$24 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults.
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There will be 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Amount per adult}
\]

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \times 10 \, \text{lbs/adult} = 200 \, \text{lbs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the children.
- Each child eats half the amount of an adult, so they eat 5 lbs (half of 10 lbs).

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Amount per child}
\]

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \times 5 \, \text{lbs/child} = 25 \, \text{lbs}
\]

### Step 3: Sum up the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children.
\[
\text{Total potato salad needed} = \text{Total potato salad for adults} + \text{Total potato salad for children}
\]

\[
\text{Total potato salad needed} = 200 \, \text{lbs} + 25 \, \text{lbs} = 225 \, \text{lbs}
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Ted needs to bring **225 pounds** of potato salad to the picnic to ensure there is enough for all the dinosaurs present.<|im_end|>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pets each person has based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Determine Marcia's number of pets.
- We know that Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
\[
\text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
\]

### Step 2: Determine Jan's number of pets.
- Jan has \(3\) times the number of pets Marcia has.
\[
\text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times (\text{Marcia's pets}) = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets.
- Sum the number of pets each person has.
\[
\text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets}
\]
Substitute in the values:
\[
\text{Total pets} = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28

                    Emily has 4 kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, , and ! James. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and 2 years younger than Corey. If ; James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, how old is Jackson?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how old Jackson is, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of all individuals based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( A \) represent Amy's age.
   Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
   Let \( C \) represent Corey's age.
   Let \( I \) represent James' age (given as 10).

2. **Establish Relationships:**

   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson:
     \[
     A = J + 5
     \]

   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey:
     \[
     A = C - 2
     \]

   - James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey:
     \[
     I = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad I = C - 1
     \]
     From this, we can deduce that:
     \[
     10 = C - 1 \implies C = 11
     \]

3. **Substitute Corey’s Age into Amy's Relationship:**
   Substitute \( C = 11 \) into the equation for Amy being 2 years younger than Corey:
   \[
   A = C - 2 \implies A = 11 - 2 \implies A = 9
   \]

4. **Use Amy's Age in Relation to Jackson:**
   Now substitute \( A = 9 \) into the equation for Amy being 5 years older than Jackson:
   \[
   A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   J = 9 - 5 \implies J = 4
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]<|im_end|>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original difference in speeds between Lee and Gerald.
- Let \( L \) represent Lee's original time to complete the 400-meter hurdles.
- According to the problem, Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald.
- Therefore, we can express Gerald's original time as \( G = L + 2 \).

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's original time using Lee's new time.
- After improving his diet, Gerald's speed increased by 10%.
- This means that if Lee completes the race in 38 seconds, Gerald will take 90% of that time.

So, we need to calculate \( 38 \times 0.9 \):
\[ \text{Gerald's new time} = 38 \times 0.9 = 34.2 \text{ seconds} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Gerald's new time after the improvement.
- Since Gerald's speed has improved by 10%, his new time should reflect this change.
- We know that Lee took 38 seconds initially, so Gerald’s original time \( G \) must have been 2 seconds less than Lee’s time.
- Therefore, \( G = 38 - 2 = 36 \) seconds.

### Step 4: Verify the calculation.
- With an 10% increase in speed, Gerald's new time is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{New Time for Gerald} = 36 \times 0.9 = 32.4 \text{ seconds} \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Gerald, after improving his diet, can now run the 400-meter hurdles in **32.4** seconds.<|im_end|>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

2. **Given Information:**
   - There are 60 dogs (\( D = 60 \)).
   - The number of dogs is twice the number of cats (cats per dog ratio).
   
3. **Calculate Number of Cats:**
   Since there are 60 dogs and the number of cats is half the number of dogs,
   \[
   C = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

4. **Formulate the Relationship Between Dogs and Rabbits:**
   We know that the number of rabbits (\( R \)) is twelve less than the combined number of dog and cat pets.
   Therefore,
   \[
   R = D + C - 12
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   R = 60 + 30 - 12 = 78

   \text{Total Pets} = R + D + C = 78 + 60 + 30
   \]

6. **Final Calculation:**

3. **Calculate the number of girls who are in Girl Scout:**
   - Fraction of girls in Girl Scout = 2/3
   - Number of girls in Girl Scout = (2/3) * Number of girls = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls

4. **Calculate the number of girls who are NOT in Girl Scout:**
   - Number of girls not in Girl Scout = Number of girls - Number of girls in Girl Scout = 120 - 80 = 40 girls

Therefore, the number of girls not in Girl Scout is 40.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much James slept**:
   - We know that James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept.
   - Harry slept 9 hours.
   
   To find out how long James slept, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{James' Sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Harry's Sleep}

2. **Calculate the difference in their sleeping times**:
   - We need to determine how many more hours Harry slept compared to James.
   - Harry slept 9 hours.
   - James slept 6 hours.

   The difference can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's Sleep} - \text{James' Sleep}

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Each can of tomatoes (which we'll call ""tomato cans"") loses half its volume when cooked.
   - Each tomato can holds 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Freda makes 32 ounces of sauce from her last batch.

2. **Determine how many tomato cans were used in total:**
   Since the sauce made was 32 ounces, and each can loses half its volume when cooked, each can would contribute to the sauce making process twice (once for the initial amount and once for the lost volume).

3. **Calculate the number of tomato cans needed to make 32 ounces of sauce:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of tomato cans. Each can contributes approximately 16/2 = 8 ounces of usable volume per can (since half the volume is lost).
   
   Therefore, the total volume contributed by all the cans should equal or exceed 32 ounces:
   \[
   8x \geq 32
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x \geq \frac{32}{8} = 4
   \]

   So, Freda must have used at least 4 tomato cans.

4. **Verify if exactly 4 tomato cans could make 32 ounces of sauce:**
   If Freda uses exactly 4 tomato cans:
   \[
   4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]
   This confirms that using 4 tomato cans results in exactly 32 ounces of sauce.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Freda must have used 4 tomato cans to make 32 ounces of sauce.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]<|im_end|>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes**:
   - We know that 5 cars leave the motorway during the initial 15-minute period.
   
3. **Remaining cars after the first 15 minutes**:
   - Initially, there are 30 cars.
   - After 5 cars leave, we subtract those 5 cars from the total: 
     \[
     30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cars remain}
     \]

4. **Total cars driven through initially**:
   - The total number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes includes both the 5 cars that left plus any additional cars that might have been added or removed during this time but not specified (we'll assume no other additions or removals happened).
   
5. **Final number of cars on the motorway after the traffic jam**:
   - After the initial 15 minutes, only 25 cars remain on the motorway.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has**

- Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
  
\[ \text{Total current potted plants} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many potted plants Mary will give away**

- Mary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.

\[ \text{Potted plants given away} = 1 \times 40 = 40 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining potted plants**

- Subtract the number of potted plants given away from the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.

\[ \text{Remaining potted plants} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, after giving away 1 potted plant from each ledge, Mary will have **40 potted plants left**.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of doorbells made by the second friend.
- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{5}{4} \) times more than the first friend.

\[
\text{Second friend's presses} = 20 + (20 \times \frac{5}{4}) = 20 + 25 = 45

### Step 2: Determine the number of doorbells made by the fourth friend.
- We know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

### Step 3: Determine the number of doorbells made by the third friend.
- The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.

\[
\text{Third friend's presses} = 60 + (60 \times 10) = 60 + 600 = 660

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of doorbells made.
- Add up all the presses from Jerome's friends.

\[
\text{Total presses} = 20 (\text{first friend}) + 45 (\text{second friend}) + 660 (\text{third friend}) + 60 (\text{fourth friend})

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read:**
   - Science: 4 pages
   - Social Studies: 20 pages
   - History: 7 pages
   - Geography: 8 pages

   Total pages = \( 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 \)

   Let's perform this addition:
   \[
   4 + 20 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 + 7 = 31
   \]
   \[
   31 + 8 = 39
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of pages Solo needs to read is 39.

2. **Determine the remaining days for Solo to finish his reading:**
   - Solo has 4 more days left to complete all his reading.

3. **Calculate the average number of pages Solo should read per day over the remaining days:**
   - Pages left to read: 39
   - Days left: 4

   To find the average, divide the total number of pages by the number of remaining days:
   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Days left}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{39}{4}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{39}{4} = 9.75

<|im_start|>waitress
To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to consider his drinking habits during weekdays and weekends separately.

**Step 1: Calculate daily water intake for weekdays**
- John drinks one glass of water at breakfast.
- He also drinks one glass of water at lunch.
- He drinks one glass of water at dinner.
- Therefore, he drinks 3 glasses of water per day on weekdays.

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, we calculate total weekly water intake for weekdays:
\[ \text{Weekly water intake (weekdays)} = 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ glasses/week} \]

**Step 2: Calculate weekend water intake**
- On weekends, John drinks one glass of water at breakfast.
- He drinks one glass of water at lunch.
- However, on weekends, he replaces his water intake with soda.
- Therefore, he doesn't drink any water on weekends.

So, John drinks no water on weekends.

**Step 3: Total weekly water intake**
- Weekday water intake: \(15\) glasses.
- Weekend water intake: \(0\) glasses.
Therefore, the total amount of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ \text{Total weekly water intake} = 15 \text{ glasses} + 0 \text{ glasses} = 15 \text{ glasses} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire length of the city. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the total distance covered:**
   The city is described as being 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge. Therefore, the total distance the fog bank needs to cover is 42 miles.

2. **Calculate the coverage rate per minute:**
   According to the problem, the fog bank covers every 3 miles in 10 minutes. To find out how much distance it can cover per minute, we divide the distance covered by time taken.
   
   \[
   \text{Coverage rate (miles per minute)} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}}
   \]

   Simplifying this fraction gives us:
   
   \[
   \text{Coverage rate} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

3. **Find the total time required to cover the entire city:**
   Now that we know the coverage rate, we can calculate the total time needed to cover the entire 42-mile distance. We do this by dividing the total distance by the coverage rate.
   
   \[
   \text{Total time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Distance (miles)}}{\text{Coverage Rate (\(\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{minute}}\))}}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values we have:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{\frac{3}{10} \text{ miles per minute}}
   \]

4. **Simplify the calculation:**
   To simplify this division, we multiply by the reciprocal of the coverage rate:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 42 \times \left( \frac{10}{3} \right) \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   Multiplying these together gives:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{420}{3} \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Final simplification:**
   Simplify the fraction to get the exact number of minutes:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it will take the fog bank exactly 140 minutes to cover the entire city.<|im_end|>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

To determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed, we need to follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate the number of pieces Poppy has placed:**
   - Poppy places a quarter (1/4) of the total pieces.
   - Total pieces = 1000.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pieces remaining after Poppy's placement:**
   - Remaining pieces after Poppy place them = Total pieces - Pieces placed by Poppy.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces after Poppy} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pieces added by Poppy's mom:**
   - Mom adds a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.
   - Remaining pieces before mom’s addition = 750.
   \[
   \text{Pieces added by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

4. **Determine the number of pieces left to be placed:**
   - Total pieces - Pieces added by mom = Pieces left to be placed.
   \[
   \text{Pieces left to be placed} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

### Conclusion
After following all the steps, it is clear that there are still 500 pieces left to be placed in the jigsaw puzzle.

{The final answer is}
The final answer is 500.<|im_end|>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.

\[ \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} = 15 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both.
Now, add the number of cookies that Cody and Amir eat together:
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of cookies Amir eats} + \text{Number of cookies Cody eats} \]
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 5 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 20 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the internal dimensions of one box:**
   - Each box has an outer dimension of \(5 \text{ in} \times 6 \text{ in} \times 4 \text{ in}\).
   - The thickness of the wall is \(1 \text{ in}\), so we subtract this from each dimension.
     - For length: \(5 \text{ in} - 2 \text{ in} = 3 \text{ in}\)
     - For width: \(6 \text{ in} - 2 \text{ in} = 4 \text{ in}\)
     - For height: \(4 \text{ in} - 2 \text{ in} = 2 \text{ in}\)

2. **Calculate the volume of one box:**
   - Volume of one box is given by the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is \( \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \).
   - So, the volume of one box is \( 3 \text{ in} \times 4 \text{ in} \times 2 \text{ in} = 24 \text{ in}^3 \).

3. **Calculate the total volume of all three boxes:**
   - Since there are three boxes, the total volume is \( 24 \text{ in}^3 \times 3 = 72 \text{ in}^3 \).

Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is \( 72 \text{ in}^3 \). 

Ending with {The final answer is}. The final answer is: {72}.<|im_end|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension

                    question:
                    Frankie watches TV after ; he finishes his homework every , night. , On Monday and Tuesday, he . watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of ? a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he ! finished homework early and ! watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break down Frankie's TV watching schedule and calculate the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate total hours of TV watched:**
   - Monday: 1 hour (Monday) + 1 hour (Tuesday) = 2 hours
   - Wednesday: Let \( x \) be the number of 30-minute shows watched.
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} \times 3 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Thursday: 1 hour (Thursday) + 1 hour (Friday) = 2 hours
   - Total hours watched: 7 hours

2. **Set up the equation based on total hours:**
   \[
   2 \text{ hours (Mon Tue)} + x \text{ hours (Wed)} + 2 \text{ hours (Thu Fri)} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   4 + x = 7
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 7 - 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - On Wednesday, Frankie watched 3 episodes that are 30 minutes each, totaling 90 minutes or 1.5 hours.
   - Add up all the hours from Monday to Friday:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours (Mon Tue)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (Wed)} + 2 \text{ hours (Thu Fri)} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

Since the total matches the given information, our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 3}
\]<|im_end|>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                    question:
                    Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make ; twice as many as ? he did last year. When he finishes baking, he : realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He drops 5 ! of his cookies as he is putting them out to cool, and ! now has a total of 110 cookies. How many ? cookies did Henry bake last year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine how many cookies Henry dropped
Henry had 110 cookies after dropping some. Since he originally had fewer cookies (because he was supposed to bake twice as many), let's denote the number of cookies he intended to bake as \( x \). After dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. Therefore, before dropping any cookies, he must have had:

\[ 110 + 5 = 115 \text{ cookies} \]

This means that before dropping the cookies, Henry had 115 cookies. 

### Step 2: Calculate the original amount of cookies he intended to bake
We know that Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as he actually made. So if he ended up with 115 cookies, then he intended to bake:

\[ 115 / 2 = 57.5 \text{ cookies} \]

Since he can't bake half a cookie in practice, he would round up or down to ensure he gets an integer number of whole cookies. However, since the problem doesn't specify rounding rules, we'll assume he rounded up correctly because he didn't drop any extra cookies. Thus, he intended to bake 58 cookies.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}
\]<|im_end|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                    question:
                    A local gas station is selling gas for , $3.00 a gallon.  An app company is offering $.20 cashback per gallon if you . fill up at this station.  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, : how much with their . gas be, after the cashback rewards?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost before cashback, then apply the cashback offer, and finally determine the net amount spent on 10 gallons of gas.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost before cashback**

- The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon.
- Someone buys 10 gallons of gas.

Total cost before cashback = (Price per gallon) × (Number of gallons)
= $3.00 × 10
= $30.00

**Step 2: Apply the cashback offer**

- For every 10 gallons purchased, there is a $0.20 cashback.
- Someone has bought 10 gallons.

Cashback per 10 gallons = $0.20 × 10
= $2.00

**Step 3: Determine the net amount spent**

Net amount spent = Total cost before cashback - Cashback offered
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

Therefore, after applying the cashback rewards, the person will spend $28.00 on 10 gallons of gas.

{The final answer is} $28.00<|im_end|>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for each person.
- **Beatrice's roll-ups**:
  - Width: 24 roll-ups
  - Length: 14 roll-ups
  - Total roll-ups = \(24 \times 14\)

- **Marcell's roll-ups**:
  - Width: 3 roll-ups
  - Length: 14 roll-ups
  - Total roll-ups = \(3 \times 14\)

### Step 2: Perform the multiplication for each person.

For Beatrice:
\[ 24 \times 14 = 336 \]

For Marcell:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

So, Beatrice has eaten 336 roll-ups, and Marcell has eaten 42 roll-ups.

### Step 3: Find the average number of roll-ups eaten per person.

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups by the number of people (which is 2).

Total roll-ups divided by 2:
\[ \frac{336 + 42}{2} \]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression.

First, add the totals:
\[ 336 + 42 = 378 \]

Now, divide by 2:
\[ \frac{378}{2} = 189 \]

Therefore, the average number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice is 189.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The average number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice is **189**.<|im_end|>","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.
Marcell ate 42 because 14 x 3 = <<14*3=42>>42

                    question:
                    Julia’s boat sprang a leak while she was out on the lake. The ; boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she ! rowed back towards shore. ?

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much water the boat has taken on by the time Julia reaches the shore, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the speed of the boat:**
   - Julia rows at a rate of 20 feet per 16 seconds.
   - To find her speed in feet per second (fps), divide the distance by time:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ fps}
     \]

2. **Determine the total distance traveled:**
   - Julia's journey consists of a 20-foot segment followed by another 64-foot segment.
   - Total distance:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 20 \text{ feet} + 64 \text{ feet} = 84 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water added per foot of travel:**
   - The boat adds 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it travels.

4. **Compute the total number of 10-foot segments in the entire journey:**
   - Divide the total distance by 10:
     \[
     \text{Number of Segments} = \frac{84 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 8.4 \text{ segments}
     \]
   
5. **Determine the total amount of water added:**
   - Multiply the number of segments by the amount of water added per segment:
     \[
     \text{Total Water Added} = 8.4 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 16.8 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on \( \boxed{16.8 \text{ liters}} \) of water.<|im_end|>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.

In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers that grew.
- We know that out of the 30 flowers planted, only 5 did not grow.

Step 3: Subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total planted to find the number of growing flowers.
- Number of growing flowers = Total flowers planted - Non-growing flowers
= 30 flowers - 5 flowers
= 25 flowers

Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that have grown.

The final answer is: The final answer is 25.<|im_end|>","Ryan plants 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 flowers in total.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.
2. Use the information about the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and the number of birds in Jamal's photo to find out how many birds are in the picture.
3. Calculate the total number of ducks in Jamal's photograph based on the given number of birds.

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Determine the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold:**
   - We know from the problem statement that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

2. **Use the relationship between the number of photographs on Jamal's phone and the number of birds in his photo:**
   - According to the problem, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
     Therefore, if Brittany's phone can hold \( B \) photographs, then Jamal's phone can hold \( 6B \) photographs.
   - Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we have:
     \[
     6B = 1800
     \]
   - Solving for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

3. **Calculate the total number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - We are told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo.
     Therefore, the number of birds in Jamal's photograph (let's call it \( N \)) is related to the number of photographs on Brittany's phone (\( B \)):
     \[
     N = \frac{B}{50}
     \]
   - Substituting the value of \( B \) (which is 300):
     \[
     N = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]
   - This means there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph.

4. **Calculate the total number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:**
   - Since each bird represents one duck, the total number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is equal to the number of birds in the photograph.
   - Thus, the total number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is also 6.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]<|im_end|>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the original price per board before the increase.
Sasha originally bought the lumber at a certain price per unit (board). Let's denote this original price as \( P \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of boards Sasha has left.
- Ten 2x4x10 boards: \( 10 \times 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 800 \) boards.
- Five 4x4x10 boards: \( 5 \times 4 \times 4 \times 10 = 800 \) boards.

Total number of boards left = \( 800 + 800 = 1600 \) boards.

### Step 3: Determine the new selling price per board.
Since the prices went up by 50%, the new selling price per board will be \( 1.5P \).

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards.
Revenue from selling the 1600 boards at the new price \( 1.5P \):
\[ \text{Revenue} = 1600 \times 1.5P = 2400P \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of buying the original quantity of lumber.
Let's assume the original price per board was \( P \), so the total cost of buying 1600 boards would be:
\[ \text{Cost} = 1600 \times P \]

### Step 6: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 2400P - 1600P = 800P \]

So, the profit Sasha makes when selling all the lumber is \( 800P \).

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} \( 800P \).<|im_end|>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100

### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the ratio
Let \( S \) represent the number of teaspoons of sugar and \( W \) represent the number of cups of water.

From the ratio, we can write:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

### Step 3: Solve for one variable in terms of the other
Since we only have information about the amount of sugar (which is \( S \)), let's express \( W \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ W = \frac{13}{7}S \]

### Step 4: Substitute into the total quantity equation
Given that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons:
\[ S + W = 120 \]

Substitute \( W \) from Step 3 into the above equation:
\[ S + \frac{13}{7}S = 120 \]

### Step 5: Combine like terms
Combine the terms involving \( S \):
\[ S \left(1 + \frac{13}{7}\right) = 120 \]
\[ S \left(\frac{7}{7} + \frac{13}{7}\right) = 120 \]
\[ S \left(\frac{20}{7}\right) = 120 \]

### Step 6: Simplify the equation
Divide both sides by \( \frac{20}{7} \):
\[ S = \frac{120}{\frac{20}{7}} \]
\[ S = 120 \times \frac{7}{20} \]
\[ S = 6 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 42 \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is \( 42 \).<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the ingredients she used to make the coffee is 7+13 = <<7+13=20>>20

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much John paid in total for the shoes, let's break this down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pairs of shoes John buys:**
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes per child.

   \[
   \text{Total pairs} = 3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of one pair of shoes:**
   - Each pair costs $60.

   \[
   \text{Cost per pair} = \$60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for all pairs of shoes:**
   - We need to multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60 \text{ per pair} = \$360

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many containers were imported on the second day based on the information provided.

1. **First Day Calculation:**
   - On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
   - Total number of vehicles on the first day = \( 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \).

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day:**
   - According to the problem, after the second day, the total number of vehicles was 30.

3. **Calculate Number of Containers Imported on the Second Day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the second day onwards would be \( x \times 5 \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The sum of the vehicles from both days should equal the total number of vehicles given (30).
   - So, \( 10 \text{ vehicles (first day)} + (x \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container}) = 30 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 10 + 5x = 30 \).
   - Subtract 10 from both sides: \( 5x = 20 \).
   - Divide both sides by 5: \( x = 4 \).

Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.<|im_end|>","On the first day, 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles were Imported,

                    question:
                    Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary , had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what ? he was making four years ago. If , Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the ; total salary the two were : receiving four years later?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate Lylah's initial salary:**
   - Let \( L \) be Lylah's initial salary.
   - Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Adrien's initial salary \( A_0 = 1.3L \).
   
2. **Determine Adrien's current salary after increasing it by 40%:**
   - After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%, so his new salary \( A_{\text{new}} = A_0 \times (1 + 0.4) \).
   - Substitute \( A_0 = 1.3L \):
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} = 1.3L \times 1.4 = 1.82L
     \]

3. **Compare Adrien’s current salary to Lylah's current salary:**
   - According to the problem, Adrien's current salary is 40% higher than Lylah's current salary. Therefore,
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} = 1.4A_{\text{old}}
     \]
     where \( A_{\text{old}} \) is Lylah's salary four years ago.

4. **Express Lylah's salary in terms of her old salary:**
   - We know that Adrien's salary increased from \( A_0 \) to \( A_{\text{new}} \), which means:
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} = 1.3L \times 1.4 = 1.82L
     \]
     So, Lylah's salary now must also increase by 40% to match Adrien's increase:
     \[
     L_{\text{current}} = L_{\text{old}} \times 1.4
     \]

5. **Set up the equation for Adrien's and Lylah's salaries at the same time:**
   - Since both their salaries have increased proportionally over time, they will be equal when their salaries reach their maximum point. Given that Adrien's salary increased by 40% compared to his initial salary, let's denote his current salary as \( A_{\text{new}} \). Lylah's salary increases similarly but starts from a different point.
     \[
     A_{\text{new}} = 1.4L_{\text{old}}
     \]

6. **Substitute back into the proportional relationship:**
   - From the previous calculation, we know \( A_{\text{new}} = 1.82L \). Equate these expressions:
     \[
     1.82L = 1.4L_{\text{old}}
     \]
   - Solving for \( L_{\text{old}} \):
     \[
     L_{\text{old}} = \frac{1.82L}{1.4} = 1.3L
     \]

7. **Calculate the total combined salary:**
   - Now, knowing \( L_{\text{old}} = 1.3L \), we can find the total combined salary:
     \[
     \text{Total Salary} = L_{\text{old}} + A_{\text{new}} = 1.3L + 1.82L = 3.12L
     \]

### Conclusion:
Adrien's and Lylah's total combined salary four years later would be \(3.12L\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Total Salary} = 3.12L}
\]<|im_end|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fruits Morisette and Kael brought and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought:**
   - Morisette brought 5 apples.
   - Morisette also brought 8 oranges.

2. **Calculate the number of fruits Kael brought:**
   - Morisette brought twice as much apples as Kael. Therefore, if \( A_m \) represents the number of apples Morisette brought, then \( A_m = 5 \).
     \[
     A_k = \frac{A_m}{2} = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Morisette brought half as many oranges as Kael. Therefore, if \( O_m \) represents the number of oranges Morisette brought, then \( O_m = 8 \).
     \[
     O_k = \frac{O_m}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Sum the fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:**
   - Total apples from Morisette: \( 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 \)
   - Total oranges from Morisette: \( 8 + 4 = 12 \)

So, Morisette brings a total of \( 7.5 \) apples and \( 12 \) oranges.
Kael brings a total of \( 0 \) apples (since he didn't mention any apples), and \( 4 \) oranges.

Adding these together gives us the total number of fruits:

\[
Total \, Fruits = (Morisette's \, Apples + Kael's \, Apples) + (Morisette's \, Oranges + Kael's \, Oranges)
\]
\[
= (7.5 + 0) + (12 + 4)
\]
\[
= 7.5 + 16
\]
\[
= 23.5

To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running pace into two parts: before and after she reaches a slower speed.

### Step 1: Calculate distance covered during the first part (run at 10 mph)

Rosie runs at a constant speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining time and calculate distance covered during the second part (run at 5 mph)

After covering 30 miles, Rosie has \(7 - 3 = 4\) hours left to cover additional distance at her reduced speed of 5 miles per hour.
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 3: Add both distances together to get total distance

Total Distance = Distance covered in the first part + Distance covered in the second part
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 50 miles.<|im_end|>","For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
>To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of letters that needed stamps initially**: Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, let \( x \) be the total number of letters needing stamps initially.
2. **Calculate the number of letters already stamped after putting on the necessary stamps**: After putting stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, she would have used \( \frac{x}{3} \) stamps. Therefore, the remaining letters needing stamps without any stamps will be \( \frac{2x}{3} \).
3. **Relate the remaining letters needing stamps to the letters already stamped**: We know that out of these remaining letters needing stamps, 30 letters are already stamped. So, if \( y \) represents the number of letters already stamped, then \( \frac{y}{x} = \frac{2x/3}{x} \). This simplifies to \( \frac{y}{x} = \frac{2}{3} \), meaning \( y = \frac{2}{3}x \).

4. **Set up an equation based on the information given**: The total number of letters needing stamps minus the number of letters already stamped equals the sum of the letters needing stamps plus the letters already stamped: 
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = 30 + y
   \]
   Simplifying further gives us:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 30 + y
   \]

5. **Substitute \( y \) from step 3 into the equation**: Substituting \( y = \frac{2}{3}x \) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 30 + \frac{2}{3}x
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**: Let's isolate \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{2}{3}x = 30
   \]
   Factor out \( \frac{2}{3} \) from the left side:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}(x - x) = 30
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}(0) = 30
   \]
   Clearly, something went wrong here because it results in an inconsistent equation. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

7. **Re-examine the relationship between the numbers**: Given \( \frac{2}{3}x \) represents the number of letters already stamped, which equals 30, we can directly relate back to the original setup where \( \frac{2}{3}x \) must represent the proportion of letters already stamped. 

8. **Final calculation**:
   From the initial setup, since \( \frac{2}{3}x = 30 \), we find \( x \) as follows:
   \[
   x = \frac{30 \times 3}{2} = 45
   \]

Therefore, the number of letters that needed stamps initially was 45.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 45.<|im_end|>","She stamped 60/3=<<60/3=20>>20 letters.

<|im_start|>waiter
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - Julia needed plastic spoons for her stew.
   - She initially ran out of spoons and bought a new package.

2. **Additional Items Bought**:
   - Her husband bought an additional package of spoons.
   - The package contains 5 more spoons than the first one.

3. **Spoons Used**:
   - Julia used 3 spoons from the initial package to taste her stew.
   - After using these 3 spoons, there were 9 spoons left in the initial package (since 3 + 6 = 9).

4. **Spoons Left on Table**:
   - Julia has 12 spoons in total after setting the table.

Now, let's determine how many spoons were originally in the initial package before Julia bought another one.

- Since Julia ended up with 12 spoons in total after adding the extra 5 spoons her husband bought, we can deduce that she started with 7 spoons from the initial package (because 12 - 5 = 7).

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 7 spoons.

{The final answer is} 7<|im_end|>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.
Since the husband bought a package of five spoons, then Julia's package contained 15-5=<<15-5=10>>10 spoons.

- Therefore, Amy's number of friends = Lily's number of friends + 20.
\[ \text{Amy's friends} = 50 + 20 = 70 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of friends both Amy and Lily have together.
- The total number of friends is the sum of Amy's friends and Lily's friends.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item based on the given relationships and then calculate the total cost for the items Dillon buys.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the cost of a watermelon:**
   - We know that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon.
   - Let \( W \) represent the cost of one watermelon.
   - Therefore, the cost of one orange would be \( W - 5 \).

2. **Establish the relationship between a watermelon and a pepper:**
   - A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper.
   - Let \( P \) represent the cost of one pepper.
   - Thus, \( W = 3P \).

3. **Calculate the cost of a watermelon using the relationship with a pepper:**
   - Substitute \( P \) from the previous equation into \( W = 3P \).
   - This gives us \( W = 3(15) = 45 \). So, the cost of one watermelon is $45.

4. **Verify the cost of an orange:**
   - Using the cost of a watermelon, calculate the cost of an orange.
   - The cost of an orange should be \( 45 - 5 = 40 \).

5. **Determine the number of each item Dillon buys:**
   - Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

6. **Calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:**
   - Watermelons: \( 4 \times 45 = 180 \)
   - Peppers: \( 20 \times 15 = 300 \)
   - Oranges: \( 10 \times 40 = 400 \)

7. **Sum up all the costs to find the total amount Dillon spends:**
   - Total cost = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges
   - Total cost = \( 180 + 300 + 400 = 980 \)

### Conclusion:
The total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{980}\).<|im_end|>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
He used a total of 400 + 300 + 180 = $<<400+300+180=880>>880.

                    question:
                    A hospital sees 500 people , a day.  Each patient is seen for , an average of 24 minutes.  The doctors charge ! $150 an hour to the hospital and the hospital charges the : patients $200 an hour.  How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the hospital's profit, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on all visits.
Each visit takes 24 minutes, which is equivalent to \(\frac{24}{60} = 0.4\) hours.

Given that there are 500 people per day, the total number of hours spent on all visits in one day is:
\[ 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Determine the revenue generated by the hospital from these visits.
The hospital charges $200 per hour to its patients, so the total revenue generated from these visits is:
\[ 200 \times 500 = \$100,000 \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost incurred by the hospital.
The hospital charges $150 per doctor-hour, but since the exact number of doctors isn't specified, we assume they have enough staff to cover this rate without additional costs. Therefore, the total cost for the hospital is simply the sum of the hourly rates charged to patients and the staff’s hourly wages (though not explicitly calculated here).

Since the problem doesn’t specify the number of doctors or their hourly wage, let's denote it as \(C\). For simplicity, if we consider the cost structure as described, the total cost would be:
\[ C \times 200 = \$200C \]
This indicates that the cost calculation assumes a direct proportionality between the number of doctors and the overall cost structure.

### Step 4: Calculate the hospital's profit.
Profit can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
Substituting the values obtained:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$100,000 - \$200C \]

### Final Answer:
If we don't know the specific number of doctors (\(C\)), the expression for the hospital's profit remains:
\[ \boxed{\text{Profit} = \$100,000 - \$200C} \]<|im_end|>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many elves quit initially.
- We know that one-third of the elves quit after they vomit on them.
- Since there are 60 elves total, one-third of them would be \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) elves.

Step 2: Subtract the number of elves who quit due to vomiting from the initial count.
- After vomiting, 40 elves remain (since \( 60 - 20 = 40 \)).

Step 3: Determine how many elves quit later.
- We're told that 10 more elves quit because kids kicked their shins.
- So, after kicking their shins, \( 40 - 10 = 30 \) elves are still working.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 elves are left.<|im_end|>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rides and then multiply that by the cost per ride.

1. **Calculate the total number of rides:**
   - Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
   - Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
   - Pam also rode the luge 2 times.
   - Fred also rode the luge 2 times.

   Total rides for Pam = (Roller Coaster) + (Luge) = 2 + 2 = 4 rides

   Combined total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = 4 + 6 = 10 rides

2. **Calculate the total ticket cost:**
   Each ride costs 6 tickets.
   
   Total tickets used = Number of rides × Cost per ride
                        = 10 rides × 6 tickets/ride

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
   - On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday = \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the total number of miles Walt walked from Monday to Tuesday:**
   - Total miles from Monday to Tuesday = Monday's miles + Tuesday's miles
   - This gives us \( 4 + 24 = 28 \) miles.

3. **Determine the total number of miles Walt walked from Monday to Wednesday:**
   - The problem states that his total mileage from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday.
   - So, the equation for the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is \( 28 + x = 41 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 28 from both sides of the equation to isolate \( x \).
     \[
     x = 41 - 28

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the food items**

- Subs: \(2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00\)
- Chips: \(2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00\)
- Cookies: \(2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00\)

Total cost of food items = \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00

**Step 2: Add the delivery fee**

Delivery fee = 20% of total food cost

Delivery fee amount = \(0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00\)

**Step 3: Add the tip**

Tip = \$5.00

**Step 4: Sum up all costs including food, delivery, and tip**

Total cost = Food cost + Delivery fee + Tip

Total cost = \$20.00 + \$4.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00

Therefore, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is **\$29.00**.<|im_end|>","2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00

                    question:
                    Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of ; 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of ? 100 questions at the ; same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and : 6 hours to complete ! the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many questions Mark left incomplete after completing both tests.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the first test.
- The total number of questions in the first test is 75.
- Mark completes the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- Mark has 8 hours to complete the first test.

First, calculate the time taken to complete the first test:
\[ \text{Time for first test} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions Mark can answer in 8 hours:
\[ \text{Questions answered in 8 hours} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, subtract the number of questions answered from the total number of questions:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions in first test} = 75 - 40 = 35 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Mark answered in the second test.
- The total number of questions in the second test is 100.
- Mark completes the test at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- Mark has 6 hours to complete the second test.

First, calculate the time taken to complete the second test:
\[ \text{Time for second test} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the number of questions Mark can answer in 6 hours:
\[ \text{Questions answered in 6 hours} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

Now, subtract the number of questions answered from the total number of questions:
\[ \text{Incomplete questions in second test} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of questions Mark left incomplete.
Add the number of incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ \text{Total incomplete questions} = 35 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{105}

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( P \) represent the number of pink gumballs.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of blue gumballs.

2. **Set up the relationship between pink and blue gumballs:**
   According to the problem, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs compared to the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
   \[
   P = 4B + 22
   \]

3. **Substitute the given value for blue gumballs:**
   We know that there are 12 blue gumballs (\( B = 12 \)).

4. **Solve for the number of pink gumballs:**
   Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
   \[
   P = 4 \times 12 + 22

To determine the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the total number of cars.
There are 20 cars in total.

Step 2: Determine how many cars are either automatic or manual.
- Automatic cars = 12
- Manual cars = 4

Step 3: Calculate the number of semi-automatic cars.
Since there are only two types (automatic and manual) mentioned, all other cars must be semi-automatic.
Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars = Semi-automatic cars
20 - 12 - 4 = 4 semi-automatic cars

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of cars that are semi-automatic.
(Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100%
= (4 / 20) * 100%
= 0.2 * 100%
= 20%

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The percentage of cars that are semi-automatic is 20%.<|im_end|>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of different types of bees:

- Let \( W \) be the number of worker bees.
- Let \( B \) be the number of baby bees.
- Let \( Q \) be the number of queens.

We are given three pieces of information:

1. The total number of bees is 700: 
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
\[ W = 2B \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
\[ B = 2Q \]

First, we can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( B \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ B = 2Q \]

Now substitute this expression for \( B \) into the first equation:
\[ W + (2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ W + 3Q = 700 \]

Next, we use the first equation again to express \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) \]
\[ W = 4Q \]

Now substitute this expression for \( W \) into the modified first equation:
\[ 4Q + 3Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]

Solve for \( Q \):
\[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now that we have the value of \( Q \), we can find \( B \) using the relationship between \( B \) and \( Q \):
\[ B = 2Q \]
\[ B = 2 \times 100 \]
\[ B = 200 \]

Finally, we can find \( W \) using the relationship between \( W \) and \( B \):
\[ W = 2B \]
\[ W = 2 \times 200 \]
\[ W = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is:
\[
\boxed{400}

**Step 2: Calculate total weekly gaming time**
There are 7 days in a week.
Total weekly gaming time = 2 hours/day * 7 days/week = 14 hours/week

**Step 3: Calculate earnings from part-time job**
Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job.
Earnings from part-time job = Total weekly gaming time * Hourly wage

   - Cups: $3
   - Roach Traps: $4

2. **Calculate the total cost before tax**:
   \[

   \]

3. **Determine the tax amount**:
   - There is a 10% tax on non-food items (Milk, Eggs, Light Bulbs, and Roach Traps).
   - Calculate the tax on each non-food item:
     - Milk: \( \$2 \times 0.10 = \$0.20 \)
     - Eggs: \( \$3 \times 0.10 = \$0.30 \)
     - Light Bulbs: \( \$3 \times 0.10 = \$0.30 \)

To calculate the weekly profit for Kim's housekeeping business, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Expenses:**
   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloth.
   - Cost per bottle of bleach = $2
   - Cost per pack of cloth = $5

2. **Total cost calculation:**

   - For one client:
     \[
     \text{Bottles of bleach} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \quad (\text{since there are } 3 \text{ current clients})
     \]
     \[

3. **Calculate Total Income:**
   - Total income per week = $92

4. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit = Total income - Total costs

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples per hectare.
John has 10 hectares of land, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare.

\[ \text{Total pineapples per hectare} = 100 \]

Since he has 10 hectares, we multiply this by the number of pineapples per hectare:

\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \]

So, John has 1000 pineapples on his entire field.

### Step 2: Determine how often John harvests his pineapples.
John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

### Step 3: Calculate how many times John can harvest in one year.
There are 12 months in a year.

\[ \text{Number of harvests per year} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

This means John can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.
We already know that John has 1000 pineapples per harvest.

\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \]

Therefore, John can harvest **4000** pineapples within a year.<|im_end|>","John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Lego pieces Johnny has in total after picking them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of Lego pieces in the second box:**
   - The first Lego box contains 500 pieces.
   - The second box contains 3 times as many pieces as the first box.
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces in the second box} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of Lego pieces in the third box:**
   - The third box contains 1/4 (one quarter) of the number of pieces in the first box.
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces in the third box} = \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125
   \]

3. **Add up all the pieces:**
   - Add the number of pieces from the first, second, and third boxes together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of pieces} = 500 + 1500 + 125
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of pieces} = 2125
   \]

### Conclusion:
Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

                    question:
                    Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. , She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 : hours, and ? then . she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Bee Departure
Debra initially sees 30 bees leaving the hive.

### Step 2: Return Rate Calculation
She sees half of those 30 bees returning in the next 6 hours.
- Number of bees returning = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)

### Step 3: Additional Departures
In the next 6 hours, she sees twice as many bees leaving compared to the initial departure.
- Number of additional bees leaving = \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \)

### Step 4: Total Departures
Total number of bees that leave the hive over these 12 hours:
\[ 30 (\text{initial}) + 60 (\text{additional}) = 90 \]

### Step 5: Returnees Calculation
She sees 1/2 of those 90 bees return after they leave.
- Number of bees returning = \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \)

### Step 6: Remaining Bees Before Return
Initially, there were 30 bees that didn’t return yet.

### Step 7: Final Count of Returning Bees
After all the departures, she sees 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is **45**.<|im_end|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
2. Use that information to find out how many Facebook friends James has.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has
We know from the problem statement that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. We also know that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.

Given:
- Charlie = 3 * Dorothy

We can set up an equation based on this relationship:
\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Now, solve for Dorothy's friends:
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

### Step 2: Calculate how many Facebook friends James has
According to the problem, James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. 

We already found that Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends. So, let's calculate:
\[ \text{James' friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ \text{James' friends} = 4 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{James' friends} = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

                    question:
                    Steve and Tim decide to see who , can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further . away than Tim, so he is allowed ! to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can : bike at 440 : feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from , the school. !

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine who wins the race and for how long they wait, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach home.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by each person
- **Steve's Distance**: 
  - Steve lives 3 miles from the school.
  
- **Tim's Distance**:
  - Tim lives 2 miles from the school.

### Step 2: Convert distances into units consistent for comparison (feet)
Since both distances are given in miles and converted to feet:
- \(1 \text{ mile} = 5280 \text{ feet}\)

So,
- **Steve’s Distance**:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- **Tim’s Distance**:
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time taken by each person to travel their respective distances
- **Time taken by Steve**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Steve}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Steve}}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Time taken by Tim**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Tim}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Tim}}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the winner and the time difference
- **Winner**:
  - The person who completes the race faster is the winner.
  - Since Steve completed in 36 minutes and Tim in 40 minutes, Steve is the winner.

- **Waiting Time**:
  - To find out how long the winner waits before the loser finishes, subtract the time taken by the winner from the time taken by the loser.
  - Time difference:
    \[
    \text{Wait Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}}
    \]
    \[
    \text{Wait Time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
    \]

### Final Answer:
The winner is Steve, and the winner waits 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race. Thus, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 4 minutes.<|im_end|>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.
Steve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of tires inflated.
2. Determine the cost per tire.
3. Compute the total revenue from inflating the tires.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated
- **Bicycles**: 5 people × 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
- **Tricycles**: 3 people × 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
- **Unicycles**: 1 person × 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire

Total number of tires = 10 (bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires

### Step 2: Determine the cost per tire
Cost per tire = $0.25

### Step 3: Compute the total revenue
Revenue = Total number of tires × Cost per tire
= 20 tires × $0.25/tire = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day.

- Each pack contains six cookies.
Therefore, the total number of cookies is \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \).

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
Therefore, the total cost for all the cookies is \( 60 \times 0.10 = \$6.00 \).

Step 3: Determine how much money Carl paid initially.
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.

Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid to find out the change.
\( \$10 - \$6 = \$4 \)

Final Answer:
The final answer is The change Carl receives is $4.<|im_end|>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many fries Dave ate**:
   - Dave ate 14 fries.

2. **Calculate how many fries the seagull ate**:
   - The seagull ate half of what Dave ate.
   - Seagull's fries = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \) = 7 fries.

3. **Account for the pigeons**:
   - Three pigeons ate 3 fries each.
   - Pigeon's fries = \( 3 \times 3 \) = 9 fries.

4. **Calculate the remaining fries after these events**:
   - Initial fries: 14
   - After seagull: 14 - 7 = 7 fries left
   - After pigeons: 7 - 9 = -2 fries (which doesn't make sense, so we need to re-evaluate)

5. **Re-evaluate the pigeons' behavior**:
   - Since they only ate three fries but there are still fries left, it means one or more pigeons must have been eating them throughout the process, not just at once.
   - Let's assume the pigeons ate some fries throughout the process without counting them separately initially.

6. **Consider the raccoon**:
   - A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   - Remaining fries before raccoon = 7
   - Raccoon's fries = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 7 \) = \( \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \) fries (rounded down to 4 since partial fries don't exist)
   - Fries left after raccoon = 7 - 4 = 3 fries.

7. **Final count of fries left**:
   - Ants carried off one fries, leaving 5 fries behind.
   - Therefore, the total number of fries in the pack was 8.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 8.<|im_end|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.
The 3 pigeons ate 3 each, so they ate 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 fries.
The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

   - Kimo also has classes on Tuesday and Thursday.

   Let's calculate the total number of days he attends classes in one week:
   \[
   \text{Total days per week} = 3 (\text{Monday, Wednesday, Friday}) + 2 (\text{Tuesday, Thursday}) = 5 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Determine the duration of each class period:**
   - Each class lasts for 1 hour.

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent in class per week:**
   \[
   \text{Hours per week} = \text{Number of days per week} \times \text{Duration of each class}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours per week} = 5 \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 5 \text{ hours/week}

4. **Calculate the total number of hours spent in class over the entire semester (16 weeks):**
   \[
   \text{Total hours per semester} = \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours per semester} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 80 \text{ hours}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the length of each type of baked good**

- **Rolls**: 
  - Length per roll = 4 inches
  - Number of rolls = 300
  - Total length for rolls = \(300 \times 4\) inches = 1200 inches

- **Chocolate Croissants**:
  - Length per croissant = 6 inches
  - Number of croissants = 120
  - Total length for croissants = \(120 \times 6\) inches = 720 inches

- **Baguettes**:
  - Length per baguette = 2 feet
  - Convert feet to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches):
    - Length per baguette = 2 * 12 inches = 24 inches
  - Number of baguettes = 60
  - Total length for baguettes = \(60 \times 24\) inches = 1440 inches

**Step 2: Sum up the total lengths**

- Total length from rolls = 1200 inches
- Total length from croissants = 720 inches
- Total length from baguettes = 1440 inches

- **Total length in inches** = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 inches

**Step 3: Convert the total length to feet**

                    question:
                    The zookeeper ? feeds all the apes in ? the zoo. He orders all the bananas from a local farm every 2 months. If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas , need 400 bananas, and the baboons need . 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order ; to last for 2 months?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order over two months, let's break down the requirements for each group of animals:

1. **Monkeys**: Need 200 bananas per month.
   - Over 2 months: \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

2. **Gorillas**: Need 400 bananas per month.
   - Over 2 months: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

3. **Baboons**: Need 100 bananas per month.
   - Over 2 months: \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Next, we sum up the total number of bananas needed for each group over the 2-month period:

- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

Total bananas required over 2 months:
\[400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\]

<|im_start|>system
To determine how far each person runs, we need to calculate the distance for both Blake and Kelly.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### **Blake's Run:**
1. **Length of one lap:** The length of one lap (back and forth) is \(2 \times 100\) yards = 200 yards.
2. **Number of laps Blake runs:** Blake runs 15 times.
   - Total distance for Blake: \(200 \text{ yards/lap} \times 15 \text{ laps} = 3000 \text{ yards}\).

#### **Kelly's Run:**
1. **Distance from starting point to 40 yards line and back:** This is half the total distance of the football field because the starting point is at the end of the first lap.
   - Distance per segment: \(\frac{100}{2} = 50\) yards.
2. **Number of segments Kelly runs:** Kelly runs this distance 34 times.
   - Total distance for Kelly: \(50 \text{ yards/segment} \times 34 \text{ segments} = 1700 \text{ yards}\).

### Final Comparison:
- **Distance Blake runs:** 3000 yards.
- **Distance Kelly runs:** 1700 yards.

Since 3000 > 1700, Blake wins the contest. 

Therefore, **the winner runs farther** than the loser by **\(3000 \text{ yards} - 1700 \text{ yards} = 1300 \text{ yards}\)**.<|im_end|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Raphael spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of each item he purchased and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the pens:**
   - Number of pens: 4
   - Cost per pen: $1.5
   - Total cost for pens = Number of pens × Cost per pen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pens} = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Number of notebooks: 2
   - Cost per notebook: $4
   - Total cost for notebooks = Number of notebooks × Cost per notebook
   \[
   \text{Total cost for notebooks} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the bond paper:**
   - Cost of the bond paper: $20
   - Total cost for the bond paper = $20

4. **Sum up all the costs:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for pens} + \text{Total cost for notebooks} + \text{Total cost for the bond paper}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Initial number of tadpoles**
Finn initially sees 11 tadpoles in the pond.

**Step 2: Tadpoles that emerge from hiding**
Suddenly, 6 tadpoles come out of hiding under a lily pad.
- Subtract these from the initial count: \( 11 - 6 = 5 \)

So far, Finn has seen:
\[ 11 - 6 = 5 \text{ tadpoles} \]

**Step 3: Tadpoles that re-hide**
Then, 2 tadpoles hide back under a rock.
- Add these to the current count: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)

Therefore, the total number of tadpoles Finn currently sees in the pond is:
\[ 5 \text{ (initial)} + 2 \text{ (re-hid)} = 7 \]

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 7. Finn can still see 7 tadpoles in the pond.<|im_end|>","When the hidden tadpoles come out, Finn sees 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 tadpoles swimming.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the water depth on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.

- Water depth on Monday = 17 feet
- Additional water on Tuesday = 7 feet

Water depth on Tuesday = Water depth on Monday + Additional water on Tuesday
\[ \text{Water depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the water depth on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.

- Water depth on Tuesday = 24 feet
- Fraction of Tuesday's water that remains on Wednesday = \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Water depth on Wednesday = Fraction of Tuesday's water * Water depth on Tuesday
\[ \text{Water depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Water depth on Wednesday} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

<|im_start|>ystem
To determine the total number of fish that both Anakin and Locsin were able to catch, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fish Anakin caught.
Anakin's catches:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Total for Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.

### Step 2: Determine how many fish Locsin caught based on Anakin’s catches.
Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin

First, let's calculate how many fewer or more Locsin caught compared to Anakin:

- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \) fewer
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \) fewer
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) more

Now, subtract the difference from each type of fish caught by Locsin:

- Starfish: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish: \( 3 + 5 = 8 \)

Next, add up all the fish caught by Locsin:
\[ 5 (starfish) + 3 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 16 \]

### Step 3: Sum the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin.
Total fish caught = Anakin's total + Locsin's total
\[ 19 (Anakin) + 16 (Locsin) = 35 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin were able to catch is **35**.<|im_end|>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.

They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Price Calculation**:
   - The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Price Increase Rate**:
   - The price increases by 20% of the current price every two months.

3. **Calculating the Price After Each Two Months**:
   - Let \( P \) be the price at any given time.
   - The increase in price over one period (two months) is \( 0.20 \times P \).

4. **Finding the New Price**:
   - After one period (two months), the new price will be:
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = P + 0.20 \times P = 1.20 \times P
     \]

5. **Applying the Formula Iteratively**:
   - We need to apply this formula three times because there are 36 months, which is equivalent to 18 periods of two months.

Let's calculate the price after each iteration:

- Initial price: $20
- After first two months: 
  \[
  P_1 = 20 \times 1.20 = 24
  \]
- After next two months (four months):
  \[
  P_2 = 24 \times 1.20 = 28.8
  \]
- After next two months (six months):
  \[
  P_3 = 28.8 \times 1.20 = 34.56
  \]
- After next two months (eight months):
  \[
  P_4 = 34.56 \times 1.20 = 41.472
  \]
- After next two months (ten months):
  \[
  P_5 = 41.472 \times 1.20 = 49.7664
  \]
- After next two months (twelve months):
  \[
  P_6 = 49.7664 \times 1.20 = 59.71968
  \]
- After next two months (thirteen months):
  \[
  P_7 = 59.71968 \times 1.20 = 71.663616
  \]
- After next two months (fourteen months):
  \[
  P_8 = 71.663616 \times 1.20 = 85.9963456
  \]
- After next two months (fifteen months):
  \[
  P_9 = 85.9963456 \times 1.20 = 103.19561472
  \]
- After next two months (sixteen months):
  \[
  P_{10} = 103.19561472 \times 1.20 = 123.834737664
  \]
- After next two months (seventeen months):
  \[
  P_{11} = 123.834737664 \times 1.20 = 148.6016852976
  \]
- After next two months (eighteen months):
  \[
  P_{12} = 148.6016852976 \times 1.20 = 178.32198235712
  \]

After calculating the price for all eighteen iterations, we find that after 36 months (or 18 periods of two months), the price of the bag of marbles would be approximately $178.32.<|im_end|>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4

To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each toy based on the given information and then sum up their values.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( R \) represent the cost of one red car.
   - Let \( A \) represent the cost of one action figure.
   - Let \( D \) represent the cost of one doll.

2. **Given Information**:
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - There is 1 doll.
   - One red car costs $4.
   - One action figure costs $5 (given).

3. **Calculate Costs for Red Cars**:
   Since there are 5 red cars and each costs $4, the total cost for red cars is:
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Costs for Action Figures**:
   Since there are 3 action figures and each costs $5, the total cost for action figures is:
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine Cost of Doll**:
   According to the problem, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures plus one red car. Therefore, the doll's cost can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   D = 3A + R
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   D = 3(5) + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Sum Up All Toy Values**:
   Now, add up the costs of all toys:
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = \text{Cost of Red Cars} + \text{Cost of Action Figures} + \text{Cost of Doll}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Value} = 20 + 15 + 19 = 54 \text{ dollars}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many times Sandra must babysit, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Eggs Needed for Spanish Flans
Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan. For 15 Spanish flans, the total number of eggs required is:
\[ \text{Total eggs needed} = 15 \times 3 = 45 \]

### Step 2: Determine Number of Eggs Given per Babysitting Session
Sandra receives 9 eggs from her neighbor each time she babysits.

### Step 3: Calculate Number of Times Sandra Must Babysit
To find out how many times Sandra must babysit to collect at least 45 eggs, divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs given per session (9):
\[ \text{Number of sessions} = \frac{45}{9} = 5 \]

Therefore, Sandra must babysit **5** times to gather enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

### Final Answer

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.
   Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
     \[
     S = 2B
     \]
   - In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
     \[
     (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplify the equation from Step 2 to find the relationship between \( S \) and \( B \):
   \[
   S + B + 4 = 28
   \]
   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   S + B = 24
   \]

4. **Substitute \( S \) in Terms of \( B \):**
   Substitute \( S = 2B \) into the simplified equation:
   \[
   2B + B = 24
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   B = \frac{24}{3} = 8
   \]
   So, Brooke is currently 8 years old.

6. **Find Seth's Age:**
   Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
   \[
   S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   Seth is currently 16 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is; Seth is 16 years old.<|im_end|>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

To determine how much money Jimmy has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount of money Ethel has**: Ethel has $8.

2. **Calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has**:
   \[
   2 \times \text{Ethel's money} = 2 \times 8 = 16

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days in a week**:
   - A week has 7 days.

2. **Calculate the number of weekend days**:
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

3. **Calculate the number of weekdays**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week and 2 are weekend days, the remaining days are weekdays.
     \[
     \text{Weekdays} = 7 - 2 = 5

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) in terms of the hat's cost and then find the total cost for all components.

1. **Cost of the Hat:**
   - Let \( H \) represent the cost of the hat.
   - Given: The hat costs $25.
     \[
     H = 25
     \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
     \[
     J = 3H
     \]
   - Substitute \( H \):
     \[
     J = 3 \times 25 = 75
     \]

3. **Cost of the Pants:**
   - The pants' cost is the average of the hat and jacket.
     \[
     P = \frac{H + J}{2}
     \]
   - Substitute \( H \) and \( J \):
     \[
     P = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs from all the different types of creatures Jake sees at the Museum of Entomology.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of spider legs:**
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   \[
   \text{Total spider legs} = 80 \times 8 = 640
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of insect legs:**
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   \[
   \text{Total insect legs} = 90 \times 6 = 540
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of leg-bearing parts (spiders + insects) for the rare, mutant invertebrates:**
   - Jake sees 3 rare, mutant invertebrates.
   - Each invertebrate has 10 legs.
   \[
   \text{Total invertebrate legs} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Add up all the legs together:**
   - Add the legs from the spiders, the insects, and the invertebrates.
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 640 (\text{spiders}) + 540 (\text{insects}) + 30 (\text{invertebrates})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

1. **Determine Sally's current age**:

   Given that Sally is 32 years old and she is equal in age to one of the birds (let's call this bird ""Bird A"").

   \[
   \text{Age of Bird A} = 32
   \]

2. **Calculate Granny Red's age**:

   According to the information given, Granny Red is twice the age of Sally.

   \[
   \text{Age of Granny Red} = 2 \times (\text{Age of Sally}) = 2 \times 32 = 64
   \]

3. **Find out how many birds there are**:

   We know there are 4 birds in total.

4. **Identify which bird is Sally**:

   Since Sally is identified as one of the birds, we can assume that the remaining three birds are either Granny Red or another person.

5. **Verify the number of birds**:

   - If Sally is indeed one of the birds, then the other three must be either Granny Red or someone else.
   - Given that the total number of birds is 4, it confirms that the three additional birds are not Sally.

Therefore, the remaining three birds must be Granny Red.

6. **Calculate the total age of all four birds**:

   Summing up the ages of all four birds gives us:

   \[
   \text{Total Age} = \text{Age of Bird A} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of the third bird} + \text{Age of the fourth bird}
   \]
   
   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total Age} = 32 + 64 + 32 = 128
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:

   The total age of the four birds is 128. 

   Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{128}<|im_end|>","If Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, same as Sally four, their total age 8+8 = <<8+8=16>>16 years.

     90 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 5400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent cutting potatoes**:
   - Each potato takes approximately 5 seconds to cut.
   - For 60 potatoes: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \) seconds.

5. **Add the time spent peeling and cutting**:
   - Time spent peeling: 5400 seconds.
   - Time spent cutting: 300 seconds.
   - Total time: \( 5400 + 300 = 5700 \) seconds.

6. **Convert the total time back to minutes**:
   - To find out how many minutes this is, divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):
     \[
     \frac{5700}{60} = 95 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.<|im_end|>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.

So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                    question:
                    Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 ; for ! lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per ! gallon. , If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on lemons?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total revenue:**
   - Each gallon yields 20 glasses.
   - Each glass sells for $0.50.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10
   \]

2. **Determine cost per gallon:**
   - Cost per gallon includes:
     - Cost of ingredients (lemons + sugar) at $3/gallon.
     - Selling price per gallon ($10).
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost per gallon.
   \[
   C = \frac{\$3}{\text{gallons}} + \frac{\text{cost of lemons + sugar}}{\text{gallons}}
   \]
   - Total cost per gallon must cover both ingredient and selling expenses.

3. **Set up the equation for total cost per gallon:**
   - Let \( L \) be the number of gallons sold.
   - The total cost per gallon is then:
   \[
   C = \left(\frac{L}{\text{gallons}}\right)(\$3 + \$2)
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   C = \left(\frac{L}{\text{gallons}}\right)(\$5)
   \]

4. **Relate total revenue to total cost:**
   - Total revenue from selling 20 glasses per gallon:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10
   \]
   - Total cost should equal total revenue minus profit:
   \[
   C \times L = \$10 - \$25
   \]
   Solving for \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{\$10 - \$25}{L}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Substitute back into the cost equation:
   \[
   C = \left(\frac{L}{\text{gallons}}\right)\( \$5 )
   \]
   - Equating this to the calculated \( C \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{L}{\text{gallons}}\right)\( \$5 ) = \frac{\$10 - \$25}{L}
   \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
   \[
   L(\$5) = (\$10 - \$25)L^{-1}
   \]
   - Simplify:
   \[
   L^2 = 7
   \]
   - Taking the square root of both sides:
   \[
   L = \sqrt{7}
   \]

6. **Find the amount spent on lemons:**
   - Since each gallon costs $3, the total cost per gallon is $3.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on lemons per gallon is:
   \[
   \text{Cost per gallon} = \$3
   \]
   - For \( L = \sqrt{7} \) gallons:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$3 \times \sqrt{7}
   \]

Thus, the amount spent on lemons is:
\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{7}}

   - The total number of Asian participants is given as 240.

2. **Calculate the number of non-Japanese Asians:**
   - We know there are 80 Japanese participants.
   - Therefore, the number of non-Japanese Asians (Chinese) is:
     \[
     240 - 80 = 160
     \]

3. **Identify the number of boys on the Chinese team:**
   - It is given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.

4. **Calculate the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   - Since the total number of Chinese participants is 160, and 60 of them are boys, the remaining must be girls.
   - Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

To solve this problem, let's break down Zaid's monthly income into different categories:

1. **Calculate Rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 6000 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate Car Fuel Cost:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.

   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 6000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Total Expenses (Rent + Car Fuel):**
   Add the rent and car fuel costs together.

   \[
   \text{Total Expenses (Rent + Car Fuel)} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500
   \]

4. **Remaining Amount After Initial Expenses:**
   Subtract the total expenses from his salary.

   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500
   \]

5. **Donate Half of Remaining Amount to Charity:**
   Donate half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.

   \[
   \text{Donation to Charity} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 2500 = 1250
   \]

6. **Amount Left After Donating to Charity:**
   Subtract the donation from the remaining amount.

   \[
   \text{Amount Left After Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
   \]

7. **Zaid’s Daughter’s Expenses:**
   Give his daughter $200.

8. **Zaid’s Wife’s Expenses:**
   Give his wife $700.

9. **Subtract His Daughter’s and Wife’s Expenses:**
   Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining balance.

   \[
   \text{Final Balance} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350
   \]

So, Zaid will still have $\boxed{350}$ dollars left after all these expenses and donations.<|im_end|>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the number of crabs Monica has:**
   - We know that Bo has 40 crabs.
   - According to the problem, Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
     \[
     \text{Number of crabs Monica has} = \text{Number of crabs Bo has} - 4
     \]
     Substituting the value of Bo's crabs:
     \[
     \text{Number of crabs Monica has} = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - The problem states that Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica.
     \[
     \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = \text{Number of crabs Monica has} + 10
     \]
     Substituting the value of Monica's crabs:
     \[
     \text{Number of crabs Rani has} = 36 + 10 = 46
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of crabs:**
   - Now we add up the crabs for Bo, Monica, and Rani.
     \[
     \text{Total number of crabs} = \text{Number of crabs Bo has} + \text{Number of crabs Monica has} + \text{Number of crabs Rani has}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46
     \]

4. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   40 + 36 = 76
   \]
   \[
   76 + 46 = 122
   \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is {122}.<|im_end|>","If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the fraction of votes won:**
   - The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the votes.

2. **Calculate the total number of votes cast:**
   - The total number of students who voted is given as 80.

3. **Find out how many votes the winner actually got:**
   - To find the number of votes the winner got, multiply the total number of votes (80) by the fraction of votes they received (\( \frac{3}{4} \)).

\[
\text{Votes for Winner} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many red roses Fred needs to deliver so that Sandra can avoid switching suppliers. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of white carnations:**
   - According to the information given, Sandra ordered pink calla lilies.
   - The number of pink calla lilies is 200.
   - Pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, let \( x \) be the number of white carnations.
     \[
     200 = 5x
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   So, there are 40 white carnations.

2. **Calculate the number of red roses:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Since there are 40 white carnations:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

3. **Check the remaining items:**
   - We know Sandra ordered pink calla lilies (200).
   - White carnations (40).
   - Red roses (160).

4. **Ensure all orders are correct before proceeding further:**
   - Total flowers: 
     \[
     200 (\text{pink calla lilies}) + 40 (\text{white carnations}) + 160 (\text{red roses}) = 400 \text{ flowers}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers required is 400. Given that Sandra has already placed an order, she will accept only 400 flowers. 

Since Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if these conditions aren't met, Fred must deliver exactly 160 red roses by 5 pm to ensure that Sandra doesn’t switch suppliers. 

Hence, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine Jean's current age based on the information provided about their ages.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( J \) represent Jean's current age.
   Let \( M \) represent Mark's current age.
   Let \( A \) represent Jan's current age.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark (\( J = M + 2 \)).
   - Two years ago, Mark was five years older than half Jan's age (\( M - 2 = \frac{A}{2} + 5 \)).

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   We know that Jan is 30 years old (\( A = 30 \)).

4. **Solve for Mark's Age (M):**
   From the equation \( J = M + 2 \), substitute \( J \):
   \[
   J = M + 2
   \]

   Substitute \( J \) into the second piece of information:
   \[
   M - 2 = \frac{30}{2} + 5
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   M - 2 = 15 + 5
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   M - 2 = 20
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   M = 22
   \]

5. **Find Jean's Age (J):**
   Now that we have Mark’s age (\( M = 22 \)), find Jean's age using \( J = M + 2 \):
   \[
   J = 22 + 2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   J = 24
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, Jean is 24 years old.

\[
\boxed{\text{Jean is 24 years old}}

One of ? the two : teams is very well-rounded and each of their members . will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds.  The other ; team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.  Using this information, how ? many seconds will the faster team win by?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much longer it takes for the slower team to complete its 4:400 meter relay compared to the faster team, we need to calculate the total time taken by both teams.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total time for the faster team**:
   - Each member runs exactly 55 seconds.
   - There are four members on the team.
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time for the slower team**:
   - The first runner runs at 60 seconds.
   - Each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.

   Let's denote the number of runners as \( n \). Since there are 4 runners, \( n = 4 \).

   We can express the time taken by each runner as follows:
   - First runner: 60 seconds
   - Second runner: 60 + 3 = 63 seconds
   - Third runner: 60 + 2 * 3 = 66 seconds
   - Fourth runner: 60 + 3 * 3 = 72 seconds

   Now, sum up all these times:
   
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 60 + 63 + 66 + 72
   \]

   Calculate the sum:
   
   \[
   60 + 63 = 123
   \]
   \[
   123 + 66 = 189
   \]
   \[
   189 + 72 = 261
   \]

   Therefore, the total time for the slower team is 261 seconds.

### Final Answer:
The faster team wins by 41 seconds (since \( 220 - 261 = -41 \) but since it’s negative, the faster team loses by 41 seconds).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-41}
\]<|im_end|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                    question:
                    Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. How much ! more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) that . he rolls a number greater ? than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many favorable outcomes there are for both scenarios and then calculate the probability.

### Step 1: Calculate the total possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die.
A six-sided die has 6 faces, so there are 6 possible outcomes when rolled once:

\[ \text{Total outcomes} = 6 \]

### Step 2: Determine the favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3.
Numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 such outcomes:

\[ \text{Favorable outcomes for > 3} = 3 \]

### Step 3: Determine the favorable outcomes for rolling two even numbers in a row.
Even numbers on a six-sided die are 2 and 4. The only way to roll two even numbers in a row is to roll a 2 followed by another 2. There is only one such outcome:

\[ \text{Favorable outcomes for two even numbers in a row} = 1 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.
Probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \):

\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.
Probability \( P(\text{two even numbers}) \):

\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

### Step 6: Find how much more likely the first scenario is compared to the second.
We use the formula for likelihood ratio:

\[
\text{Likelihood Ratio} = \frac{P(\text{number} > 3)}{P(\text{two even numbers})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{6}}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\text{Likelihood Ratio} = \frac{1/2}{1/6} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{6}{1} \right) = 3
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(3\) times more likely.<|im_end|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

   - Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.
   - Her mom picked 20 apples.

   Therefore,
   \[

2. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both:**
   - Jenna picked 10 apples.
   - Her mom also picked 20 apples.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the total amount of straw distributed.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of rats:**
   - We know that there are 160 pieces of straw distributed among the rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   
   Let \( n \) be the number of rats.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   n = \frac{160}{6} = 26.\overline{6}
   \]
   Since the number of rats must be an integer, let’s round down because partial rats don’t make sense here (they can only be whole animals).
   
   So, there are 26 rats.

2. **Determine the number of cages for the rats:**
   - There are 10 cages for rats.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Number of cages per rat} = \frac{10}{26}
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   \text{Number of cages per rat} = \frac{10}{26} = \frac{5}{13}
   \]
   This fraction indicates that the distribution isn't possible as it results in a non-integer value. However, if we assume perfect division without remainder, we might consider rounding or re-evaluating the problem constraints. But since the problem states ""equal groups,"" let's proceed with the exact calculation.

3. **Verify the total number of straw:**
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
   - With 26 rats, the total straw would be:
     \[
     26 \times 6 = 160
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions provided, the correct interpretation should involve the exact distribution ensuring no straw is wasted elsewhere and all calculations align perfectly.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{There is 1 rat in each cage}}
\]<|im_end|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Mandy owes Benedict $100. ; They agreed to have monthly interest of 2%. If Mandy was able to pay it after 3 , months, how much should she give to Benedict?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed including the accrued interest over this period.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Monthly Interest:**
   - The annual interest rate is 2%, so the monthly interest rate is \( \frac{2\%}{12} = \frac{2}{1200} = \frac{1}{600} \) or approximately 0.00167 (or 0.167%).

2. **Total Amount Owed Over 3 Months:**
   - For each month, the interest accumulates on the principal plus any previously accumulated interest.
   - Let's denote the initial amount as \( P \), which is $100 in this case.

3. **Interest Calculation for Each Month:**
   - After the first month, the amount becomes \( P + P \times \text{monthly interest} \).
   - After the second month, the new amount is \( (P + P \times \text{monthly interest}) + (P + P \times \text{monthly interest}) \times \text{monthly interest} \).
   - After the third month, the amount will be even more due to compounding.

4. **Summing Up the Principal and Accumulated Interest:**
   - We can simplify the calculation using the formula for compound interest:
     \[
     A = P(1 + r)^n
     \]
     where \( A \) is the amount after \( n \) periods, \( P \) is the principal, \( r \) is the interest rate per period, and \( n \) is the number of periods.

5. **Applying the Formula:**
   - Here, \( P = 100 \), \( r = 0.00167 \), and \( n = 3 \).

### Calculations:

Using the formula:
\[ A = 100 \left(1 + 0.00167\right)^3 \]

First, compute the base factor:
\[ 1 + 0.00167 = 1.00167 \]

Now raise this to the power of 3:
\[ 1.00167^3 \approx 1.00503 \]

Finally, multiply by the principal:
\[ A = 100 \times 1.00503 \approx 100.503 \]

So, after 3 months, Mandy would owe approximately $100.50 to Benedict.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
The amount Mandy should give to Benedict is $\boxed{100.50}$.<|im_end|>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost for transporting all the bags:**
   - The cost to transport one bag is $2.
   - Let's assume the trader bought \( x \) bags of wheat.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost is \( 2x \).

2. **Determine the revenue from selling all the bags:**
   - The price at which each bag is sold is $30.
   - So, if the trader sells all \( x \) bags, his total revenue would be \( 30x \).

3. **Identify the profit equation:**
   - Profit = Revenue - Cost
   - Given that the trader made a total profit of $400, we can write:
     \[
     30x - (20 + 2x) = 400
     \]
     Here, \( 20 \) represents the buying price per bag, and \( 2x \) represents the transportation cost.

4. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     30x - 2x = 400 \\
     28x = 400
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 28:
     \[
     x = \frac{400}{28} \\
     x = 14.2857
     \]

Since the number of bags must be an integer, let's round down to the nearest whole number because you can't sell a fraction of a bag in practical terms.

So, the trader sold approximately 14 bags of wheat.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total expenses incurred by the three friends and then divide that amount by the number of people.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the tickets:**
   - Each friend spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
   - Total cost for one ticket = $\frac{20.25}{3}$
   - Total cost for all tickets = $(\text{cost per ticket}) \times (number of tickets)$

   Let's perform these calculations:

   - Cost per ticket = $\frac{20.25}{3} = 6.75$
   - Total cost for all tickets = $6.75 \times 3 = 20.25$

2. **Calculate the cost of the food:**
   - The cost of food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets.
   - Food cost = Ticket cost - $4.50

   Performing the calculation:

   - Food cost = $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25$

3. **Calculate the total cost including food:**
   - Total cost = Ticket cost + Food cost

   Performing the calculation:

   - Total cost = $20.25 + $2.25 = $22.50$

4. **Calculate the total cost of rides:**
   - Each person rode twice (once for the fair and once more).
   - Total cost for rides = Number of rides × Cost per ride

   Since there are two rides per person and each ride costs $33:

   - Total cost for rides = $33 \times 2 \times (number of people) = $66 \times (number of people)$

   Given that the total cost for rides must be covered by the remaining money after paying for tickets and food, let's denote the number of people as \( n \).

   Therefore, the total cost of rides can be written as:

   - Total cost of rides = $66n$

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - Total cost = Tickets + Food + Rides
   - $22.50 = 20.25 + 2.25 + 66n$

6. **Solve for \( n \):**

   - Combine like terms on the right side of the equation:

     $22.50 = 22.50 + 66n$

   - Subtract 22.50 from both sides:

     $0 = 66n$

   - Divide both sides by 66:

     $n = \frac{0}{66}$

   - Simplify:

     $n = 0$

This result indicates that it is not possible for the three friends to split the costs evenly given the provided numbers, because no one paid any money at all.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is} None of the above. The friends cannot split the costs evenly under the given conditions.<|im_end|>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.

They spent a total of $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
So each of them paid $102/3 = $<<102/3=34>>34.

   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - There are 10 ducks in the flock.

2. **Calculate the total weekly insect consumption:**
   \[
   \text{Total weekly consumption} = \text{Number of ducks} \times \text{Insect consumption per duck per week}

   \[
   \text{Total weekly consumption} = 10 \times 3.5 = 35 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Convert the total weekly consumption from weeks to days:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - To find out how much is consumed per day, we divide the total weekly consumption by 7.
   
4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = \frac{\text{Total weekly consumption}}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = \frac{35}{7} = 5 \text{ pounds per day}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the net number of trees added or removed in one year**

Tom adds 10 trees per year but loses 2 trees per year.

Net change in trees per year = Trees added - Trees lost
= 10 - 2
= 8 trees

So, every year, Tom's total tree count changes by +8 trees (if he grows more than loses).

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees after 10 years without considering the 30% loss**

If Tom continues growing for 10 years at a rate of 8 trees per year, then over 10 years he will add:

Total trees added over 10 years = Net change per year * Number of years
= 8 trees/year * 10 years
= 80 trees

Adding these to his starting number gives us:

Total trees after 10 years before any loss = Starting number + Total trees added
= 50 trees + 80 trees
= 130 trees

**Step 3: Adjust for the 30% loss after 10 years**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, we calculate 70% of the remaining trees:

Number of trees after 10 years = Initial number * 70%
= 130 trees * 70/100
= 91 trees

Therefore, after accounting for the 30% loss, Tom has **91 trees left**.

{The final answer is} 91 trees.<|im_end|>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year
After 10 years he has 8*10=<<8*10=80>>80 new trees
So he had 80+50=<<80+50=130>>130 trees
He lost 130*.3=<<130*.3=39>>39 trees
That means he had 130-39=<<130-39=91>>91 trees

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to track the number of pink and white flamingos over time as described.

1. **Initial Placement:**
   - **Friday:** The neighbors place 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   
2. **First Removal and Replacement:**
   - **Saturday:** They take back one-third of the flamingos.
     - Calculate one-third of 18:
       \[
       \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
       \]
     - Remove 6 flamingos from the collection.
     - Replace the removed flamingos with 18 new ones.
   
3. **Final Count After Replacement:**
   - Start with 18 pink flamingos (initial count).
   - Subtract 6 (removed):
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - Add 18 (replaced):
     \[
     12 + 18 = 30
     \]

4. **Second Addition:**
   - **Sunday:** The neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos.
   
5. **Counting Total Flamingos at Noon on Sunday:**
   - Start with the total after the second addition:
     \[
     30 \text{ pink flamingos}
     \]
   - Add another 18 pink flamingos:
     \[
     30 + 18 = 48
     \]

6. **Calculating the Difference Between Pink and White Flamingos:**
   - Number of pink flamingos at noon on Sunday: 48.
   - Number of white flamingos at noon on Sunday: 18.
   - Calculate the difference:
     \[
     48 - 18 = 30
     \]

**Conclusion:**

At noon on Sunday, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos. Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{30}<|im_end|>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

To determine how much change Violetta will get after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of one crayon:**
   Each crayon costs $2.

2. **Determine the number of different colors Violetta wants to buy:**
   Violetta wants to buy 5 different colors.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all the crayons she wants to buy:**
   Since each crayon costs $2 and she wants 5 crayons, we multiply the cost per crayon by the number of crayons.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10
   \]

4. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has (prepared):**
   Violetta has $20 initially.
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of one pen.
Given that a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.

- Cost of one pencil = $1.20
- Cost of one eraser = $0.30

Cost of one pen (P) = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
\[ P = 1.20 + 0.30 \]
\[ P = 1.50 \]

So, one pen costs $1.50.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 8 pens.
Now we need to find out how much 8 pens would cost.

Total cost for 8 pens = 8 × Cost of one pen
\[ Total\ cost = 8 \times 1.50 \]
\[ Total\ cost = 12.00 \]

Therefore, 8 pens together would cost $12.00.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} The total cost for 8 pens is $12.00.<|im_end|>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings**: Since there are 40 restaurants and each receives 2 pounds of carrots, we can find out the total amount of carrots distributed.

   \[
   \text{Total servings} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Weight per serving}}
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Total servings} = \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/restaurant}} = 100 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine the unused carrot quantity**: We know that the total distribution should equal the total available carrots (200 pounds). Therefore, we subtract the total servings from the total weight to find the leftover carrots.

   \[
   \text{Unused carrots} = \text{Total weight} - (\text{Total servings} \times \text{Weight per serving})
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Unused carrots} = 200 \text{ pounds} - (100 \text{ servings} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant}) = 200 \text{ pounds} - 200 \text{ pounds} = 0 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 0 pounds of carrots will not be used.<|im_end|>","The restaurants need 40 * 2 = <<40*2=80>>80 lbs. of carrots.

2. **Number of Men and Women Calculation**:
   - There are 8417 men and 9092 women.
   
3. **Sum of Men and Women**:
   - Add the number of men and women together to find out how many adults (men + women) live in Soda.

2. Determine how many cards she collected in the second month.
3. Find out how many cards she collected in the third month.
4. Sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months.

Let's go through each step carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cards collected in the first month
Elaine initially had 20 cards. She collected three times that number after a month.

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

So, she collected 60 cards in the first month.

### Step 2: Determine the number of cards collected in the second month
In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.

\[
60 - 20 = 40
\]

So, she collected 40 cards in the second month.

### Step 3: Find out the number of cards collected in the third month
In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.

First, find the combined number of cards from the first and second months:

\[
60 + 40 = 100
\]

Then, collect twice this amount:

\[
100 \times 2 = 200
\]

So, she collected 200 cards in the third month.

### Step 4: Sum up all the cards collected over the three months
Now, add up all the cards she has collected:

\[
20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month)
\]

\[
= 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320
\]

Therefore, Elaine has a total of **320** Pokémon cards now.<|im_end|>","In the first month, Elaine collected 3*20= <<3*20=60>>60 pokemon cards.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher.
2. Calculate his earnings from Publisher A.
3. Calculate his earnings from Publisher B (which is twice as much as Publisher A).
4. Sum up his earnings from both publishers.

Step 1: Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences from each publisher, he edits half of the total sentences.

Total sentences = 1000
Half of the sentences = \( \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \) sentences

Step 2: Calculate Mark's earnings from Publisher A.

Publisher A pays $0.05 per sentence.
Earnings from Publisher A = \( 500 \times 0.05 = 25 \) dollars

Step 3: Calculate Mark's earnings from Publisher B.

Since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, it will pay \( 2 \times 0.05 = 0.10 \) dollars per sentence.
Earnings from Publisher B = \( 500 \times 0.10 = 50 \) dollars

Step 4: Sum up his earnings from both publishers.

Total earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B
Total earnings = \( 25 + 50 = 75 \) dollars

Therefore, Mark makes a total of **$75** in a week.<|im_end|>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

4. **Determine the volume of water per pail:**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   
5. **Calculate the total volume of water consumed in one day:**

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate both the one-time monetary reward from the award and the total increase in his salary over the course of the year.

### Step 1: Calculate the one-time monetary reward
John wins a $5000 award.
\[ \text{Monetary Reward} = \$5000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the annual salary increase
John's current weekly salary is $2000 per week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
First, find out what his weekly salary would be if he had been working for the entire year without any raises.
\[ \text{Annual Salary Without Raises} = \$2000 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary Without Raises} = \$104,000 \]

Next, calculate the amount of raise based on the 5% raise rate.
\[ \text{Raise Amount} = \$104,000 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Raise Amount} = \$5,200 \]

Now, add this raise to his current weekly salary to get his new weekly salary after the raise.
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary After Raise} = \$2000 + \$5,200 \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary After Raise} = \$7,200 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total additional money earned due to the raise
Multiply the new weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year (52) to find out how much more money John earns each week because of the raise.
\[ \text{Additional Money Per Week Due To Raise} = \$7,200 \]
\[ \text{Total Additional Money Over Year} = \$7,200 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total Additional Money Over Year} = \$376,400 \]

### Step 4: Add the monetary award to the total additional money earned
Finally, sum up the one-time monetary award and the total additional money earned over the year.
\[ \text{Total Money Earned That Year} = \$5000 + \$376,400 \]
\[ \text{Total Money Earned That Year} = \$381,400 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{\$381,400}$.<|im_end|>","He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year

                    question:
                    Josie grows grapes on her 10-acre farm.  Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, and each ? ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine.  How , many barrels of wine does her farm . produce per year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm can produce in a year, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tons of grapes produced annually**

- Josie has an 10-acre farm.
- Each acre yields 5 tons of grapes.

\[
\text{Total tons of grapes} = \text{Number of acres} \times \text{Grapes per acre}
\]

\[
\text{Total tons of grapes} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ tons}
\]

**Step 2: Convert tons of grapes into barrels of wine**

- Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine.

\[
\text{Barrels of wine from grapes} = \text{Tons of grapes} \times \text{Barrels per ton}
\]

\[
\text{Barrels of wine from grapes} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ barrels}
\]

**Step 3: Verify the calculation**

Let's verify if our calculations align correctly:

- If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and there are 10 acres,
  
\[
5 \text{ tons/acre} \times 10 \text{ acres} = 50 \text{ tons}
\]

- Each ton of grapes converts to 2 barrels,

\[
2 \text{ barrels/ton} \times 50 \text{ tons} = 100 \text{ barrels}
\]

Both methods confirm that Josie's farm will produce 100 barrels of wine per year.

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{\text{100 barrels}}
\]<|im_end|>","If each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, then her ten-acre farm produces 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 tons of grapes per year.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down Carl's daily cheese consumption into parts:

1. **Sandwiches:**
   - Carl eats a sandwich every day.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.

   Since there are 7 days in a week:
   \[
   2 \text{ slices/sandwich} \times 7 \text{ sandwiches/day} = 14 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Cheese and Egg Omelets:**
   - Carl makes 3 omelets for breakfast.
   - The number of slices used increases by 1 compared to the number of omelets eaten.

   Let \( n \) be the total number of omelets eaten over the week (including breakfast):
   - For breakfast alone, \( n = 3 \).

   Therefore, the total number of slices used from these omelets would be:
   \[
   2 \text{ slices/omelet} \times n = 2n
   \]
   Substituting \( n = 3 \):
   \[
   2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasts him several dinners.
   - This dish uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, summing up all the slices of cheese used:
\[
14 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 6 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 28 \text{ slices}
\]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]<|im_end|>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

### Step 3: Add up all the pens.
- Green pens: 22
- Blue pens: 54
- Red pens: 12

\[

                    question:
                    Brinley is in ? Mr. Bert's ! math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the current average after removing the lowest score:**
   - Brinley's scores for the first five tests are: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
   - The lowest score among these is 71.
   - To find the average after removing the lowest score, we sum all the scores and then divide by four (since there are five scores).

2. **Sum the scores and subtract the lowest score:**
   \[
   \text{Sum of scores} = 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average without the lowest score} = \frac{438}{5} = 87.6
   \]

3. **Find the total score needed to achieve an average of 93:**
   - An average of 93 means that when you add up all the scores and divide by the number of scores (which is now three because one score was removed), you should get 93.
   - Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test.
   - We set up the equation based on the desired average:
     \[
     \frac{(438 + x)}{6} = 93
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   438 + x = 93 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   438 + x = 558
   \]
   \[
   x = 558 - 438
   \]
   \[
   x = 120
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 120 on her sixth test to have an average of 93.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 120.<|im_end|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many kilometers Michael rode his bike over the two periods, we need to break down the information provided into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Michael rides per day when he rides at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rides at least 5 times a week, he rides for 4 weeks.
- He rides a total of \(25 \text{ km} \times 4 = 100 \text{ km}\) in those 4 weeks.
- Since he does this every week, he rides \(100 \text{ km/week} \times 7 \text{ weeks} = 700 \text{ km}\) in one full month (assuming 4 weeks).

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Michael rides per day when he rides exactly 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time.
- He rides 2 times a week, so he rides for \(60 \text{ km} \times 2 = 120 \text{ km}\) in those 2 weeks.
- Since he does this every week, he rides \(120 \text{ km/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ km}\) in one full month.

### Step 3: Determine the number of days in one full month.
Assuming a standard month has approximately 30 or 31 days, let's use 30 days for calculation purposes.

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance Michael rides in one full month.
- For the first period where he rides at least 5 times a week, he rides \(700 \text{ km}\).
- For the second period where he rides exactly 2 times a week, he rides \(480 \text{ km}\).
- The total distance he rides in one full month is \(700 \text{ km} + 480 \text{ km} = 1180 \text{ km}\).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1180}
\]<|im_end|>","In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.

After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the weight of each chocolate bar:**
   - We're given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

2. **Calculate the total weight of all chocolate bars:**
   - Joe's bag contains 25 chocolate bars.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars = \( 25 \times 40 \) grams.

3. **Calculate the total weight of all candied apples:**
   - Joe's bag contains 80 candied apples.
   - Since we know the weight of one chocolate bar (which is also equal to the weight of one candied apple), we can use this information to find the total weight of the candied apples.

4. **Sum up the weights of the chocolate bars and candied apples:**
   - Let's calculate these totals separately first before adding them together.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

**Chocolate Bars:**
\[ 25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ grams per chocolate bar} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

**Candied Apples:**
Since each chocolate bar equals each candied apple,
\[ 80 \text{ candied apples} \times 40 \text{ grams per candied apple} = 3200 \text{ grams} \]

### Final Total Weight Calculation:

\[ 1000 \text{ grams from chocolate bars} + 3200 \text{ grams from candied apples} = 4200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \(\boxed{4200}\) grams.<|im_end|>","The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cakes Rose bought over the course of the three days. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the number of cakes Rose bought on Monday:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday.
   
2. **Calculate the number of cakes Rose bought on Tuesday:**
   - According to the problem, Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Tuesday = \(3 \times 4\).

Let's perform the multiplication for Tuesday:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Rose bought 12 cakes on Tuesday.

3. **Calculate the number of cakes Rose bought on Wednesday:**
   - Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Therefore, the number of cakes bought on Wednesday = \(5 \times 12\).

Let's perform the multiplication for Wednesday:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \]

So, Rose bought 60 cakes on Wednesday.

4. **Sum up the total number of cakes bought over the three days:**

Now, let's add up the cakes from each day:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total number of cakes = \(4 + 12 + 60\)

Performing the addition:

                    question:
                    Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates : sold at $6000 each. Calculate ? the total cost of buying each cup.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the total cost of one cup.

2. **Convert the given information into equations:**
   - The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
     - Half a dozen plates means 6 plates, so the total cost for half a dozen plates is \( 6C \).
     - Twenty dozen cups can be converted to dozens as follows: 
       \[
       \text{Total number of cups} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ cups}
       \]
       Thus, the total cost of 240 cups is \( 240C \).

3. **Set up the equation based on the given condition:**
   According to the problem, the cost of 240 cups ($1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates):
   \[
   240C = (6C - 1200)
   \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   Start solving the equation from the right side:
   \[
   240C + 1200 = 6C
   \]
   Subtract \( 6C \) from both sides:
   \[
   240C - 6C + 1200 = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   234C + 1200 = 0
   \]
   Subtract 1200 from both sides:
   \[
   234C = -1200
   \]
   Divide both sides by 234:
   \[
   C = \frac{-1200}{234} = -\frac{1200}{234} = -5.130434782608695 \approx -5.13
   \]

Since the negative value doesn't make sense in this context, it seems there might have been an error or misinterpretation. Let's recheck our setup and calculations:

- Correctly, the equation should be:
  \[
  240C = 6C - 1200
  \]
  Substituting back correctly:
  \[
  240C = 6C - 1200
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  240C + 1200 = 6C
  \]
  Solving again:
  \[
  234C = -1200
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 234:
  \[
  C = \frac{-1200}{234} = -5.13
  \]

This still leads to an incorrect interpretation due to the negative value. Rechecking shows the correct approach should be:
\[ 
240C = 6C - 1200 \\
234C = -1200 \\
C = \frac{-1200}{234} = -5.13
\]

Re-evaluating gives:
\[
240C = 6C - 1200 \\
234C = -1200 \\
C = \frac{-1200}{234} = -5.13
\]

Total earnings from babysitting: \( 5x \)

### Step 3: Determine how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn.
Sara earns $4 per session mowing the lawn. Let \( y \) be the number of sessions she needs to mow the lawn.

Total earnings from mowing the lawn: \( 4y \)

### Step 4: Set up an equation to find out when the total savings equal or exceed the total cost.
The total amount Sara saves after working as a babysitter should cover the cost of the jacket and two pairs of shoes. This means we need to solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \).

From the equation:

\[ 5x + 4y = 70 \]

Since we know that Sara already has $10 saved, her total savings will be:

\[ S = 10 + 5x + 4y \]

We want this sum to be at least $70, so:

\[ 10 + 5x + 4y \geq 70 \]
\[ 5x + 4y \geq 60 \]

Now, substitute back into our original equation:

\[ 5x + 4y = 70 \]

### Step 5: Solve the system of equations.
Let’s isolate one variable first. We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ 4y = 70 - 5x \]
\[ y = \frac{70 - 5x}{4} \]

Substitute \( y \) back into the original equation:

\[ 5x + 4\left(\frac{70 - 5x}{4}\right) = 70 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x + 70 - 5x = 70 \]
\[ 70 = 70 \]

This confirms our setup is correct but doesn’t give us specific values yet. We need to find integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) such that both equations hold true. 

### Step 6: Find suitable values for \( x \) and \( y \).
Let's try different values for \( x \):

If \( x = 8 \):
\[ 5(8) + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 40 + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 4y = 30 \]
\[ y = 7.5 \] (Not possible since \( y \) must be an integer)

If \( x = 9 \):
\[ 5(9) + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 45 + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 4y = 25 \]
\[ y = 6.25 \] (Not possible since \( y \) must be an integer)

If \( x = 10 \):
\[ 5(10) + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 50 + 4y = 70 \]
\[ 4y = 20 \]
\[ y = 5 \]

Thus, if \( x = 10 \), then \( y = 5 \).

### Final Answer:
Sara needs to work **10 times** as a babysitter and **5 times** mowing the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes. Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 10 times babysitting and 5 times mowing the lawn.<|im_end|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

                    question:
                    , Jerry has a flock of chickens. The red ; chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every . day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens : than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) represent the number of white chickens.

### Step 2: Establish Relationships Based on Information Provided
We know that every day:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs per chicken.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs per chicken.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs per day.

This gives us the equation for total eggs collected per day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Additionally, we're told that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This relationship can be expressed as:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

### Step 3: Substitute the Relationship into the Total Eggs Equation
Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the first equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \)
Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( r \):
\[ 8r = 32 \]
Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

### Conclusion
Jerry has **4** red chickens.<|im_end|>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

                    Gary likes to walk around the edge of the . local park, . which is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he ! walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Gary spends walking around the perimeter of the rectangular park. Here's our step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the park**
- The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles (length) and 6 miles (width).
- Perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Gary needs to walk is 15 miles.

**Step 2: Determine the time spent walking**
- Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
- Time \( T \) can be calculated using the formula:
\[ T = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Substitute the values for distance and speed:
\[ T = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ T = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends **5 hours** walking around the park.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, let's break down the information provided:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is \(100 + 50 = 150\).
3. The total number of customers over the three days is given as 500.

Now, to find out how many customers were counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total for all three days.

Let's calculate it step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of customers on the third day.
Since the total for the three days is 500 and the first two days combined are 100 (first day) + 150 (second day), the third day would be \(500 - (100 + 150)\).

Step 2: Perform the subtraction.
\(500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250\)

Therefore, the number of customers counted on the third day is 250.

{The final answer is} 250<|im_end|>","On the second day, she counted 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 customers.

                    question:
                    Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them . out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water ? as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How ? much water does the small pool ; have : now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water is currently in the smaller pool. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool.
   - The large pool initially has \( 2S \) (twice as much as the small pool).

2. **Time Information:**
   - Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.

3. **Current Time Calculation:**
   - 4 minutes ago, the small pool had \( S \).
   - At that time, the large pool had \( 2S \).

4. **Water Remaining:**
   - Since they've been leaking for 4 minutes, the total water lost from both pools over 4 minutes is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

5. **Amount of Water Left in Each Pool:**
   - After 4 minutes, the small pool would have \( S - 16 \) gallons left.
   - The large pool would have \( 2S - 16 \) gallons left.

6. **Current Conditions:**
   - Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool.
   - Therefore, \( 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \).

7. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
   \]

8. **Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S - 64
   \]
   Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
   \[
   -16 = 2S - 64
   \]
   Add 64 to both sides:
   \[
   48 = 2S
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   S = 24
   \]

Therefore, the small pool currently has 24 gallons of water.<|im_end|>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16

To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford both the shoes and the belt, let's break this down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - The shoes cost $320.00.
   - The belt costs $32.00.
   
   Adding these together gives us:
   \[
   320 + 32 = 352
   \]
   So, the total cost for both items is $352.

2. **Determine how much more money Lori needs to earn:**
   - Lori has saved $8.00 from her part-time job.
   - To find out how much more she needs, we subtract her savings from the total cost:
   \[
   352 - 8 = 344
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to earn the additional amount:**
   - Lori earns $8.00 per hour.
   - To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the remaining amount needed by her hourly wage:
   \[
   \frac{344}{8} = 43
   \]

Therefore, Lori will need to work $\boxed{43}$ hours before she can afford both the shoes and the belt.<|im_end|>","She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Janeth's remaining balance after her loan repayment period, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount to be repaid**
Janeth is promised to return the principal plus an additional 10% of the amount.

Principal = $2000

Additional interest = Principal * Additional Interest Rate
= $2000 * 10%
= $2000 * 0.10
= $200

Total amount to be repaid = Principal + Additional Interest
= $2000 + $200
= $2200

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment over the course of 12 months**
Monthly Payment = Total Amount to be Repaid / Number of Months
= $2200 / 12
≈ $183.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

**Step 3: Determine the total amount paid over the 12 months**
Total Paid Over 12 Months = Monthly Payment * Number of Months
= $183.33 * 12
≈ $2200 (since $183.33 rounds up to $2200)

**Step 4: Subtract the total amount paid from the original amount borrowed**
Remaining Balance After 12 Months = Original Loan Amount - Total Amount Paid
= $2000 - $2200
= -$200

**Conclusion**
Since the result is negative, Janeth has already paid more than she borrowed. Therefore, her remaining balance is **-$200**, indicating that she still owes $200. This means she needs to borrow another $200 to cover the outstanding debt.<|im_end|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

Step 1: Determine Harriet's current age.
Harriet is currently 21 years old.

Step 2: Determine Adrian's current age based on Harriet's age.
Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age = 3 * 21 = 63 years old.

Step 3: Determine Zack's current age based on Harriet's age.
Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Step 4: Calculate the ages of all three after three years.
- Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
- Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
- Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.

Step 5: Calculate the total sum of their ages after three years.
Total sum = 24 (Harriet) + 66 (Adrian) + 45 (Zack) = 135.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each student scored based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Determine points scored by Naomi
Naomi's score is given directly as 68 points.

\[ \text{Naomi's Score} = 68 \]

### Step 2: Calculate points scored by Yuri
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.

First, calculate half of Naomi's score:

\[ \frac{\text{Naomi's Score}}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \]

Then add 10 to this value to get Yuri's score:

\[ \text{Yuri's Score} = 34 + 10 = 44 \]

### Step 3: Calculate points scored by Brianna
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

\[ \text{Brianna's Score} = \text{Naomi's Score} + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85 \]

### Step 4: Calculate total points scored by all four students
We know the total points scored by all four students together is 251.

Let \( J \) represent the number of points scored by Jojo.

\[
J + 68 + 44 + 85 = 251
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( J \)
Combine like terms:

\[
J + (68 + 44 + 85) = 251
\]
\[
J + 197 = 251

                    question:
                    It ? takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle and 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle.  Over the weekend she solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles.  How much , time did she spend ! playing . these games?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Carmen spent on both crossword puzzles and Sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

**Step 1: Calculate the time spent on crosswords**
- Time per crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles solved = 3

\[
\text{Total time for crosswords} = \text{Time per crossword puzzle} \times \text{Number of crosswords}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for crosswords} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for crosswords} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time spent on Sudoku**
- Time per Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles solved = 8

\[
\text{Total time for Sudoku} = \text{Time per Sudoku puzzle} \times \text{Number of Sudoku puzzles}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for Sudoku} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles}
\]

\[
\text{Total time for Sudoku} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Sum up the total time spent**

\[
\text{Total time spent} = \text{Total time for crosswords} + \text{Total time for Sudoku}
\]

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{70 \text{ minutes}}

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much water remains after Celine uses some for her garden.
Initially, the tank contains 120 liters of water.

Celine uses 90 liters for her garden. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the amount she used from the total amount in the tank:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine uses some for her garden.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
According to the problem, the collected rainwater is twice as much as what was left in the tank.

Since there were 30 liters left in the tank before collecting rainwater, the amount of rainwater collected would be:

\[ \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Find the new total amount of water in the tank.
After collecting the rainwater, the total amount of water in the tank becomes the sum of the remaining water and the collected rainwater:

\[ \text{New total amount of water} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**.<|im_end|>","After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.
Celine was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.
Thus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many petunias Andy plants.
2. Calculate the total number of flowers planted.

Step 1: Determine the number of petunias Andy plants.
Andy has 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. Since he has 90 geraniums, we can find the number of petunias by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums.

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers planted.
Now that we know Andy has 90 geraniums and 50 petunias, we can add them together to get the total number of flowers.

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.<|im_end|>","First find the number of petunias Andy plants: 90 flowers - 40 = <<90-40=50>>50 flowers

To find out how much the company spent in total on advertising over the two years, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the spending on the second year**

- The first year's spending was $15000.
- For the second year, they spend a third of what they did in the first year.

\[
\text{Second Year Spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15000

So, the second year's spending is $5000.

**Step 2: Add the spending from both years together**

\[
\text{Total Spent} = \$15000 + \$5000

2. **Calculate Benji's total cost:**
   - Benji rents the banana boat (raft) for $18 per hour.
   - He uses the banana boat for 5 hours.

   \[
   \text{Benji's cost} = \$18 \times 5 = \$90

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of days for the journey from New Jersey to Rochester:**
   - We know that it takes 6 days to travel by bus.
   - The journey by car is half as long as the bus journey.
   
   \[
   \text{Days by car} = \frac{\text{Days by bus}}{2}
   \]
   
   Substituting the given value:

   \[
   \text{Days by car} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days for the round trip (bus + car):**
   - He travels from New Jersey to Rochester by bus and back by car.
   
   \[
   \text{Total days} = (\text{Days by bus}) + (\text{Days by car})

<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of cards before any changes**

James initially has three types of Pokémon cards:
- Fire-type: 30
- Grass-type: 20
- Water-type: 40

Total initial number of cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90

**Step 2: Adjust for the losses and purchases**

James loses 8 water-type cards.
He then buys 14 grass-type cards.

**Step 3: Calculate the new total number of cards after adjustments**

New number of water-type cards = Initial water-type cards - Lost water-type cards = 40 - 8 = 32

Number of grass-type cards remains unchanged at 20.

So, the new total number of cards = New water-type cards + Number of grass-type cards = 32 + 20 = 52

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage chance of picking a water-type card**

We now have 52 cards in total, out of which 32 are water-type.

Percentage chance of picking a water-type card = (Number of water-type cards / Total number of cards) * 100

Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost without upgrades
Chad orders a base burrito for $6.50.

### Step 2: Add additional costs based on choices
Chad adds extra meat for $2.00.
Chad adds extra cheese for $1.00.
Chad adds avocado for $1.00.
Chad also adds two sauces for $0.25 each (total = $0.25 × 2 = $0.50).

Adding these up:
\[ \text{Total from choices} = \$2.00 + \$1.00 + \$1.00 + \$0.50 = \$4.50 \]

### Step 3: Add the upgrade fee
Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00.

### Step 4: Total before applying the gift card
Now let's sum everything together:
\[ \text{Total before gift card} = \$6.50 + \$4.50 + \$3.00 = \$14.00 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the value of the gift card
Chad uses a gift card worth $5.00.

### Final calculation
Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total amount owed gives us:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle together.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda adds pieces:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of minutes required for Kalinda to complete the puzzle:**
   - Since there are 360 pieces in the puzzle, and Kalinda adds 4 pieces per minute, the time (in minutes) she needs to complete the puzzle is:
     \[
     \text{Time for Kalinda} = \frac{360}{4} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda's mom places pieces:**
   - Kalinda’s mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, her mom's placement rate is:
     \[
     \text{Placement rate for mom} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]
     
4. **Calculate the total number of minutes required for their combined effort to complete the puzzle:**
   - Together, they will add \(4\) pieces from Kalinda plus \(2\) pieces from her mom, making it \(6\) pieces added per minute.
   - The time (in minutes) it takes for both to complete the puzzle together is:
     \[
     \text{Combined time} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert the combined time into hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{60}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

### Final Answer:

4. Determine how many watermelons remained unharvested after her second visit.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest initially
- Total watermelons = 120
- Percentage ready for harvest = 30%

Number of watermelons ready for harvest initially:
\[ \text{Watermelons ready} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} = 120 \times 0.3 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of watermelons remaining unharvested after Ashlyn's first visit
- Watermelons remaining after the first visit:
\[ \text{Watermelons remaining} = 120 - 36 = 84 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest again during her second visit
- Fraction of remaining watermelons ready for harvest = \( \frac{3}{4} \)

Number of watermelons ready for harvest again:
\[ \text{Watermelons ready again} = 84 \times \frac{3}{4} = 84 \times 0.75 = 63 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of watermelons remaining unharvested after her second visit
- Watermelons remaining after the second visit:
\[ \text{Watermelons remaining} = 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is **21**.<|im_end|>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars without taxes or fees**

Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars, and each car sells for $20,000.
\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times \$20,000 = \$240,000
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the tax on the cars**

Mark has to pay 10% tax on the cars.
\[
\text{Tax amount} = 10\% \times \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the registration fee for all cars**

He also has to pay an additional $1,000 per car for registration.
\[
\text{Registration fee} = 12 \times \$1,000 = \$12,000
\]

**Step 4: Sum up all costs**

Now, we add up the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fee.
\[
\text{Total payment} = \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000
\]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is $\boxed{\$276,000}$.<|im_end|>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000
So the tax came out to 240,000*.1=$<<240000*.1=24000>>24,000
So the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000
Registration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of penguins:**
   We know there are 36 penguins.

2. **Calculate how many penguins jump into the ocean:**
   Since one-third of the penguins jump into the ocean, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

3. **Subtract the number of penguins that jumped into the ocean from the total:**
   \[
   36 - 12 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, 24 penguins are not yet in the ocean.

4. **Calculate how many penguins go inside the cave:**
   Again, since one-third of the remaining penguins (after those who went to the ocean) go inside the cave, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
   \]
   So, 8 penguins go inside the cave.

5. **Subtract the number of penguins that went inside the cave from the remaining ones:**
   \[
   24 - 8 = 16

   Therefore, 16 penguins are still left sunbathing.

So, the final answer is: The final answer is 16.<|im_end|>","This many penguins are swimming: 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 penguins.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many vines Steve needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve consumes daily:**
   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

2. **Determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats:**
   - Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we calculate her consumption.
     \[
     \text{Tomatoes for girlfriend} = \frac{\text{Steve's tomatoes}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes produced weekly by one vine:**
   - One vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes needed weekly:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of vines needed.
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of tomatoes needed per week is \( 3x \).

5. **Set up the equation based on the information that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day and there are 7 days in a week:**
   - Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total number of tomatoes Steve eats per week is:
     \[
     6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
     \]
   - This must equal the total number of tomatoes produced by all the vines combined.
     \[
     3x = 42
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{42}{3} = 14
   \]

Therefore, Steve needs 14 vines to meet his tomato consumption needs.<|im_end|>","His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day

To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed:**
   - Each friend gets 4 slices.
   - There are 20 friends.

\[
\text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}
\]

\[
\text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80
\]

2. **Determine the number of slices per pizza:**
   - Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas required:**
   - We divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

\[
\text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ram starts with 25 pens.
   - Each time he refills his pens, it takes him 4 units of ink (since 5 empty pens equal 1 full pen).
   - The cost of one unit of ink is $0.05.

2. **Refilling Process:**
   - To refill his pens, Ram needs 4 units of ink per pen.
   - Since he has 25 pens, he will need \(25 \times 4 = 100\) units of ink in total.
   - The cost for this amount of ink is \(100 \times 0.05 = \$5\).

3. **Calculating Total Pens:**
   - After using up the first set of 25 pens, he has no ink left.
   - He now has 25 empty pens and plans to use these to create more pens.
   - Each time he refills his pens, it costs him $0.25 (since 5 empty pens equal 1 full pen), which means he gets back into the loop of needing 4 units of ink per pen.

4. **Creating New Pens:**
   - For every 25 pens he uses, he effectively creates an additional pen because he already had a pen before starting the process again.
   - Therefore, if he keeps going indefinitely, he will eventually create as many new pens as there were original pens plus whatever he started with.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Starting with 25 pens, after the initial 25 pens, he will continue to create new pens based on the same ratio.
   - So, he will keep creating pens until he either runs out of ink or decides to stop.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Ram will be able to create an infinite number of new pens since he always has enough ink to create a new pen whenever he needs one.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
{The final answer is} Infinite pens. Ram will never run out of ink to create new pens.<|im_end|>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on their relationships and then find the sum of their ages.

1. **Identify the age of Jessa:**
   - We know that Jessa is 20 years old.
   
2. **Determine Joan's age:**
   - According to the problem, Joan is five years older than Jessa.
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5
     \]
     Substituting Jessa's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine Mary's age:**
   - The problem states that Mary is two years younger than Joan.
     \[
     \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2
     \]
     Substituting Joan's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23

4. **Calculate the sum of the ages:**
   - Now, we add up the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.
     \[
     \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age}

     Adding these together:
     \[
     23 + 25 = 48

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students who left the hall.

Given that there were originally 1000 students in the hall, let's denote the total number of students who left as \( T \).

Since 30% of the students went out through exit A, we can write:
\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]

So, \( T = 300 \) students left through exit A.

### Step 2: Determine how many students remain after those who went out through exit A.

After 300 students leave through exit A, the remaining number of students is:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.

According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students (after exiting through exit A) go out through exit B. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]

So, \( T - 300 \) students went out through exit B.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

Finally, since the rest of the students go out through exit C, we subtract the number of students who exited through exit B from the remaining students after exiting through exit A:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is **280**.<|im_end|>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.

### Step 1: Determine the number of candies Robert has

We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert. We also know that John has 54 candies. So, if \( R \) represents the number of candies Robert has, then:
\[ J = 2R \]
where \( J \) (John's candies) equals 54.

From this equation, we can find out how many candies Robert has:
\[ 54 = 2R \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candies James has

James has 6 more candies than Robert. Since Robert has 27 candies, we add 6 to get James' total:
\[ I = R + 6 \]
Substitute \( R \) from our previous calculation:
\[ I = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies.

### Step 3: Compare the number of candies John and James have

Now, we compare the number of candies John and James have:
- John has 54 candies.
- James has 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has compared to James, subtract James' total from John's total:
\[ \text{Difference} = J - I \]
Where \( J \) is John's candies (54), and \( I \) is James' candies (33):
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The difference in the number of candies between John and James is 21.<|im_end|>","Robert has 54/2 = <<54/2=27>>27 candies.
James has 27+6 = <<27+6=33>>33 candies.
John has 54-33= <<54-33=21>>21 more candies than James.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read ; each others' books : as well as their own, how many books will they collectively read , by the end?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person has and then determine how many books they collectively read.

1. **Identify the total number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Calculate the total number of books if they share all their books together:**
   - Since Dolly has 2 books and Pandora has 1 book, when they combine them, they have a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

3. **Determine how many books each person reads from these combined books:**
   - When they share the 3 books, each person can choose any combination of the books, but since the problem specifies that they read ""each others' books"" and also their own, it implies that each person will read at least half of the combined books plus their own books.
   
4. **Calculate the minimum number of books each person needs to read:**
   - Each person needs to read enough books to cover the total number of books available (which is 3). This means each person should read either 1 or 2 books to ensure they get an equal distribution.
   - If each person reads 1 book, they will collectively read \(1 \times 2 = 2\) books in total. However, this does not account for reading ""each other's books,"" so let's adjust our approach.

5. **Adjust the approach considering ""reading each other's books"":**
   - Reading ""each other's books"" implies that each person must read books that belong to both collections. For example, if Dolly reads her own book and Pandora reads one of her books, they effectively read together. So, each person should read more than just their own book.
   - Let's assume each person reads 2 books in total to maximize overlap and ensure fairness in sharing.

6. **Final calculation based on the adjusted approach:**
   - If each person reads 2 books in total, then the collective count would be \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 4 books.<|im_end|>","There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Pen Pal Relationships**:
   - Mike has 5 pen pals.

2. **Pen Pal Relationship Changes**:
   - Mike stops being a pen pal with 2 out of these 5 people.
   - This means there are now only 3 pen pals left for Mike.

3. **Letters Sent per Week**:
   - Each of the remaining 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters sent per week = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) letters.

4. **Pages Per Letter**:
   - Each letter consists of 5 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages sent per week = \(6 \times 5 = 30\) pages.

5. **Writing Speed**:
   - Mike writes 1 page every 6 minutes.
   - Since he writes 30 pages per week, we need to calculate how long it takes him to write all these pages.

6. **Time Spent Writing**:
   - Time taken to write 30 pages = \(30 \div 6 = 5\) hours (since he writes at a rate of 1 page every 6 minutes).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The time Mike spends writing per week is 5 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 5 hours.<|im_end|>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate total monthly minutes allowed:**
   - Jason has a plan that allows him 1000 minutes per month.

2. **Calculate minutes used for daily calls:**
   - Each day, Jason makes a 15-minute call.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Therefore, the total number of minutes spent on these calls is \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Subtract the used minutes from the total monthly allowance:**
   - Total minutes allowed: 1000 minutes
   - Minutes used for calls: 450 minutes
   - Remaining minutes after calls: \( 1000 \text{ minutes} - 450 \text{ minutes} = 550 \text{ minutes} \)

4. **Account for any additional minutes used:**
   - Jason has an additional 300 extra minutes of call time.
   - Subtract these extra minutes from the remaining minutes after calling: 
     \( 550 \text{ minutes} - 300 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \).

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial number of fries Griffin has.
2. Calculate the number of fries Kyle took.
3. Calculate the number of fries Billy took.
4. Determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.
5. Verify the total number of fries Griffin ends up with.

Let's start with the initial number of fries Griffin has: 
- Griffin initially had 24 fries.

Kyle took 5 fries:
- Griffin now has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle:
- Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries:
- Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\).

Colby took 3 fewer fries than what Kyle took:
- Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.

After all these transactions, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. We can set up an equation to find \(x\):

\[ \text{Initial fries} + \text{Fries given by Ginger} - (\text{Fries taken by Kyle} + \text{Fries taken by Billy} + \text{Fries taken by Colby}) = \text{Final fries} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 24 + x - (5 + 10 + 2) = 27 \]

Simplify inside the parentheses first:

\[ 24 + x - 17 = 27 \]

Now, simplify further:

\[ 24 + x - 17 = 27 \]
\[ 24 + x - 17 = 27 \]
\[ 6 + x = 27 \]

Finally, isolate \(x\):

\[ x = 27 - 6 \]
\[ x = 21 \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 21 fries. The final answer is {The final answer is}: 21 fries.<|im_end|>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.

   - Aquarium A has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium B has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Understand that this difference represents twice the amount of fish in both aquariums:**
   Let \( F \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium. According to the problem, the difference (28) is twice the number of fish in either aquarium:
   \[
   2F = 28
   \]

4. **Solve for \( F \):**
   \[

   - In Aquarium A: Number of fish = 14
   - In Aquarium B: Number of fish = 14
   - Difference: \( 14 - 4 = 10 \)
   - Twice the difference: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \)

Since the calculated value matches the given condition, we can conclude that each aquarium contains 14 fish.

To solve this problem, we need to break down the costs into several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup**

- Hours per day = 6
- Days per week = 7 (since the movie is done 4 times a week)
- Weeks to complete = 5

Total hours = \( 6 \times 7 \times 5 \)

\[ Total\ hours = 210 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the base cost without any discounts**

Base cost per hour = $250

Total base cost = \( 250 \times 210 \)

\[ Total\ base\ cost = \$52,500 \]

**Step 3: Apply the 10% discount**

Discount rate = 10%

Discounted total cost = \( 52,500 - (52,500 \times 0.1) \)

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount spent.
2. Divide the total amount by 3 (since there are 3 people splitting the cost).

Let's start with step 1.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent.
We have:
- Cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$12 + \$43 + \$15 + \$4 + \$22 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ \$12 + \$43 = \$55 \]
\[ \$55 + \$15 = \$70 \]
\[ \$70 + \$4 = \$74 \]
\[ \$74 + \$22 = \$96 \]

So, the total cost is $96.

Step 2: Divide the total cost by 3.
Since Isabelle is splitting the cost evenly among her two parents, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{\$96}{3} = \$32 \]

Therefore, each person paid $\boxed{32}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Isabelle spent 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = $<<12+43+15+4+22=96>>96 on party supplies.

  - Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
  - Therefore, Sue ate \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.

- **Tuesday**: Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
  - Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Sue ate \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both on each day**

- **Total cookies eaten on Monday**:
  - Sister: 5 cookies

### Step 3: Determine the number of girls in each class.
We know the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of boys in each class based on the given information.
Since the total number of boys is 30, we can use the proportionality between boys and girls to find out how many boys are in each class.

Let \( B_i \) represent the number of boys in the \( i \)-th class.

For the first class (with 15 girls):

\[
B_1 = \frac{15}{30} \times 30 = 15
\]

For the second class (with 12 girls):

\[
B_2 = \frac{12}{30} \times 30 = 12
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.
Now, knowing that the total number of boys is 30, and assuming the distribution remains proportional for simplicity (since no other specific information about gender ratios is provided), we calculate the number of boys in the third class as follows:

\[
B_3 = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is **15**.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many wolves Rick killed today.
2. Determine how many cougars Rick killed today.
3. Sum up all the animals Rick killed in total.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Wolves:
- Last night: Rick killed 10 wolves.
- Today, he kills three times as many wolves as cougars from last night.

From the information given:
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cougars Rick killed last night.
- According to the problem, \( C = 15 \).

Since today he kills three times as many wolves as cougars from last night:
\[ W_{\text{today}} = 3 \times C \]

Substitute \( C = 15 \):
\[ W_{\text{today}} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

So, Rick killed 45 wolves today.

#### Cougars:
- Last night: Rick killed 15 cougars.
- Today, he kills three fewer cougars than the previous night.

From the information given:
- \( C_{\text{last night}} = 15 \).
- Today, he kills three fewer cougars than last night:
\[ C_{\text{today}} = C_{\text{last night}} - 3 \]

Substitute \( C_{\text{last night}} = 15 \):
\[ C_{\text{today}} = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

So, Rick killed 12 cougars today.

#### Total Animals Killed:
- Wolves: 45
- Cougars: 12
- Add them together:
\[ \text{Total} = 45 + 12 = 57 \]

Therefore, Rick killed a total of **57** animals.

The final answer is:
The final answer is: 57<|im_end|>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25

To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many times Anne went down the water slide.
2. Use that information to find out how many times Robert went down the water slide.

Let's start with Step 1: Determining how many times Anne went down the water slide.

Step 1a: Calculate the number of times Anne went down the water slide.
Anne went down the water slide 30% less than Mitchel. Mitchel went down 30 times.

First, calculate 30% of 30:
\[ 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

Next, subtract this value from 30:
\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

So, Anne went down the water slide 21 times.

Step 2: Using the information about Anne, determine how many times Robert went down the water slide.

Step 2a: Calculate the number of times Robert went down the water slide.
Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne. Since Anne went down 21 times, Robert will go down:
\[ 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cows before Mr. Sylas's purchase:**
   - There are 10 stalls.
   - Each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows initially is \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.

2. **Calculate the number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys more cows:**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   - After buying these cows, the total number of cows becomes \(200 + 40 = 240\) cows.

3. **Divide the total number of cows equally among the 20 stalls:**
   - The total number of cows (240) will be divided equally among the 20 stalls.
   - Each stall will get \(240 / 20 = 12\) cows.

4. **Verify the distribution:**
   - Since there are 240 cows and they are divided equally among 20 stalls, each stall should indeed have 12 cows.

5. **Find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls:**
   - If each stall has 12 cows, then 8 stalls would have \(8 \times 12 = 96\) cows.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 96.<|im_end|>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total value of the coins and the dollar bill Brady has in his piggy bank.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01/\text{penny} = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   \[
   40 \text{ nickels} \times \$0.05/\text{nickel} = \$2.00

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[
   20 \text{ dimes} \times \$0.10/\text{dime} = \$2.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   \[
   40 \text{ dollar bills} \times \$1.00/\text{dollar bill} = \$40.00
   \]

5. **Sum up all the values:**
   - Value from pennies: $1.00
   - Value from nickels: $2.00
   - Value from dimes: $2.00
   - Value from dollar bills: $40.00
   \[
   \$1.00 + \$2.00 + \$2.00 + \$40.00 = \$49.00
   \]

### Final Answer:
Brady has a total of $49.00 in his piggy bank.<|im_end|>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood:**
   - The given information states that each solid 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
   - We need to find out how many such sections there are in the entire height of the redwood.

2. **Determine the number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot redwood:**
   - The total height of the redwood is 200 feet.
   - Since each section is 10 feet long, we can divide the total height by the length of one section to get the number of sections.
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Length of one section}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20

3. **Calculate the total weight of all sections combined:**
   - Each section weighs 400 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight for all sections will be:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Subtract the amount eaten by termites from the total weight:**
   - Termites eat 30% of the redwood’s wood.
   - To find out how much was eaten, calculate 30% of the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times \text{Total weight} = 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Subtract the weight eaten by termites from the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many apples Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Find out how many apples Jamal has:**
   - Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     A = J + 8
     \]
     where \(A\) represents Andrea's apples and \(J\) represents Jamal's apples.
   
3. **Substitute the number of apples Andrea has into the equation to find Jamal's apples:**
   - We know \(A = 52\), so:
     \[
     52 = J + 8
     \]
   - Solving for \(J\):
     \[
     J = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]

4. **Calculate how many bananas Jamal has:**
   - Since Jamal has half as many bananas as apples, we calculate:
     \[
     B_J = \frac{A}{2}
     \]
     Substituting \(A = 52\):
     \[
     B_J = \frac{52}{2} = 26
     \]

5. **Find out how many apples Jamal has:**
   - Since Jamal has 4 more apples than bananas, we have:
     \[
     A_J = B_J + 4
     \]
     Substituting \(B_J = 26\):
     \[
     A_J = 26 + 4 = 30
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - Now, add all the fruits together:
     \[
     Total = A_A + A_J + B_A + B_J
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     Total = 52 + 30 + 26 + 26 = 134

2. **Calculate the amount of flour required per cookie:**
   - We know that two cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies.
   - Therefore, one cup of flour is needed for 6 cookies (since 12/2 = 6).

3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for all cookies:**
   - For 66 cookies, the calculation would be:
     \[
     \text{Total flour} = \frac{\text{Number of cookies}}{\text{Cookies per cup}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total flour} = \frac{66}{6}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total flour} = 11 \text{ cups}
     \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake both sets of cookies.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{11 \text{ cups}}<|im_end|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pennies in the stack**: 
   - We know there are 9,300 pennies in the entire cup.
   - The stack contains two-thirds of the pennies in the cup.

2. **Calculate the number of pennies in the stack**:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money each girl has and then sum their amounts.

Step 1: Determine how much money Carmen has.
- Carmen has $100.

Step 2: Determine how much money Samantha has.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen.
- Therefore, Samantha's amount = Carmen's amount + $25.
- So, Samantha's amount = $100 + $25 = $125.

Step 3: Determine how much money Daisy has.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha.
- Therefore, Daisy's amount = Samantha's amount + $50.
- So, Daisy's amount = $125 + $50 = $175.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money all three girls have combined.
- Total = Carmen's amount + Samantha's amount + Daisy's amount.
- So, Total = $100 + $125 + $175.

Step 5: Perform the addition.
- Total = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, let's break down the costs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Brokerage Fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times \$350,000 = \$17,500 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Transfer Fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times \$350,000 = \$42,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Price Including Fees
First, add the selling price to the brokerage fee.
\[ \text{Total Price Before Fees} = \$350,000 + \$17,500 = \$367,500 \]

Next, add the transfer fee to this amount.
\[ \text{Total Price After Fees} = \$367,500 + \$42,000 = \$409,500 \]

### Step 4: Compare the Total Price to Mrs. Cruz's Budget
Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total price is compared to her budget.
\[ \text{Difference} = \$409,500 - \$400,000 = \$9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. 

\[

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   - The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000.
   - Transfer fees = 3% × $400,000.

\[
\text{Transfer Fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000
\]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   - The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   - Selling price = $400,000.
   - Brokerage fee = 5% × $400,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000
\]

3. **Add the transfer fees and brokerage fees together:**

\[
\text{Total Fees} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000
\]

4. **Subtract the total fees from the selling price:**

\[
\text{Net Proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 = \$368,000
\]

5. **Subtract the remaining loan amount from the net proceeds:**

\[
\text{Final Net Proceeds} = \$368,000 - \$250,000 = \$118,000
\]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are **$118,000**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time from when you start heating the oil until you have cooked the chicken. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to reach 400 degrees
- The oil heats up to 300 degrees in 20 minutes.
- To reach 400 degrees, which is an increase of \(400 - 300 = 100\) degrees, it will take \(\frac{40}{60} \times 20 = 13.33\) minutes (since the heating time increases linearly).

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook the chicken
- It takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken compared to how long it took to warm up the oil.

Given that it takes 20 minutes to warm up the oil:

\[ \text{Time to cook} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time
- Start the oil at time 0.
- Heating time: 20 minutes.
- Cooking time: 15 minutes after cooking.

Total time passed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 20 + 15 = 35 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both the newspapers and televisions ads separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for newspaper ads.
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

\[
\text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = \text{Number of ads} \times \text{Cost per ad}
\]

\[
= 50 \times 5 = \$250
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for television ads.
- Each television ad costs $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

\[
\text{Total cost for television ads} = \text{Number of ads} \times \text{Cost per ad}
\]

\[
= 15 \times 75 = \$1125
\]

### Step 3: Sum the total costs from both types of ads.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost for television ads}
\]

\[

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many M&Ms are in the second bag**
- We know from the problem statement that the second bag contains 12 more M&Ms than the first.
- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.

Therefore, we can calculate the number of M&Ms in the second bag as follows:
\[ \text{Number of M&Ms in second bag} = 300 + 12 = 312 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of M&Ms in the third bag**
- According to the problem, the third bag has a hole in it, so it contains half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had.
- Since the first bag has 300 M&Ms, the third bag will have:
\[ \text{Number of M&Ms in third bag} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

**Step 3: Sum up all the M&Ms**
- Now, let's add up the M&Ms from all three bags to find out how many M&Ms Mary got in total:
\[ \text{Total number of M&Ms} = 300 (\text{first bag}) + 312 (\text{second bag}) + 150 (\text{third bag}) \]
\[ \text{Total number of M&Ms} = 762 \]

- John has 2 houses.
- Each house has 3 bedrooms.

So, the total number of bedrooms = \(2 \times 3 = 6\).

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows in all bedrooms combined
- Each bedroom has 2 windows.
- Therefore, for 6 bedrooms, the total number of windows in all bedrooms combined is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) windows.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of extra windows per house
- There are 4 extra windows in each house.

Since there are two houses, the total number of extra windows = \(2 \times 4 = 8\) windows.

### Step 5: Add the windows from bedrooms and extra windows together
Total windows = Windows in bedrooms + Extra windows
= \(12 + 8 = 20\)

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is **20**.<|im_end|>","Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms
So each house has 6+4=<<6+4=10>>10 windows
So the total number of windows is 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 windows

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

Let's add these amounts together.

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65
$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total amount spent on the items is $15.00.

Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid by the customer.
- Amount paid: $20.00

Change received = $20.00 - $15.00

Subtracting these values gives us:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the change given back to the cashier is $5.00.

Ending answer: The final answer is: The change given back to the cashier is $5.00.<|im_end|>","The total shopping cost is $4.2 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $<<4.2+9.45+1.35=15>>15.

                    question:
                    Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, ; a collar, and a decorative : rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, ! the collar takes a tenth of that number of stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as , the collar. The whole sweater is an ? 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each sleeve take?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many stitches each sleeve takes in the sweater, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.
Given that the collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches needed for the body of the sweater.

- Body of the sweater = 900 stitches
- Collar stitches = \( \frac{900}{10} \)

\[
\text{Collar stitches} = 90 \quad (\text{since } 900 / 10 = 90)
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette.
The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.

- Collar stitches = 90 stitches
- Rosette stitches = \( 2 \times 90 \)

\[
\text{Rosette stitches} = 180 \quad (\text{since } 90 \times 2 = 180)
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of stitches for the body of the sweater, the collar, and the rosette.
We know the entire sweater is 1800 stitches long.

\[
\text{Total stitches} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \quad (\text{since } 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170)
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the number of stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total number of stitches.
This will give us the number of stitches used for the sleeves.

\[
\text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \quad (\text{since } 1800 - 1170 = 630)
\]

### Step 5: Divide the number of stitches for the sleeves by 2 (since there are two sleeves).
\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \quad (\text{since } 630 / 2 = 315)
\]

### Final Answer:
Each sleeve takes **315** stitches.<|im_end|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

                    question:
                    It's April, and Mrs. Rylan has ? been . busy on her farm planting different types of vegetables for the season.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying both tomato seeds and celery seeds.

1. **Calculate the cost of tomato seeds:**
   - Number of packets of tomato seeds = 20
   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds = $40
   - Total cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of celery seeds:**
   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80
   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30
   - Total cost of celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
     \[
     \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Add the costs together to find the total amount spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} + \text{Total cost of celery seeds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 800 + 2400 = 3200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used a total of $3200 to buy the seeds for her farm.<|im_end|>","The total amount of money she used to buy the tomato seeds is 20 packets * $40/packet = $<<20*40=800>>800

                    question:
                    Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines . for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines ; in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of ; lines, but only a third ! of them are his lines. , The second scene has six ? more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How , many lines does Sean have to memorize?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many lines Sean needs to memorize, we will break down the information provided and calculate step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of lines in the solo song.
- The solo song has 54 lines.

### Step 2: Determine the number of lines in the first scene.
- The first scene has twice as many lines as the song.
- Number of lines in the first scene = \(2 \times 54\)

\[
2 \times 54 = 108
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of lines that are not Sean's in the first scene.
- Only three out of every five lines in the first scene are Sean's.
- Therefore, four-fifths of the lines are not Sean's.
- Number of lines not Sean's in the first scene = \( \frac{4}{5} \times 108 \)

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 108 = 91.2
\]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a line, this calculation suggests there might be an error or inconsistency in the given data. Let's assume it's meant to be rounded or simplified appropriately.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of lines that are not Sean's in the second scene.
- Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are not Sean's.
- Number of lines not Sean's in the second scene = \( \frac{4}{5} \times (6 + x) \)

where \(x\) represents additional lines beyond those in the song.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of lines that are not Sean's in the first scene.
- From Step 3, the number of lines not Sean's in the first scene is 91.2.

Given the context, let's simplify our approach:

### Simplified Approach:
Assuming the correct interpretation without fractional lines, let’s re-evaluate the first scene:

- If four-fifths of the lines in the first scene are not Sean's:
  - Then one-fifth must be Sean's lines.

Therefore,
- Number of lines in the first scene = 108

### Step 6: Calculate the number of lines Sean has to memorize.
- Lines from the first scene:
  - Half of the lines are his.
  - Lines from the song:
    - Sixty percent of the lines.

Let's calculate these:

- Lines from the first scene:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54
  \]

- Lines from the song:
  \[
  0.6 \times 54 = 32.4
  \]

Adding these together gives the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:

\[
54 + 32.4 = 86.4
\]

Since we can't have a decimal number of lines, we round up or down based on practicality.

Final Answer: 
The final answer is \(87\) lines.<|im_end|>","The first scene has twice the number of lines as his solo song, so it has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines.
A third of them are Sean’s lines, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines.
The second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines.
Four fifths of the second scene’s lines are Sean’s, so he has to memorize 4 * 60 / 5 = 4 * 12 = <<4*60/5=48>>48 lines.
Sean has to memorize his entire solo song, so he has to memorize 54 + 36 + 48 = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines in all.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cards have each letter on them. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cards with A on them.
Carly has 80 cards in total.

- **Fraction of cards with A**: \( \frac{2}{5} \)

\[ \text{Number of cards with A} = 80 \times \frac{2}{5} \]

\[
= 32
\]

So, there are 32 cards that have the letter A on them.

### Step 2: Subtract the number of cards with A from the total.
Subtracting the number of cards with A from the total gives us the remaining cards:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

There are 48 cards left after accounting for those with A.

### Step 3: Determine the fraction of these remaining cards with B.
- **Fraction of remaining cards with B**: \( \frac{1}{2} \)

\[ \text{Number of cards with B} = 48 \times \frac{1}{2} \]

\[
= 24
\]

So, there are 24 cards that have the letter B on them.

### Step 4: Subtract the number of cards with B from the remaining cards.
Subtracting the number of cards with B from the remaining cards gives us the new set of cards:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

There are 24 cards left after accounting for those with B.

### Step 5: Determine the fraction of these remaining cards with C.
- **Fraction of remaining cards with C**: \( \frac{5}{8} \)

\[ \text{Number of cards with C} = 24 \times \frac{5}{8} \]

\[
= 15
\]

So, there are 15 cards that have the letter C on them.

### Step 6: Calculate the remaining cards which have the letter D on them.
Subtracting the number of cards with C from the remaining cards gives us the final count:

\[ 24 - 15 = 9 \]

Therefore, there are 9 cards that have the letter D on them.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

{The final answer is}. 9<|im_end|>","The number of cards with the letter A on them is 2/5*80 = <<2/5*80=32>>32 cards.

To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the time to dig one small hole.
Matthew spends **3 minutes** digging one small hole.

### Step 2: Calculate the time to dig one large hole.
Matthew spends **10 minutes** digging one large hole.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time to dig all small holes.
- Number of small holes = 30
- Time per small hole = 3 minutes

Total time for small holes = \( 30 \times 3 \) minutes

\[
= 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time to dig all large holes.
- Number of large holes = 15
- Time per large hole = 10 minutes

Total time for large holes = \( 15 \times 10 \) minutes

\[

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current age difference**: We need more information about how much older one person is compared to the other. However, since we don't have enough data to determine the exact age difference, we'll proceed under the assumption that they are equal for simplicity.

   Let's denote their current age as \( x \).

2. **Set up the equation for the sum of their ages**:
   According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 20.
   \[
   x + x = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   2x = 20

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{2} = 10

   So, both Mico and Marco are currently 10 years old.

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages in 10 years**:
   In 10 years, each person will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old.
   Therefore, the total sum of their ages after 10 years will be:
   \[
   (10 + 10) + (10 + 10) = 20 + 20 = 40

5. **Conclusion**:
   The sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 40.<|im_end|>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for Sam's current age.

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.
   Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, Ruby’s current age can be represented as \( 6S \).

2. **Set up an equation for their ages in 9 years:**
   - In 9 years, Sam will be \( S + 9 \).
   - In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \).

   According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   First, expand the right side of the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
   
   Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( S \):
   \[
   6S - 3S + 9 = 27
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]

   Subtract 9 from both sides to isolate \( 3S \):
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]

   Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Sam is currently 6 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the popsicles
- Number of popsicles: 20
- Cost per popsicle: $0.25

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Cost per popsicle}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars
- Number of ice cream bars: 4
- Cost per ice cream bar: $0.50

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Cost per ice cream bar}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the costs
Now, add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of popsicles} + \text{Total cost of ice cream bars}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 5 + 2
\]

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 7 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Peter paid a total of **$7**.<|im_end|>","The popsicles cost 0.25*20=<<0.25*20=5>>5 dollars.
The ice cream bars cost 0.5*4=<<0.5*4=2>>2 dollars.
He paid 5+2=<<5+2=7>>7 dollars.

                    question:
                    A cobra, which has 70 spots, has . twice as many spots as a mamba. If there are 40 cobras , and 60 mambas in a snake park, what is half the number of spots ! they all have combined?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of spots on one mamba:**
   - We know that a cobra has 70 spots.
   - A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Let \( S_m \) represent the number of spots on one mamba.

   Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2S_m = 70
   \]
   Solving for \( S_m \):
   \[
   S_m = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of spots on all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   
   The total number of spots on all cobras is:
   \[
   40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots on all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 35 spots.
   
   The total number of spots on all mambas is:
   \[
   60 \times 35 = 2100
   \]

4. **Combine the total spots from both snakes:**
   \[
   2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. **Find half of the combined total spots:**
   \[
   \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
   \]

Therefore, half the number of spots that all the snakes have combined is 2450.<|im_end|>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.
If there are 40 cobras in a snake park, they all have a total of 70*40 = <<40*70=2800>>2800 spots.
60 mambas in a snake park, each having 35 spots, have 60*35 = <<60*35=2100>>2100 spots total.
Together, all the snakes in the park have 2100+2800=<<2100+2800=4900>>4900 spots.
Half the number of spots they all have combined is 1/2*4900=<<1/2*4900=2450>>2450

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people attending the event.
- **Number of team members**: 12
- **Number of coaches**: 3
- **Number of guests per team member**: 2

First, calculate the total number of guests brought by the team members:
\[ \text{Total guests} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, add the number of coaches to the total number of guests:
\[ \text{Total attendees} = 12 + 3 + 24 = 40 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are needed.
Each pizza serves 3 people.

To find out how many pizzas are required, divide the total number of attendees by the number of people each pizza can feed:
\[ \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

Since you can't have a fraction of a pizza, round up to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Number of pizzas} = 14 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pizzas.
Each pizza costs $15.

Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 14 \times 15 = \$210 \]

### Final Answer:
Maddy will spend \(\boxed{\$210}\).<|im_end|>","Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of topaz gemstones in each necklace:**
   - Each necklace requires 8 topaz gemstones.

2. **Calculate the total length required for the topaz gemstones:**
   - Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, 8 gemstones will be \(8 \times 1 = 8\) inches in total.

3. **Find out how much total length remains after accounting for the topaz gemstones:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - After removing the 8-inch segment from the topaz gemstones, we have \(25 - 8 = 17\) inches remaining.

4. **Calculate the length of the sterling silver beads:**
   - Sterling silver beads fill the remaining space.
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches (one-quarter of an inch) long.
   - Therefore, the number of beads needed is \( \frac{17}{0.25} \).

5. **Perform the division to find the number of beads:**
   - \( \frac{17}{0.25} = 68 \)

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 68 beads.<|im_end|>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of stories Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote in the first week.
2. Determine how many stories each person wrote in the second week (which is double their first-week totals).
3. Sum up the total number of stories from both weeks.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of stories in the first week
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Total for the first week = \(20 + 40 + 60\)

\[ Total \; for \; the \; first \; week = 120 \]

### Step 2: Double the number of stories for the second week
For each person, the second week's writing equals twice their first-week count.

- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, so she will write \(20 \times 2\) in the second week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week, so he will write \(40 \times 2\) in the second week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week, so she will write \(60 \times 2\) in the second week.

Calculating the second-week counts:

Alani: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories
Braylen: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories
Margot: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories

### Step 3: Sum up the total number of stories from both weeks
Now, let's add up all the stories from both weeks:

- First week total: 120 stories
- Second week total: \(40 + 80 + 120\)

\[Second \; week \; total = 40 + 80 + 120\]

\[Second \; week \; total = 240\]

### Final Answer Calculation:
Adding the first-week total and the second-week total gives us:

\[Total \; number \; of \; stories = 120 + 240\]

\[Total \; number \; of \; stories = 360\]

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is **360**.<|im_end|>","In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, and if she doubled the number in the second week, the total number of stories in the second week is 20*2 = <<20*2=40>>40.

2. Calculate the age difference between Ann and her brother.
3. Add the age difference to Ann's brother's current age.

Step 1: Determine Ann's brother's current age.
- Ann is 9 years old.
- Her brother is twice as old as Ann.

So, we calculate her brother's age:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Step 2: Calculate the age difference between Ann and her brother.
- The age difference is simply the difference between their ages:
\[ \text{Age difference} = 18 - 9 = 9 \]

Step 3: Add the age difference to Ann's brother's current age.
- We need to find out how old her brother will be in 3 years:
\[ \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 9 = 27 \]

2. Subtract the cost of the can of pop from her total amount.
3. Determine if there is enough money left after purchasing the can of pop.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly currently has.
Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.
- Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth \(5 \times 25 = 125\) cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth \(2 \times 10 = 20\) cents.
Adding these together gives us the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[125 + 20 = 145\] cents.

Step 2: Subtract the cost of the can of pop from her total amount.
The can of pop costs 55 cents.
So, we subtract 55 cents from 145 cents:
\[145 - 55 = 90\] cents.

Step 3: Determine if there is enough money left after purchasing the can of pop.
Since 90 cents is more than zero, Kelly will have enough money left to purchase the can of pop.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to carefully count the number of 5-star rows in the given 76-star flag.

1. **Count the total number of stars:**
   - There are three rows of 8 stars.
   - There are two rows of 6 stars.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of 5-star rows.

2. **Calculate the total number of stars:**
   The total number of stars is given as 76.

3. **Set up an equation for the total number of stars:**
   \[
   8 \times 3 + 6 \times 2 + 5x = 76
   \]
   Here, \( 8 \times 3 \) represents the stars from the first type (three rows of eight), \( 6 \times 2 \) represents the stars from the second type (two rows of six), and \( 5x \) represents the stars from the third type (unknown number of five-star rows).

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   24 + 12 + 5x = 76
   \]

5. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   36 + 5x = 76

6. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Subtract 36 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 76 - 36

   Simplify further:
   \[
   5x = 40

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 8

To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones:**
   - Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   - Number of flagstones = 80.
   - Total weight of 80 flagstones = \( 75 \text{ pounds/flagstone} \times 80 \text{ flagstones} \).

\[

2. **Determine how many trucks are required to carry this total weight:**
   - Each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds.
   - We need to find out how many such trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Number of trucks} &= \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Weight per truck}} \\

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the slower car:**
   - The faster car travels at 60 mph.
   - The slower car travels at half the speed of the faster car.

\[
\text{Speed of slower car} = \frac{\text{Speed of faster car}}2 = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ mph}
\]

2. **Calculate the time taken by the faster car to travel 480 miles:**

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480}{60} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

3. **Verify the calculation using the time taken by the slower car:**

- The slower car also traveled 480 miles at 30 mph.

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

However, since the time taken by the slower car should be equal to the time taken by the faster car (as they both travel the same distance), there seems to be an inconsistency. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and ensure all conditions are met correctly.

Given that the faster car traveled for 8 hours and the slower car must have traveled for the same duration as calculated from its speed, let's correct our approach:

1. Calculate the time taken by the faster car to travel 480 miles:
   
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

2. Verify if the slower car takes the same amount of time to cover 480 miles:
   
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} = 16 \text{ hours}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many medals Izzy has.
2. Calculate the total number of medals between Ali and Izzy.
3. Find out how many medals were given out in total.

Step 1: Determine how many medals Izzy has.
- We know that Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.
- Ali has 22 medals.
- Therefore, Izzy has \( 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of medals between Ali and Izzy.
- Together, they have \( 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

Step 3: Find out how many medals were given out in total.
- The problem states that together they have 10 times less medals than those given out.
- Let's denote the total number of medals given out as \( x \).
- According to the information provided, \( 39 = 10x \).

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{39}{10} = 3.9 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is **3.9**.<|im_end|>","Izzy has 22-5=<<22-5=17>>17 medal

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars:**
   - There are 8 packets of chocolate bars.
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   - Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars = \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

2. **Determine how many chocolate bars each adult receives:**
   - There are 4 adults.
   - Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
   - Total chocolate bars given to adults = \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

3. **Subtract the chocolate bars already distributed from the total:**
   - The total number of chocolate bars = 40.
   - Chocolate bars given to adults = 24.
   - Remaining chocolate bars for children = \(40 - 24 = 16\).

4. **Divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the children:**
   - There are 8 children.
   - Remaining chocolate bars (for children) = 16.
   - Chocolate bars per child = \(16 \div 8 = 2\).

Therefore, each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer:** Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.<|im_end|>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task she does. If she works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. and pauses in between for ? half an hour, how much money does she earn for ; the , online task?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money Susan earns from her online task, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Susan spends working:**
   - Susan starts at 8 a.m.
   - She works until 11 a.m.
   - The duration from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. is 3 hours.

2. **Convert the work time into minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, 3 hours is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

3. **Determine the number of intervals during which Susan can work without pausing:**
   - Susan pauses for half an hour (which is 30 minutes).
   - To find out how many intervals she can work, divide the total work time by the pause interval.
   
4. **Calculate the number of work intervals:**
   - Total work time: 180 minutes
   - Pause interval: 30 minutes
   - Number of work intervals = \(\frac{180}{30} = 6\)

5. **Calculate the earnings per work interval:**
   - Susan earns $5 for every 10 minutes of work.
   - For each 10-minute interval, she earns $5.

6. **Compute the total earnings over all work intervals:**
   - Each work interval is 10 minutes long.
   - There are 6 work intervals.
   - Therefore, her total earnings = \(6 \times 5 = \$30\).

7. **Finalize the calculation considering the total work period:**
   - We initially calculated that Susan worked for 180 minutes but paused for 30 minutes.
   - So, effectively, she worked for \(180 - 30 = 150\) minutes.

8. **Re-evaluate her earnings based on effective work time:**
   - At $5 per 10 minutes, she would have earned $5 for each 10-minute segment if she had worked continuously.
   - However, since she worked only 150 minutes instead of 180 minutes, we need to adjust our calculation.

9. **Correctly calculate the adjusted earnings:**
   - Her actual earnings should be based on the correct amount of work time.
   - If she worked 150 minutes, she would earn \(150 \div 10 \times 5 = 75\) dollars.

Therefore, the correct amount of money Susan earns from her online task is $\boxed{75}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.

She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the initial points for each player before the fourth round**

- **Mike's Points**: Given as 21 points.
  
- **Jim's Points**: According to the problem, Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
\[ \text{Jim's Points} = \text{Mike's Points} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 \]

- **Tony's Points**: According to the problem, Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
\[ \text{Tony's Points} = 2 \times \text{Mike's Points} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

So far, our breakdown looks like this:
- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 42 points

**Step 2: Calculate the number of points each player will receive in the fourth round**

- Each player receives one additional point.

- **Mike's New Total**: 
\[ 21 + 1 = 22 \]

- **Jim's New Total**: 
\[ 18 + 1 = 19 \]

- **Tony's New Total**: 
\[ 42 + 1 = 43 \]

**Step 3: Check if any player qualifies for an extra point based on their current total**

- **Mike's Current Total (after receiving the extra point)**: 22 points (which is not greater than 20)
- **Jim's Current Total (after receiving the extra point)**: 19 points (which is not greater than 20)
- **Tony's Current Total (after receiving the extra point)**: 43 points (which is greater than 20)

Since only Tony meets the condition of having more than 20 points, he gets another extra point.

**Step 4: Update Tony's total after the second extra point**

- **Tony's New Total (after receiving his second extra point)**:
\[ 43 + 1 = 44 \]

Now, let’s calculate the new total points for all three players:

- **Mike's New Total**: 22 points
- **Jim's New Total**: 19 points
- **Tony's New Total**: 44 points

Finally, add up the total points:

\[ \text{Total Points} = \text{Mike's Points} + \text{Jim's Points} + \text{Tony's Points} \]
\[ \text{Total Points} = 22 + 19 + 44 \]
\[ \text{Total Points} = 85 \]

Therefore, the total points that all three friends have after the extra points are distributed is **85**.<|im_end|>","After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.
Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 2 * 21 points = <<2*21=42>>42 points.
In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the age of the youngest son:**
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.

\[
\text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{\text{Oldest son's age}}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years}
\]

2. **Calculate how many oranges each son will wash:**
   - The oldest son (8 years old) will wash \(8\) oranges.
   - The youngest son (4 years old) will wash \(4\) oranges.

3. **Sum up the total number of oranges washed:**
   \[
   \text{Total oranges washed} = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

4. **Subtract the number of oranges washed from the initial amount:**
   - Will initially bought \(15\) oranges.
   - Subtracting the \(12\) oranges that were washed gives us:

\[
15 - 12 = 3
\]

Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is:

{The final answer is} 3 oranges.<|im_end|>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

<|im_start|>west
To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 5 people who eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily consumption per person:**
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are two meals per day.

   \[
   \text{Daily consumption per person} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weekly consumption per person:**
   - Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week.

   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption per person} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weekly consumption for all 5 people:**
   - Multiply the weekly consumption per person by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Total weekly consumption for 5 people} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/person/week} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

4. **Determine how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   - Divide the total amount of rice available by the total weekly consumption.

   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks if 5 people consume rice twice a day. {The final answer is} 3 weeks.<|im_end|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

- **Monday**: Closed (0 crates)
- **Tuesday**: Sold 15 crates
- **Wednesday**: Sold 12 crates
- **Thursday**: Sold 18 crates
- **Friday**: Sold 20 crates (since it's not mentioned as closed)

Total sales = 0 + 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates

Step 2: Compare the actual sales to the target.
Target: 120 crates
Actual sales: 65 crates

Step 3: Determine the difference between the actual sales and the target.
Difference = Target - Actual Sales = 120 - 65 = 55 crates

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week. The final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money the desk costs Carmen, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sequence of bids**: Since the bids increase by $50 each time and there are three additional bidders who also bid once at each level, the total number of bids will be the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money bid by Carmen**:
   - Carmen's first bid: $200
   - Each subsequent bid increases by $50.
   
   Let’s calculate the total amount bid by Carmen over all the levels:
   - First bid (Carmen): $200
   - Second bid (Carmen + Bidder A): $200 + $50 = $250
   - Third bid (Carmen + Bidder B): $250 + $50 = $300
   - Fourth bid (Carmen + Bidder C): $300 + $50 = $350
   
   So far, Carmen has spent $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

3. **Add up all the bids from the other participants**:
   - Bidder A: $200
   - Bidder B: $250
   - Bidder C: $300
   - Bidder D: $350
   
   Total for other participants = $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100.

4. **Summarize the total cost to Carmen**:
   - Total spent by Carmen: $1100
   - Total spent by others: $1100
   
   Therefore, the total cost to Carmen is $1100.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the desk costs Carmen a total of $1100.

{The final answer is} $1100.<|im_end|>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

                    question:
                    John hires a ? driving service to get him to work each day.  His ; work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day.  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 : weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 per , mile driven and he also gives , his driver a $150 bonus per . month.  How much does he . pay a year for driving?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven in a week
John drives to work and back home each day. The round trip distance is:
\[ \text{Distance one way} = 30 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 2 \times 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Since John works 5 days a week:
\[ \text{Total distance per week} = 5 \times 60 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance driven in a year
There are 50 weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Total distance per year} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of fuel (per mile)
John pays $2 per mile driven.
\[ \text{Cost per mile} = \$2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of fuel over the year
\[ \text{Total cost of fuel} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$30,000 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the annual bonus
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.
\[ \text{Number of months in a year} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Annual bonus} = \$150/month \times 12 \text{ months/year} = \$1,800 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total annual expense
\[ \text{Total annual expense} = \text{Total cost of fuel} + \text{Annual bonus} \]
\[ \text{Total annual expense} = \$30,000 + \$1,800 = \$31,800 \]

Therefore, John pays a total of **$31,800** per year for driving services.<|im_end|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week
So he pays 300*2=$<<300*2=600>>600 per week
That means he pays $600*50=$<<600*50=30000>>30000 a year for miles driven
He also gives $150*12=$<<150*12=1800>>1800 a year as a bonus to his driver
So he pays $30000+$1800=$<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 a year

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total exercise time from Monday and Sunday.
- **Monday**: Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
- **Sunday**: Peter exercised for 23 minutes.

Total time from Monday and Sunday:
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 23 \]

\[
= 49 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the desired total exercise time on Tuesday.
Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.

\[ \text{Desired Total} = 2 \times (\text{Time from Monday} + \text{Time from Sunday}) \]

Substitute the values we found in Step 1:

\[
\text{Desired Total} = 2 \times (16 + 23)
\]

\[
= 2 \times 49
\]

\[
= 98 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Find out how much more Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday.
We know he already has done 49 minutes.

Therefore, the additional minutes needed on Tuesday:

\[ \text{Additional Minutes Needed} = \text{Desired Total} - \text{Time from Monday and Sunday} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Additional Minutes Needed} = 98 - 49
\]

\[
= 49 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
Peter has to exercise for \(49\) minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.<|im_end|>","On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the structure of the folded tabloid
- The tabloid has two layers: a ""left"" layer (back) and a ""right"" layer (front).
- Each page is printed on one side only.

### Step 2: Determine how many pages fit on one side
- We need to determine how many pages will fit on one side before we can calculate the total number of sheets needed for the entire tabloid.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of pages that fit on one side
- For a 32-page tabloid:
  - On the left side (back), there are 16 pages.
  - On the right side (front), there are also 16 pages.

### Step 4: Confirm the total number of pages per side
- Since each sheet consists of two sides (left and right), we need half the number of pages for both sides combined.
- Therefore, for 16 pages on one side, we need 8 sheets.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of sheets required
- For 32 pages in total, we need 16 sheets.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much Annika spent on food and snacks.**

- Annika brought $50.
- She spent half of it on food and snacks.

First, calculate half of her total amount:
\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after spending on food and snacks.**

Subtract the amount spent on food and snacks from her initial amount:
\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

**Step 3: Add the cost of rides to the remaining amount.**

Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Calculate the total spent so far:
\[
25 (food) + 10 (rides) = 35
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the total spent from the original amount to find out how much is left.**

Subtract the total amount spent from her initial amount:
\[
50 - 35 = 15

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of books sold so far:**
   - The total number of books in the collection is 250.
   - Her sales have been going on for three years.
   - We know that her sales number this year is 45.

2. **Calculate the number of books sold in the first two years combined:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the first year.
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year (which is 45).
     Therefore, \( x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

3. **Verify the total number of books sold over all three years:**
   - Total books sold = Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the second year + Books sold in the third year
   - \( 90 + 45 + y = 250 \)
   - Simplify the equation: \( 135 + y = 250 \)
   - Solve for \( y \): \( y = 250 - 135 = 115 \)

4. **Confirm the number of unsold books:**
   - We are told there are currently 50 unsold books.

5. **Calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year:**
   - She sells each book for $20.
   - Number of books sold in the second year = 45.
   - Calculate earnings from the second year: 
     \[
     45 \text{ books} \times \$20 \text{ per book} = \$900
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is \(\boxed{\$900}\).<|im_end|>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.

To determine how much money Watson makes in April if the company performed very well for the entire month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Watson works in April.
2. Determine his earnings from working those hours.
3. Add his weekly bonus.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours worked in April.
- Watson works 10 hours/day for 5 days/week.
- Therefore, the total number of hours worked in April = \(10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours}\).

Step 2: Determine his earnings from working those hours.
- Watson earns $10/hour.
- Therefore, his earnings from working 50 hours = \(50 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500\).

Step 3: Add his weekly bonus.
- If the company performed very well, Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.
- Since he works 5 days a week, his total bonus for the month = \(3 \times \$300 = \$900\).

Now, let's add his regular earnings and bonus together to find out how much he made in April.

Regular earnings + Bonus = \$500 + \$900 = \$1400.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. The amount of money Watson made in April if the company performed very well for the whole month is \$1400.<|im_end|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the savings on one tub of ice cream.
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream = Original price - Discounted price
\[ \text{Savings per tub} = \$13 - \$11 = \$2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream.
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $2
- Number of tubs of ice cream to be bought: 2
- Total savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream = Savings per tub × Number of tubs
\[ \text{Total savings from 2 tubs} = \$2 \times 2 = \$4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the savings on one packet of milk.
- Original price of one packet of milk: Let's assume it costs $x
- Discount applied to one packet of milk: $0.5
- Savings per packet of milk = Original price - Discounted price
\[ \text{Savings per packet} = \$x - \$0.5 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total savings from buying 4 packets of milk.
- Savings per packet of milk: $\$x - \$0.5$
- Number of packets of milk to be bought: 4
- Total savings from buying 4 packets of milk = Savings per packet × Number of packets
\[ \text{Total savings from 4 packets} = (\$x - \$0.5) \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total savings from 4 packets} = 4(\$x - \$0.5) \]

### Final Answer:
Since we don't have the original price of the milk ($x), we can only calculate the savings based on the information provided.

If you know the original price of the milk, you can substitute that value in place of $x to find out the exact amount saved.

However, given the information provided, the total savings for buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk would be:

**The final answer is:** The total savings is $4.<|im_end|>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.
So the discount for 2 tubs of ice cream is $2 x 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
The total discount for 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $<<0.5*4=2>>2.
You will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum causes after 15 days, we need to consider the growth pattern of the arms and legs over time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of times the arm grows:**
   - Each day, the serum causes one more arm.
   - Over 15 days, the number of additional arms is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of arms} = 15 \times 1 = 15
     \]

2. **Determine the number of times the leg grows:**
   - Every 3 days, the serum causes one more leg.
   - To find out how many sets of 3 days there are in 15 days, divide 15 by 3:
     \[
     \frac{15}{3} = 5
     \]
   - So, the number of additional legs is:
     \[
     \text{Number of legs} = 5 \times 1 = 5
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of limbs grown:**
   - Add the number of arms and legs together:
     \[
     \text{Total limbs} = 15 \text{ (arms)} + 5 \text{ (legs)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total limbs} = 20
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After 15 days, the serum will have caused a person to grow 20 new limbs.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 20}}<|im_end|>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

                    question:
                    Theo , has $6000 he ; wishes to spend on his upcoming ; business trip to South ! Africa. He buys 6 business suits at ? $100 each, 3 suitcases at $50 each, a flight ticket that costs $700 more . than 5 ? times as much as the cost of a business suit.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on business suits.
- Cost per business suit = $100
- Number of business suits bought = 6

Total cost for business suits = \( 6 \times 100 = \$600 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of one suitcase.
- Cost per suitcase = $50

Total cost for all three suitcases = \( 3 \times 50 = \$150 \)

### Step 3: Determine the additional cost of the flight ticket.
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than five times the cost of a business suit.

First, calculate five times the cost of a business suit:
\[ 5 \times 100 = \$500 \]

Then add $700 to this amount:
\[ 500 + 700 = \$1200 \]

So, the flight ticket costs $1200.

### Step 4: Sum up all expenses so far.
- Business suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200

Total expenses so far = \( 600 + 150 + 1200 = \$1950 \)

### Step 5: Subtract the savings from the total expenses.
- Savings = $2000

Total remaining money after saving = \( 1950 - 2000 = -$550 \)

Since we're working backwards from the initial amount, it seems there was an error in the problem setup or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate:

### Corrected Calculation:
- Total amount Theo had initially = $6000

After buying the suits and suitcases, he should still be able to save $2000.

Thus, the correct calculation would be:
- Cost of business suits = $600
- Cost of suitcases = $150
- Cost of flight ticket (as calculated before) = $1200

Now, subtract these from the initial amount:
- Remaining money = $6000 - ($600 + $150 + $1200) = $6000 - $1950 = $4050

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$4050**<|im_end|>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.
Theo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.
Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

                    question:
                    In a family of 5, three people eat three eggs each day while the rest eat two eggs each day. If they eat eggs every day, . how many eggs will the family . consume in ; a week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the family over a period of one week.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of people eating 3 eggs per day:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day.
   
2. **Calculate the number of people eating 2 eggs per day:**
   - The remaining two people (5 - 3 = 2) eat 2 eggs each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the first group (3 people eating 3 eggs each):**
   - Number of people × Eggs per person = 3 × 3 = 9 eggs per day.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by the second group (2 people eating 2 eggs each):**
   - Number of people × Eggs per person = 2 × 2 = 4 eggs per day.

5. **Add the consumption from both groups to get the total daily egg consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption = 9 + 4 = 13 eggs per day.

6. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   - Number of days in a week × Daily consumption = 7 × 13 = 91 eggs per week.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 91 eggs.<|im_end|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.
So, 5 - 3 = <<5-3=2>>2 persons eat two eggs in a day.

So the family consumes 9 + 4 = <<9+4=13>>13 eggs each day.
Therefore, 13 x 7 = <<13*7=91>>91 eggs will be consumed by the family in a week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Noah's current age.
2. Calculate the population of Chile six years ago based on Noah’s age at that time.
3. Use the information about the population being twice Noah's age six years ago to find the current population.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine Noah's current age
Given that Noah is currently 46 years old (since he is half as old as Cera).

#### Step 2: Calculate the population of Chile six years ago
We know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. Let \( P \) be the population of Chile six years ago.

\[
P = 3000 \times \text{Noah's age six years ago}
\]

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, let's denote Cera's age six years ago as \( C \). We don't have direct information about Cera's age six years ago but can infer it from her current age:

\[
C = 2 \times \text{Noah's age six years ago}
\]

Let's assume Noah's age six years ago is \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\text{Noah's current age}}{2} = \frac{46}{2} = 23
\]

So, Noah was 23 years old six years ago.

Now, we calculate the population six years ago:

\[
P_{\text{six years ago}} = 3000 \times 23 = 69000
\]

This matches our assumption that the population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.

#### Step 3: Find the current population of Chile
Now, we use the given information that the population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.

\[
P_{\text{current}} = \frac{P_{\text{six years ago}}}{3000}
\]

Substituting the value calculated in Step 2:

\[
P_{\text{current}} = \frac{69000}{3000} = 230
\]

Therefore, the current population of Chile is **230**.<|im_end|>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.

If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.
Since the population of Chile was half what it was now six years ago, currently Chile has 60000*2 = <<60000*2=120000>>120000 people

                    : A football team has ! 105 members.  There are twice as many players on the offense as ! there is on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.  ; How many players are on the defense?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of players in different positions:

- Let \( D \) be the number of players on the defense.
- According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Since the total number of players on the team is 105, we can write the equation for the total number of players as follows:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation step-by-step.

First, combine like terms:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} \]

Next, find a common denominator to add these fractions:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So our equation now looks like:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}

To determine how many people will attend Martha's Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of invitees**

- There are 2 families with 6 people each.
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12
  \]
  
- There are 3 families with 4 people each.
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12
  \]

Adding both groups together gives us the total number of invitees:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

**Step 2: Adjust for those who can't come due to illness**

- 8 people couldn't come because of illness.
  \[
  24 - 8 = 16
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of people who have previous commitments**

- The problem states that \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining guests had previous commitments.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Subtract the number of people with previous commitments from the adjusted number of invitees**

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of marbles in the store:**
   - Solomon buys 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - The store already had 50 marbles.
   - Therefore, the initial total number of marbles in the store is \(50 + 20 = 70\).

2. **Marbles given by Solomon's father:**
   - Solomon's father gives him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
   - Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, his father gives him \(20 \times \frac{2}{5} = 8\) marbles.

3. **Total marbles after receiving more from his father:**
   - Adding the marbles given by his father to the initial total, we get \(70 + 8 = 78\) marbles.

4. **Weight calculation:**
   - Each marble weighs 2 kg.
   - The total weight of all the marbles is calculated by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight per marble.
   - So, the total weight is \(78 \times 2 = 156\) kg.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool:**
   - The pool has dimensions of 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.
   - The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the pool can be considered as) is given by:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet}
     \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   V = 6 \times 4 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   V = 24 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   V = 120 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost to fill the pool:**
   - The cost to fill the pool is $0.1 per cubic foot.
   - Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be found using the formula:
     \[
     C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have calculated:
     \[
     C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot}
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   C = 120 \times 0.1

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of girls in the classroom.
We know that there are 3 times as many girls as boys.

Given:
- Number of boys = 30

Let \( G \) represent the number of girls.

According to the given ratio:
\[ G = 3 \times \text{Number of Boys} \]

Substitute the number of boys into the equation:
\[ G = 3 \times 30 \]
\[ G = 90 \]

So, there are 90 girls in the classroom.

### Step 2: Determine the number of non-gendered children.
We know that there are \( \frac{1}{10} \) as many non-gendered children as boys.

Given:
- Number of boys = 30

Let \( N \) represent the number of non-gendered children.

According to the given ratio:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of Boys} \]

Substitute the number of boys into the equation:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 \]
\[ N = 3 \]

So, there are 3 non-gendered children in the classroom.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of children.
Now, add the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children together:
\[ \text{Total Children} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls} + \text{Number of Non-Gendered Children} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \text{Total Children} = 30 + 90 + 3 \]

Calculate the sum:
\[ \text{Total Children} = 123 \]

                    question:
                    The . ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the ! electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given ratio
We are given that the ratio of electric poles (P) to electric wires (W) is 1:3.

This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the ratio
Let \( P \) be the number of electric poles.
According to the ratio, \( W = 3P \).

### Step 3: Use the total number of wires provided
We are told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45.

So, we can write the equation as:
\[ P + W = 45 \]

Substitute \( W = 3P \) into the equation:
\[ P + 3P = 45 \]
\[ 4P = 45 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( P \)
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ P = \frac{45}{4} \]
\[ P = 11.25 \]

Since the number of poles must be a whole number, and typically poles cannot be fractional, we need to consider if this result makes sense in context or if there might have been a rounding error. However, based solely on the information given without additional context about how many poles can actually be installed, we would round down to the nearest whole number.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of poles
Given that we have 11.25 poles from our calculation, but considering practical constraints, we should recognize that in real-world scenarios, poles are often counted as full units regardless of fractional parts.

Therefore, the total number of poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is **11**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine the initial total number of people.
2. Calculate how many people left after one hour.
3. Find out how many people stayed in total.
4. Subtract the number of men who stayed from the total to find the number of women left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Initial Total Number of People
At the start of the party:
- Men: 25
- Women: 15
- Total: \( 25 + 15 = 40 \)

### Step 2: Calculate How Many People Left
After one hour, \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total number of people left. Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of people that left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Find Out How Many People Stayed
Since 10 people left, the remaining number of people is:
\[ \text{Total people - left} = 40 - 10 = 30 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the Number of Men Who Stayed From the Total to Find the Number of Women Left
We know that 22 men stayed at the party. Since all other people (both men and women) have left, the remaining people must be women only.
\[ \text{Number of women left} = \text{Total people left} - \text{Men who stayed} \]
\[ \text{Number of women left} = 30 - 22 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is **8**.<|im_end|>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.
After an hour, 40 people / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 people left the party.
This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.
Out of the 30 who stayed, 30 people - 22 men = <<30-22=8>>8 were women.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of pencils in each box.
2. Calculate the number of boxes needed for Jam's pencils.
3. Add the number of loose pencils to find the total number of pencils Jam has.
4. Calculate the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils.
5. Find the total number of boxes required for both Jam and Meg.

Step 1: Determine the number of pencils in each box.
Let's denote the number of pencils in each box as \( x \).

Since Jam has three boxes plus two loose pencils, the equation representing this is:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Step 2: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 24 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils.

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes needed for Jam's pencils.
Jam has 26 pencils, and each box contains 8 pencils. We divide the total number of Jam's pencils by the number of pencils per box:
\[ \frac{26}{8} = 3.25 \]
Since Jam cannot have a fraction of a box, she needs 4 boxes (because 3 boxes would only contain \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) pencils, leaving 2 pencils unaccounted for).

Step 4: Add the number of loose pencils to find the total number of pencils Jam has.
Jam also has 2 loose pencils.

Step 5: Calculate the number of boxes needed for Meg's pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils, and each box contains 8 pencils. We divide the total number of Meg's pencils by the number of pencils per box:
\[ \frac{46}{8} = 5.75 \]
Since Meg cannot have a fraction of a box, she needs 6 boxes (because 5 boxes would only contain \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) pencils, leaving 6 pencils unaccounted for).

Step 6: Find the total number of boxes required for both Jam and Meg.
Add the number of boxes needed for Jam and Meg:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg together need **10** boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]<|im_end|>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

Therefore, they need 72 / 8 = <<72/8=9>>9 boxes to put in all their pencils.

                    Shannon makes herself iced coffee by brewing hot coffee and ! adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also , weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when , it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds , 15 milliliters , of cream?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>sys
To solve this problem, we need to account for two main factors that reduce the strength of the coffee: the cooling effect from the ice cubes and the weakening effect of any added liquids.

Let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total temperature reduction due to ice cubes.
- Each ice cube reduces the temperature by 13 degrees Celsius.
- Shannon adds 15 milliliters (ml) of cream, which also reduces the temperature by an unknown amount \( x \) degrees Celsius.

Given that the total temperature reduction is 65 degrees Celsius, we can set up the equation:
\[ 13n + x = 65 \]
where \( n \) is the number of ice cubes.

### Step 2: Determine the number of ice cubes needed.
Since each ice cube reduces the temperature by 13 degrees Celsius, we divide the total temperature reduction by 13:
\[ n = \frac{65}{13} \approx 5 \]

So, Shannon has approximately 5 ice cubes.

### Step 3: Calculate the weakening factor due to the added cream.
- The cream weakens the coffee by \( x \) degrees Celsius per ml.
- Shannon adds 15 ml of cream.

We don't know the exact value of \( x \), but since we're asked about the overall weakening effect after all these additions, we'll assume the cream alone doesn't significantly affect the total weakening factor based on the given information.

### Step 4: Combine the effects.
Now, let's combine the effects of the ice cubes and the cream to find out how much the coffee is weakened in total.

From Step 2, we have:
\[ 13n + x = 65 \]
Substituting \( n = 5 \):
\[ 13(5) + x = 65 \]
\[ 65 + x = 65 \]
This means:
\[ x = 0 \]

However, if we consider the added cream does weaken the coffee by some factor, we would need more information to determine the exact amount.

### Conclusion:
Since the cream doesn't significantly change the overall weakening factor, we conclude that the coffee is weakened by \( x \) degrees Celsius where \( x = 0 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the Trade Rule**:
   - For every 2 old records traded, you get 1 new record.

2. **Determine the Total Number of New Records**:
   - The total number of new records given away to the traders is 7.

3. **Set up an equation based on the trade rule**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pairs of old records traded.
   - According to the rule, trading \( x \) pairs gives \( \frac{x}{2} \) new records (since each pair yields 1 new record).

4. **Relate the number of pairs to the total number of new records**:
   - We know that trading \( x \) pairs results in 7 new records.
   - Therefore, we have: 
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 7
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = 14
     \]
   - This means there were 14 pairs of old records traded.

6. **Convert pairs back to individual records**:
   - Since each pair consists of 2 old records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is:
     \[
     14 \times 2 = 28
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of junior programmers:**
   - The total number of employees is 100.
   - The number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

2. **Calculate the number of senior programmers:**
   - Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers,
   
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

3. **Calculate the monthly salary for each type of programmer:**
   - Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.
   - Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so their salary is:

\[
\text{Salary of senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
\]

4. **Calculate the total monthly salary for junior programmers:**
   - There are 40 junior programmers, so their total monthly salary is:

\[
\text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000
\]

5. **Calculate the total monthly salary for senior programmers:**
   - There are 60 senior programmers, so their total monthly salary is:

\[
\text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000
\]

6. **Add the salaries together to find the total amount of money the company pays to all programmers per month:**

\[
\text{Total amount of money paid per month} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000

- Since the cell phone starts at 60%, it needs to reach 100% (or full charge).

Step 3: Calculate the number of percentage points still needed.
- Current charge = 60%
- Full charge required = 100%
- Percentage points still needed = 100% - 60% = 40%

Step 4: Calculate the time required to achieve the remaining charge.
- We know that the cell phone gains 1 percentage point every 3 minutes.
- To find out how many 3-minute intervals are needed to gain 40 percentage points, divide the total percentage points needed by the number of percentage points gained per interval.
- Time required = (Percentage points needed / Percentage points gained per interval) * Interval length (in minutes)

Step 5: Perform the calculation.
- Time required = (40 / 1) * (3/60)
- Simplify: Time required = 40 * (1/20) hours
- Time required = 2 hours

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the cell phone.<|im_end|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.
Then 40*3=<<40*3=120>>120 minutes to fully charge.

                    : A customer’s loyalty card at a store gives them rewards of $1 off their next ! purchase for every $20 they spend. Their last shopping trip, ? they spent $80. !

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much the customer paid in total after applying all discounts, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of times the customer can use the reward program.
The reward program allows a discount of $1 off for every $20 spent.

- Total spending = $80
- Number of times the $20 threshold is met: \( \frac{80}{20} = 4 \)

So, the customer will receive 4 rewards (since each time he spends over $20, he gets one reward).

### Step 2: Calculate the total value of the rewards.
Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase, so for 4 rewards, the total value is:
\[ 4 \times \$1 = \$4 \]

This means the customer will get a discount of $4 on his next purchase because he has already spent $80.

### Step 3: Determine the cost before applying any coupons or additional discounts.
After using the rewards, the customer's effective spending is reduced by the value of the rewards ($4). So, the effective spending now becomes:
\[ \$80 - \$4 = \$76 \]

### Step 4: Apply the coupon.
The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards from the current spending. Since the customer got $4 worth of rewards back, the coupon will take off twice that amount, which is:
\[ 2 \times \$4 = \$8 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the coupon from the effective spending.
Now, subtract the coupon from the remaining spending after accounting for the rewards:
\[ \$76 - \$8 = \$68 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the customer pays a total of **$68** on this shopping trip.<|im_end|>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.

### Job A:
- **Hourly Wage**: $15/hour
- **Hours per Year**: 2000 hours/year
- **Total Annual Salary**: \( 15 \times 2000 = \$30,000 \)

### State Tax Rate (Job A):
- **State Tax Rate**: 20%
- **Net Pay After Tax**:
\[ \text{Net Pay} = \frac{\$30,000}{(1 - 0.20)} = \frac{\$30,000}{0.80} = \$37,500 \]

### Property Tax:
- **Property Tax**: $6,000
- **Tax on Net Income**:
\[ \text{Net Income Before Tax} = \$37,500 \]
\[ \text{Property Tax on Net Income} = \$37,500 \times 0.10 = \$3,750 \]

### Total Income After Taxes:

### Job B:
- **Annual Salary**: $42,000
- **State Tax Rate**: 10%
- **Property Tax**: $6,000
- **Tax on Net Income**:
\[ \text{Net Income Before Tax} = \$42,000 - \$6,000 = \$36,000 \]

### Tax on Net Income:
\[ \text{Tax on Net Income} = \$36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600 \]

### Total Income After Taxes:
- **Income After Property Tax**:
\[ \text{After Property Tax} = \$36,000 - \$6,000 = \$30,000 \]

### Final Net Pay for Job B:
- **Final Net Pay**:
\[ \text{Final Net Pay} = \$30,000 \]

### Comparison of Net Pay:
- **Difference in Net Pay**:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ruined castles:**
   - We know that 40% of the total castles are ruins.
   - Total castles = 220
   
   So, the number of ruined castles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of ruined castles} = 0.40 \times 220
   \]
   
   Let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   0.40 \times 220 = 88
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:**
   - We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Number of ruined castles = 88
   
   Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles is:
   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = \frac{1}{2} \times 88
   \]
   
   Let's perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44

To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost from Furniture United's offer.
- Advance payment: $1,350
- Monthly installment: $350
- Number of months: 6

Total cost from Furniture United's offer = Advanced payment + (Monthly installment × Number of months)
= $1,350 + ($350 × 6)
= $1,350 + $2,100
= $3,450

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost from Cozy Homes' offer.
- Advance payment: $1,100
- Monthly installment: $250
- Number of months: 9

Total cost from Cozy Homes' offer = Advanced payment + (Monthly installment × Number of months)
= $1,100 + ($250 × 9)
= $1,100 + $2,250
= $3,350

### Step 3: Determine the cost difference between the two offers.
Cost difference = Total cost from Furniture United's offer - Total cost from Cozy Homes' offer
= $3,450 - $3,350
= $100

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is **$100**.<|im_end|>","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of guns:**
   - DJ has 8 guns.
   - Nick has 10 guns.
   - RJ (Richard) has 1 gun.
   - Jason doesn't have any information provided about his guns.

2. **Calculate the total number of guns available:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of guns} = 8 (\text{DJ}) + 10 (\text{Nick}) + 1 (\text{RJ}) = 19 \text{ guns}
   \]

3. **Determine how many guns each person will get if shared equally:**
   - There are 4 people sharing the guns.
   - To find out how many guns each person gets, divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
   \[
   \text{Guns per person} = \frac{\text{Total number of guns}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{19}{4} = 4.75
   \]

Therefore, after sharing the guns equally among the four friends, each person would have approximately 4.75 guns. Since you can't split a gun into fractions in practical terms, we can conclude that each person would receive 4 full guns, and there might be some leftover guns depending on how exactly they decide to distribute or manage the remaining one gun. However, for equal distribution without considering fractional parts, each person would end up with 4.75 guns.<|im_end|>","The total number of guns is 8+10+1+5=<<8+10+1+5=24>>24 guns.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar required for both the batches of suckers and fudge.

### Step 1: Calculate the sugar needed for the batches of suckers.
Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar per batch of suckers. He wants to make 8 batches of suckers.

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Sugar per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 30 \, \text{ounces/batch} \times 8 \, \text{batches}
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 240 \, \text{ounces}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the sugar needed for the batch of fudge.
Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar per batch of fudge. He wants to make 1 batch of fudge.

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Sugar per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}

To determine the final value of Maria's shares, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial total cost:**
   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Cost} = 8 \times \$8 = \$64
   \]

2. **Determine the new stock price after a 50% increase:**
   - The stock price increases by 50%, so the new price is:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + (\$8 \times 0.5) = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Calculate the value of the shares after the increase:**
   - Maria holds onto the shares until the end of the first year, so the value remains at the increased price.
   \[
   \text{Value After Increase} = \$12 \times 8 = \$96

4. **Determine the new stock price after a 25% decrease:**
   - The stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$12 - (\$12 \times 0.25) = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]

5. **Calculate the value of the shares after the decrease:**
   - Since Maria still has the same number of shares (8), the final value of her shares is:

   - Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
   - Thomas ate three times as many hot dogs as Luke.
   \[
   \text{Thomas' hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6

2. **Calculate the number of hot dogs John ate:**
   - John ate half the amount Thomas ate.
   \[
   \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{\text{Thomas' hot dogs}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:**
   - We subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate.
   \[
   \text{More hot dogs John ate} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1

We know the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the largest group has 70 students. Since each of the two smaller groups has the same number of students, they also have 70 students each.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 70 students.<|im_end|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

                    question:
                    Farmer Brown has 60 ; animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. He has twice ; as many chickens as cows. How many legs do ; the animals have, all together?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chickens and cows Farmer Brown has and then calculate their total leg count.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that there are 60 animals in total.
     \[
     c + k = 60
     \]
   - We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.
     \[
     c = 2k
     \]

3. **Solve for One Variable Using the Other Equation:**
   Substitute \( c = 2k \) into the first equation:
   \[
   2k + k = 60
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3k = 60
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   k = 20
   \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   Substitute \( k = 20 \) back into \( c = 2k \):
   \[
   c = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of chicken legs is:
   \[
   40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 \text{ legs per chicken} = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]
   Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of cow legs is:
   \[
   20 \text{ cows} \times 4 \text{ legs per cow} = 80 \text{ legs}
   \]
   Add the legs from chickens and cows:
   \[
   80 \text{ (chicken legs)} + 80 \text{ (cow legs)} = 160 \text{ legs}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The total number of legs of all the animals on Farmer Brown's farm is \( \boxed{160} \).<|im_end|>","There are 60*(2/3)=<<60*(2/3)=40>>40 chickens.

                    question:
                    Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.

With a sigh, Josh starts to . juggle on stage with how many . balls?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of balls**: Josh starts with 3 balls.
2. **Increase per week**: Each week, he adds 1 more ball.
3. **Weeks passed**:
   - Week 1: Add 1 ball (total = 4)
   - Week 2: Add 1 ball (total = 5)
   - Week 3: Add 1 ball (total = 6)
   - Week 4: Add 1 ball (total = 7)

So after the end of the fourth week, Josh has 7 balls.

4. **Drop incident**: When Josh steps on stage, he drops 3 balls, which are caught by the audience. This means he loses 3 balls.
5. **Lost balls**: Since 2 out of the dropped balls were caught, Josh still has 1 ball left that got lost completely due to the darkness inside the auditorium.

Therefore, the total number of balls Josh has before slipping and dropping any is 7. 

Since he dropped 3 balls, we need to subtract those from the initial count of 7:
\[ \text{Final count} = 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Thus, after the drop incident, Josh has 4 balls remaining.

To find the final answer, we add the balls he had left after the drop incident back into his current total:
\[ \text{Total balls} = 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Hence, the final answer is: The final answer is 7 balls.<|im_end|>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7

                    question:
                    A pink frog weighs the same . as a blue beetle, the same , as a green toad, , 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal based on the given information and then sum up their individual weights along with the weight of the container.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Pink Frog Weight**:
   - The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Blue Beetle Weight**:
   - The blue beetle has the same weight as the pink frog.
   - Therefore, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Green Toad Weight**:
   - The green toad has the same weight as the blue beetle.
   - Thus, the green toad also weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Yellow Snake Weight**:
   - The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog.
   - Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the yellow snake's weight can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weight of yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Red Bird Weight**:
   - The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the yellow snake.
   - Given that the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds, the red bird's weight is:
     \[
     \text{Weight of red bird} = 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ pounds}
     \]

6. **Container Weight**:
   - The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

7. **Total Weight Calculation**:
   - We now add the weights of all the animals (pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, red bird) together, plus the weight of the container.
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + \text{Weight of blue beetle} + \text{Weight of green toad} + \text{Weight of yellow snake} + \text{Weight of red bird} + \text{Weight of container}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 40 + 20 = 290 \text{ pounds}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{290 \text{ pounds}}
\]<|im_end|>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

To determine how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of outfits at the baby shower**

Laurel received 24 baby outfits from her friend.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower**

At the baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount she originally had. Since she had 24 outfits, receiving twice this amount would be:

\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

So, Laurel received an additional 48 outfits at the baby shower.

**Step 3: Add the outfits from both occasions**

Adding the outfits from the shower to the original 24 outfits:

\[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]

Therefore, Laurel now has 72 outfits after the baby shower.

**Step 4: Include the gifts from her mom**

Her mother gave her 15 more outfits. Adding these to the total from Step 3:

\[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

Thus, Laurel now has a total of 87 outfits for her baby.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: 87 outfits.<|im_end|>","Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the daily increase in running distance:**
   - Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day.
   - The coach suggests running 1/5 times more than usual.
   - Calculate 1/5 of 5000 meters:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
     \]

2. **Calculate the new daily running distance:**
   - Add the increased distance to the original distance:

     6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Convert the total distance from meters to kilometers (if needed):**
   - There are 1000 meters in a kilometer:
     \[
     \frac{180000}{1000} = 180 \text{ kilometers}

To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week**

Jenny buys 1 bag per week.
- Each bag contains 36 cookies.

\[
\text{Total cookies bought} = 1 \times 36 = 36 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunchbox weekly**

Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunchbox every 5 days.

First, find out how many weeks there are in 5 days:

\[
\frac{5 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714 \text{ (rounded down to 0 since only whole weeks count)}
\]

Since she can't buy a fraction of a bag, she uses the entire bag on 0 full weeks.

Now calculate the cookies put into the lunchbox:

\[
\text{Cookies put into lunchbox} = 0 \times 4 = 0 \text{ cookies}

**Step 3: Determine the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week**

Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days.

\[
\text{Cookies eaten by husband} = 7 \times 1 = 7 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining cookies after accounting for her son's lunchbox and her husband’s consumption**

Subtract the cookies used from the total cookies bought:

\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = 36 - 0 - 7 = 29 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Final Step: Subtract the cookies eaten by her husband from the remaining cookies**

Subtract the cookies eaten by her husband from the remaining cookies:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total original price of the shirts.
2. Determine the discount amount.
3. Subtract the discount from the original total price.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total original price of the shirts
Davos bought 2 shirts at $30 each. So, the total original price is:
\[ \text{Total Original Price} = 2 \times \$30 = \$60 \]

### Step 2: Determine the discount amount
A 40% discount on the total original price means Davos gets a discount equivalent to 40% of $60. We can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original total price
Now, we subtract the discount amount from the total original price to find out how much Davos paid after the discount:
\[ \text{Amount Paid} = \$60 - \$24 = \$36 \]

So, Davos paid a total of $\$36$ for the two shirts.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, , they sell 5 silos a day, . and make $220 per silo. . What percentage more ? are they making per day now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the percentage increase in profit per day, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate daily sales revenue for tractors**
- Tractors sold per day: 10
- Revenue per tractor: $100
- Total revenue from tractors per day = \( 10 \times 100 \)

\[ \text{Total revenue from tractors} = 1000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate total revenue for silos**
- Silos sold per day: 5
- Revenue per silo: $220
- Total revenue from silos per day = \( 5 \times 220 \)

\[ \text{Total revenue from silos} = 1100 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total daily revenue before and after changes**

Before changing:
\[ \text{Total daily revenue (before)} = 1000 + 1100 = 2100 \]

After changing:
\[ \text{Total daily revenue (after)} = 1100 + 2100 = 3200 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the change in total daily revenue**

Change in revenue = Final revenue - Initial revenue

\[ \Delta \text{Revenue} = 3200 - 2100 = 1100 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the percentage increase in revenue**

Percentage increase = \( \frac{\Delta \text{Revenue}}{\text{Initial Revenue}} \times 100 \)

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1100}{2100} \right) \times 100 \approx 52.38\% \]

                    Every month, ; Madeline has to buy food, treats, . and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine costs $100 per month. How much money does Madeline spend on her dog per ? year if there ! are 4 weeks in a month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down the expenses into weekly and monthly components.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Weekly Expenses:**
   - **Food:** Cost per week = $25
   - **Treats:** Cost per month = $20
     Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month (implied from the information that there are 4 weeks in a month), we can calculate the weekly cost of treats.
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost of treats} = \frac{\$20}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \$5 \text{ per week}
     \]
   - **Medicine:** Cost per month = $100
     Similarly, calculate the weekly cost of medicine.
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost of medicine} = \frac{\$100}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \$25 \text{ per week}
     \]

2. **Total Weekly Expense:**
   - Sum up all the weekly expenses.
   \[
   \text{Total weekly expense} = \text{Food} + \text{Treats} + \text{Medicine} = \$25 + \$5 + \$25 = \$35
   \]

3. **Annual Expenses Calculation:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Multiply the total weekly expense by the number of weeks in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total annual expense} = \$35 \times 52 = \$1820
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year is $\boxed{1820}$.<|im_end|>","Madeline spends$25*4=$<<25*4=100>>100 on food for her dog per month.

To determine how many hours Peyton's after-work activities will take in total, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class on Monday:**
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - Total time: 1 hour

2. **Cooking Class on Tuesday:**
   - Duration: \(3 \times\) (Duration of Yoga Class on Monday)
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Total time: 3 hours

3. **Cheese-Tasting Event on Wednesday:**
   - Duration: 0.5 hour
   - Total time: 0.5 hours

4. **Museum Tour on Thursday:**
   - Duration: \( \frac{1}{2} \) (Duration of Cooking Class on Tuesday)
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Total time: 1.5 hours

5. **Errands on Friday:**
   - Duration: 2 hours
   - Total time: 2 hours

Now, let's add up the durations:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of pot pots for roses**
April asks for 30 pot pots for the daisies.
Twice that amount would be required for the roses.

Number of rose pot pots = 2 × 30 = 60

**Step 2: Calculate total number of pot pots needed**
Total needed = Pot pots for daisies + Pot pots for roses
                = 30 + 60 = 90

**Step 3: Subtract the number of pot pots already purchased**
April has already bought 100 pot pots from the garden center.

Pot pots remaining = Total needed - Pot pots purchased
                  = 90 - 100 = -10

Since we cannot have negative pot pots, it means April doesn't have enough pot pots to meet her needs.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} -10

This indicates that April runs out of pot pots before she can buy the necessary ones for both types of flowers. She will need to go back to the garden center or find additional sources to acquire the missing pot pots.<|im_end|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent and given away
Andrea spent the remaining money on an $11 sweater and gave her brother $4.

- Total spent on sweater: $11
- Total given to brother: $4
- Total spent = $11 + $4 = $15

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent or saved
We know that after these expenditures, Andrea still has $36 left.

Let \( S \) represent the savings Andrea made before spending any money.

So, we have:
\[ S + (S - \$15) = \$36 \]

Here, \( S - \$15 \) represents the money left after buying the sweater and giving to her brother.

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
\[ S + S - \$15 = \$36 \]
\[ 2S - \$15 = \$36 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( S \)
Add \$15 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = \$36 + \$15 \]
\[ 2S = \$51 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{\$51}{2} \]
\[ S = \$25.50 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Andrea saved $25.50.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $25.50.<|im_end|>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

                    question:
                    John decides to do several activities while out on vacation.  He spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming.  He also watched : 3 , different shows ; which were 2 hours each.  This was 30% of ? the time he spent.  He spent , 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on activities other than sightseeing:**

   - Time spent boating: 6 hours
   - Time spent swimming: Half of the boat time = \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours
   - Total time for swimming: 3 hours (as given)

   Adding these together gives us the total time spent on non-sightseeing activities:
   \[
   6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the total time spent watching shows:**

   - Number of shows watched: 3
   - Duration of each show: 2 hours
   - Total time spent on shows: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

3. **Find the total time spent on all activities except sightseeing:**

   - Non-sightseeing time: 9 hours
   - Shows time: 6 hours
   - Total non-sightseeing time: \( 9 + 6 = 15 \) hours

4. **Verify if the total non-sightseeing time represents 70% of the total time spent on all activities:**

   Given that the total time spent on all activities is 15 hours, we need to check if 15 hours represent 70% of the total time.
   
   If 15 hours are indeed 70%, then the total time spent on all activities should be:
   \[
   \frac{15}{0.7} \approx 21.43 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   However, since we're not sure about the accuracy here, let's move forward assuming the provided information is correct.

5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**

   - Sightseeing time: 40% of total time
   - Let the total time be \( T \)
   - Then, sightseeing time = \( 0.4T \)

   Since we have already calculated that the total time spent on all activities including sightseeing is approximately 21.43 hours, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.4T = 21.43
   \]

   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{21.43}{0.4} \approx 53.58 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total time John spent sightseeing is approximately **53.58 hours**.<|im_end|>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming

     \text{Earnings} = \$10 \times 20 \text{ hours} = \$200
     \]
   - Second job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = \$5 \times 15 \text{ hours} = \$75

   \]

4. **Determine if Annabelle's total earnings cover this amount:**
   \[
   \$275 < \$320

To determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases and the additional gift from his mother, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on toys.**

- **Toy Cars**: 
  - Number purchased: 6
  - Cost per car: $2
  - Total for toy cars = \( 6 \times 2 = \$12 \)

- **Teddy Bears**: 
  - Number purchased: 5
  - Cost per bear: $1
  - Total for teddy bears = \( 5 \times 1 = \$5 \)

- **Total Amount Spent**:
  - \( \$12 (toy cars) + \$5 (teddy bears) = \$17 \)

**Step 2: Add the initial $28 given by Dean's mother.**

- Initial amount given by mother: $28
- Additional $10 given by mother: $10

- **Total Amount Given by Mother**:
  - \( \$28 (initial amount) + \$10 (additional gift) = \$38 \)

**Step 3: Subtract the total amount spent from the total amount given by the mother.**

- Total amount given by mother: $38
- Total amount spent: $17

- **Final Calculation**:
  - Money left = \( \$38 (total given) - \$17 (spent) = \$21 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $21.<|im_end|>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.

- **Total cost for friends playing mini-golf** = \( 5x \) (since there are \( x \) friends).
- **Go-Karts**: The total cost for \( x \) friends riding the go-karts at $10 each = \( 10x \).

So, the total amount spent on these activities is:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5x + 10x = 15x \]

### Step 3: Determine Remaining Budget
Morgan initially has $90. After spending on activities, she will have:
\[ \text{Remaining Budget} = 90 - 15x \]

We know that Morgan still needs more than $5 in arcade tokens. Therefore, let's set up an inequality based on the remaining budget:
\[ 90 - 15x > 5 \]

### Step 4: Solve the Inequality
Subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ 85 - 15x > 0 \]
Divide both sides by -15 (remembering to reverse the inequality sign):
\[ x < \frac{85}{15} \]
Simplify the fraction:
\[ x < \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67 \]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, the maximum possible value for \( x \) is 5.

### Conclusion
Morgan can invite up to 5 friends to her birthday party while staying within her budget. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{5}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate daily spending on lollipops:**
   - Marisa spends $0.25 per lollipop.
   - She buys 4 lollipops each day.

   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 4 \times 0.25 = \$1.00
   \]

2. **Determine total savings over 5 days:**
   - Each day, she saves the change left after buying lollipops.
   - Since she starts with $5 and spends $1 each day, we need to find out how many dollars she has left after 5 days.

   \[
   \text{Total spent in 5 days} = 5 \times 1 = \$5.00
   \]
   
3. **Calculate remaining amount in her piggy bank after 5 days:**
   - Starting with $5, subtract the total spent ($5) from the initial amount.

   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 5 - 5 = \$0
   \]

Therefore, after saving for 5 days, Marisa puts $\boxed{0}$ into her piggy bank.<|im_end|>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

                    question:
                    Billy is buying ; some candy with $10 his : father gave him. The candy costs $1.5 a pound. After buying candy, he takes half his change : and spends it on gumballs, which cost $.05 each. If he bought 40 ! gumballs, how many pounds of candy did he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on candy**

- Billy has $10.
- He buys candy for $1.5 per pound.

Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys. 

The equation representing the total cost of the candy is:
\[ 1.5x = \$10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{10}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 6.67 \] (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Billy buys approximately 6.67 pounds of candy.

**Step 2: Determine the amount of change Billy gets from his father**

Billy had $10 initially, so the amount of change after spending money on candy is:
\[ \$10 - (\$1.5 \times 6.67) \]

Calculate the change:
\[ \$10 - \$10.005 = -\$0.005 \]

Since he cannot have negative change in practical terms, we need to consider the remainder after rounding up or down. However, for simplicity, let's assume he receives exactly $0.005 back.

**Step 3: Calculate how much change Billy spends on gumballs**

Billy has $0.005 left as change. He spends this on gumballs at $0.05 each.

Number of gumballs he can buy:
\[ \text{Number of gumballs} = \frac{\$0.005}{\$0.05/\text{gum}} \]

Calculate the number of gumballs:
\[ \text{Number of gumballs} = \frac{0.005}{0.05} \]
\[ \text{Number of gumballs} = 0.1 \]

Since he cannot buy partial gumballs practically, we round down to the nearest whole number.

**Step 4: Verify the total number of gumballs purchased**

Billy buys 40 gumballs, but since he only has enough change to buy 0.1 gumball, it seems there might be an inconsistency. Let's re-evaluate if he could actually buy 40 gumballs with the remaining change.

Given that he has no more than 0.1 gumball left, he would not be able to buy 40 gumballs. Therefore, the number of gumballs he can realistically purchase with the given change is 0.

**Conclusion**

Based on the calculations, Billy does not have enough change to buy 40 gumballs with the remaining $0.005. Hence, the initial assumption about the amount of change was incorrect. 

However, if we were to strictly follow the original conditions without considering practical limitations:

Billy buys approximately **6.67 pounds** of candy. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6.67}
\] pounds of candy.<|im_end|>","He spent $2 on gumballs because 40 x .05 = <<40*.05=2>>2

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. Let's denote the current age of Carver as \( C \).
2. According to the problem, Carver turns 45, so his current age \( C = 45 \).

3. The problem states that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically as: 
   \[
   C = 2S - 5
   \]
   where \( S \) represents the son's current age.

4. Substitute \( C = 45 \) into the equation:
   \[
   45 = 2S - 5
   \]

5. Solve for \( S \):
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2S
   \]
   \[
   50 = 2S
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{50}{2}

   \[
   S = 25

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the train and then determine how often it needs to be serviced based on those distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance for one round trip**

- Distance from City 1 to City 2 = 75 miles
- Distance from City 2 to City 3 = 100 miles
- Distance from City 3 back to City 1 = (100 - 50) miles = 50 miles (since it's 50 miles less than the combined distance)

Total distance for one round trip = 75 + 100 + 50 = **225 miles**

**Step 2: Determine the number of trips per day**

The train makes one complete round trip in one day. Since there are 3 trips made in one day:

Number of trips per day = 3

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered in one day**

Since each round trip covers 225 miles:

Distance covered in one day = 225 miles/trip × 3 trips/day = **675 miles/day**

**Step 4: Determine the total distance covered over time**

Let \( T \) be the total travel time in days. Given that the train needs to cover 18,000 miles before needing service:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 675 \text{ miles/day} \times T \]

We know the total distance must equal 18,000 miles:

\[ 675T = 18000 \]

Solve for \( T \):

\[ T = \frac{18000}{675} \]
\[ T = 26.67 \]

So, the train will go between services after approximately **26.67 days**. Since the number of days cannot be fractional, you would consider 27 full days as a practical limit if not explicitly required to round up or down depending on specific operational rules.<|im_end|>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

To determine how much stuffing Mark needs to make the specified number of beds, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 chihuahuas:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - Number of chihuahuas = 4
   
   \[
   \text{Total stuffing for chihuahuas} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total stuffing needed for 3 collies:**
   - The average amount of stuffing required for a collie bed is the average of what is needed for a Rottweiler (8 pounds) and a chihuahua (2 pounds).
   
   First, find the average:
   
   \[
   \text{Average stuffing per collie} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   
   Now, calculate the total stuffing for 3 collies:
   
   \[
   \text{Total stuffing for collies} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Add the stuffing needed for both types of dogs together:**
   
   \[
   \text{Total stuffing needed} = 8 \text{ pounds (for chihuahuas)} + 15 \text{ pounds (for collies)} = 23 \text{ pounds}

To determine how long John's trip took, we need to break it down into two parts: the time spent on the detoured trip to his friend's house, and the time spent driving back home.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the detoured trip

- Distance to John's friend's house = 200 miles
- Speed during this trip = 70 mph

Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{200}{70} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the return trip

- Distance from John's friend's house to home = 240 miles
- Speed during this trip = 80 mph

Again using the same formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}}
\]

Calculate:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Add the times together

Total time taken for the entire trip:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{return}}
\]

Substitute in the values calculated:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 2.857 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Add these values:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 5.857 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total time John's trip took is approximately **5.857 hours**.<|im_end|>","The first leg was 200+10=<<200+10=210>>210 miles

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fourth-grade boys were present at Small Tree School on Friday. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of fourth-grade students:**
   - There are 96 fourth-graders in total.

2. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade girls:**
   - We know that 43 fourth-graders are girls.
   
3. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys:**
   - Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96 and there are 43 girls, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
     \]

4. **Determine the number of fourth-grade boys who were absent on Friday:**
   - On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls were absent.
   - Additionally, 0.4 fourth-grade boys were absent (since the decimal point is not specified, we assume it means 0.4).

5. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys who were present on Friday:**
   - Subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present} = \text{Total number of boys} - \text{Number of boys absent}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of boys present} = 53 - 0.4 = 52.6
     \]

Since the number of boys must be an integer, we round 52.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 53.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 53 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday.<|im_end|>","Of the 96 fourth graders, 43 are girls, so 96 students - 43 girls = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.

                    question:
                    3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for ; shoplifting.  Three . times the number of , shoplifters , were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of : 50 people ? were kicked out of the Walmart, how many were kicked out for other reasons?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers who refused to wear masks.
   - The number of customers who refused to wear masks is given as 3.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, three customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, so \( x = 3 \).

3. **Calculate the Number of Shoplifters:**
   The problem states that the number of customers who refused to wear masks is four times that many minus five. Since \( x = 3 \), we can calculate the number of shoplifters using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of shoplifters} = 4x - 5
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   \text{Number of shoplifters} = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Physical Violence Kicks Out:**
   The problem also says that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So:
   \[
   \text{Number of physical violence kicks out} = 3 \times (\text{Number of shoplifters})
   \]
   Substituting \( \text{Number of shoplifters} = 7 \):
   \[
   \text{Number of physical violence kicks out} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Sum All Kickouts:**
   To find the total number of kickouts, sum all the numbers calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total kickouts} = x + \text{Number of shoplifters} + \text{Number of physical violence kicks out}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total kickouts} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31
   \]

6. **Determine Other Reasons Kickouts:**
   Given that the total number of kickouts is 50, subtract the number of physical violence kicks out from the total kickouts:
   \[
   \text{Other reasons kickouts} = \text{Total kickouts} - \text{Physical violence kicks out}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Other reasons kickouts} = 50 - 21 = 29
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]<|im_end|>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

                    question:
                    After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more , points than Sara, who scored 8. . How many points did Erin have before?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Erin scores 14 points.
- Erin has three times as many points as Sara.
- Sara scored 8 points.

### Step 2: Determine how many points Sara would need to score to be three times Erin's score
Since Erin currently has 14 points, we can set up an equation where \( S \) represents the number of points Sara needs to score:
\[ 3S = 14 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( S \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ S = \frac{14}{3} \]
\[ S \approx 4.67 \]

Since Sara cannot score a fraction of a point in this context, we round up to the nearest whole number:
\[ S = 5 \]

So, Sara must have scored 5 points to be exactly three times Erin's current score (which is 14).

### Step 4: Calculate how many points Erin had initially
Erin’s total score after scoring 14 points is 29 points (since \( 14 + 14 = 28 \)). To find out how many points she had initially, subtract the additional points from her total score:
\[ Initial\ Points\ (Erin) = Total\ Score - Additional\ Points \]
\[ Initial\ Points\ (Erin) = 28 - 14 \]
\[ Initial\ Points\ (Erin) = 14 \]

Therefore, Erin had 14 points before scoring the 14 points that brought her total to 28 points.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
The final answer is: 14 points<|im_end|>","Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.
This means Erin has a total of 8+24 = <<8+24=32>>32 points now.
Before, Erin had 32-14= <<32-14=18>>18 points

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine the total amount spent on the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost for each type of gift separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for picture frames
- Number of seniors = 44
- Cost per picture frame = $20

Total cost for picture frames = Number of seniors × Cost per picture frame
\[ \text{Total cost for picture frames} = 44 \times 20 = \$880 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for etching the logo
- Number of seniors = 44
- Additional cost per frame (etching) = 20%

Cost per etched frame = Original cost + (Original cost * 20%)

Cost per etched frame = $20 + ($20 * 0.2)
\[ \text{Cost per etched frame} = \$20 + \$4 = \$24 \]

Number of etched frames needed = Number of seniors / 4
\[ \text{Number of etched frames needed} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Total cost for etching = Number of etched frames × Cost per etched frame
\[ \text{Total cost for etching} = 11 \times 24 = \$264 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for pins
- Number of seniors = 44
- Cost per pin = $5

Total cost for pins = Number of seniors × Cost per pin
\[ \text{Total cost for pins} = 44 \times 5 = \$220 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost for cords
- Number of seniors = 44
- Cost per cord = $12

Total cost for cords = Number of seniors × Cost per cord
\[ \text{Total cost for cords} = 44 \times 12 = \$528 \]

### Final Calculation
Now, add all these amounts together to get the total cost.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for picture frames} + \text{Total cost for etching} + \text{Total cost for pins} + \text{Total cost for cords} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$880 + \$264 + \$220 + \$528 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$1752 \]

Therefore, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $\boxed{\$1752}$.<|im_end|>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.

The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the savings from DIY:**
   - The original price of the hand-painted wallpaper at the market is $400.
   - The DIY option saves 20% on the materials cost.

2. **Calculate the amount saved on materials:**
   - To find out how much money the DIY option saves, we need to calculate 20% of $400.
   \[
   \text{Amount saved} = 400 \times \frac{20}{100} = 400 \times 0.2 = \$80
   \]

3. **Subtract the saved amount from the original price:**
   - Subtract the saved amount from the original price to get the total cost for the DIY option.
   \[
   \text{Total cost (DIY)} = 400 - 80 = \$320

2. **Saturday Sales:**
   - They sold double the number from Friday.
     \[
     \text{Saturday Sales} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours Hallie practiced dance in a week, we need to break down her practice schedule day-by-day and then sum up all the practice sessions.

**Step 1: Calculate Tuesday's Practice**
- Hallie practices for 2 hours on Tuesdays.
- So, the total practice time for Tuesday = 2 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate Thursday's Practice**
- Hallie practices for 2 hours on Thursdays.
- So, the total practice time for Thursday = 2 hours.

**Step 3: Calculate Saturday's Practice**
- On Saturdays, Hallie practices twice as long as Tuesday’s session.
- Since Tuesday's session was 2 hours long, Saturday's session would be \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours long.

**Step 4: Sum Up All Sessions in a Week**
- Total practice time for the week = (Tuesday) + (Thursday) + (Saturday)
- Total practice time = 2 hours (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 4 hours (Saturday)

Let's do the addition:

\[
2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}

1. **Calculate the value of the faulty equipment:**
   - The total purchase amount was $400,000.
   - The percentage of faulty equipment is 40%.

To determine how much milk Mary collects daily, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sheep that get 1 kg of milk:**
   - There are 30 sheep in total.
   - Half of them (i.e., 15) will get 1 kg of milk.

2. **Calculate the amount of milk collected from these 15 sheep:**
   - Each sheep gives 1 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk per day.

3. **Determine the number of sheep that get 2 kg of milk:**
   - The remaining sheep (i.e., 15) will get 2 kg of milk.

4. **Calculate the amount of milk collected from these 15 sheep:**
   - Each sheep gives 2 kg of milk.
   - Therefore, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk per day.

5. **Sum up the total milk collected from both groups of sheep:**
   - From the first group (15 sheep): 15 kg/day.
   - From the second group (15 sheep): 30 kg/day.
   - Total milk collected per day = 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg/day.

                    question:
                    Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the , number of apples ? she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 : from selling the apples picked ! on : Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total revenue from selling apples on Monday.
- Lucy sells apples for $4 each.
- Let \( x \) be the number of apples she sold on Monday.

Given that her total revenue was $56, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 56 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{56}{4} \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, Lucy sold **14** apples on Monday.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples picked on Tuesday.
- Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

### Step 3: Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.
- Number of apples picked on Wednesday:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

### Step 4: Find the total number of apples picked in the three days.
- Total apples picked:
\[ 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) \]
\[ = 14 + 12 + 24 \]
\[ = 50 \]

Therefore, Lucy picked a total of **50 apples** over the three days.<|im_end|>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.

                    Lindsay : is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There ? are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, ; how many socks has Lindsay missed?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many socks Lindsay has washed and then subtract that number from the total number of socks that need washing.

Step 1: Determine the total number of socks Lindsay has already washed.
- Lindsay has washed 10 pairs of socks. Since one pair consists of 2 socks, she has washed \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks in pairs.
- Additionally, she has washed 15 loose socks.
So, the total number of socks she has washed so far is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

Step 2: Subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks that need washing.
- The total number of socks that need washing is 50.
- Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(50 - 35 = 15\).

Final Answer:
The final answer is: \(\boxed{15}\)<|im_end|>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.
This means she has washed a total of 20 paired socks + 15 loose socks = <<20+15=35>>35 socks.
She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

2. **Subtract the number of cookies eaten by Rachel's brother from the total:**
   - Rachel's brother eats 44 cookies.

   So, the remaining number of cookies is:
   \[
   65 - 44 = 21

                    question:
                    Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at an interest rate ; of 10%. She has ! to pay an equal amount ? every month. How much does she have to pay per month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Karan needs to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total interest on the loan**
Given that the principal (P) is $3,650 and the monthly interest rate (r) is 10% or 0.10, we can calculate the total interest using the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = P \times r \times t \]

Here, \( t \) represents time in years. Since the borrowing period is five months, we convert this into years:

\[ t = \frac{5}{12} \] years.

Now, plug in the values:

\[ \text{Interest} = \$3,650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \]

Calculate the interest:

\[ \text{Interest} = \$3,650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = \$189.07 \]

So, the total interest over the five-month period is approximately $189.07.

**Step 2: Determine the total amount to be paid back including the interest**

Add the total interest to the principal:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$3,650 + \$189.07 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$3,839.07 \]

**Step 3: Divide the total amount by the number of payments (months)**

Since Karan pays an equal amount every month, divide the total amount by the number of months (5):

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\$3,839.07}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \$767.81 \]

Therefore, Karan has to pay approximately **$767.81** per month.<|im_end|>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

To determine how much farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Cho's Distance:**
   - Cho's speed = 14 km/h
   - Time spent hiking = 8 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
     \[
     \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 14 \text{ km/h} \times 8 \text{ h}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 112 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Calculate Chloe's Distance:**
   - Chloe's speed = 9 km/h
   - Time spent hiking = 5 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
     \[
     \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 9 \text{ km/h} \times 5 \text{ h}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 45 \text{ km}
     \]

3. **Compare the distances:**
   - Distance hiked by Cho = 112 km
   - Distance hiked by Chloe = 45 km
   - Difference in distance = Distance hiked by Cho - Distance hiked by Chloe
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 112 \text{ km} - 45 \text{ km}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 67 \text{ km}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu:**
   - We know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
   - He also delivers \( \frac{1}{3} \) as many messages to Mr. Yu.

2. **Calculate the number of messages for Mr. Yu:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of messages sent to Mr. Yu.
   - According to the given information, \( x = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 \).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

4. **Add the two amounts together to find the total number of messages delivered:**
   - Messages to Ms. Thompson: 66
   - Messages to Mr. Yu: 22

5. **Sum these values:**
   \[
   66 + 22 = 88
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the cost if both pay separately:**

   - Each ride costs 2 tickets.
   - There are 9 rides in total.

   Therefore, the number of rides = \(9 \times 2 = 18\) tickets.

   The cost per ticket is $2, so the total cost without any discounts or bracelets would be:
   
   \[
   18 \text{ tickets} \times \$2/\text{ticket} = \$36
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost if both use ride bracelets:**

   - Each ride bracelet allows 9 rides.
   - They choose to ride all 9 rides.

   So, they will need one ride bracelet (since they have enough rides).

   The cost of one ride bracelet is $30.

3. **Compare the two scenarios:**

   - Without using ride bracelets, the total cost is $36.
   - Using ride bracelets, the total cost remains $30 since they already bought the ride bracelet.

4. **Determine the savings:**

   To find out how much money David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of paying separately, we subtract the cost of the ride bracelet from the cost without the bracelet.

   Savings = Cost without ride bracelets - Cost with ride bracelet
   
   \[
   \$36 - \$30 = \$6

Therefore, David saves \(\boxed{\$6}\) by buying the ride bracelet instead of paying separately for all the rides.<|im_end|>","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.

                    question:
                    Monica is wrapping , Christmas gifts. She has ! 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends ; and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers. She has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift with it. How many inches of ribbon can she use for : each gift ; bow?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon Monica can use per gift and how much ribbon can be used in total to make bows.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of gifts**
Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. The total number of gifts is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total gifts} = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of ribbon per gift**
Since Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and she wants to make a bow for each gift, the ribbon per gift is:

\[ \text{Ribbon per gift} = \frac{\text{Total ribbon}}{\text{Number of gifts}} = \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

So, Monica can use **12 inches of ribbon per gift**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for bows**
If Monica uses 12 inches of ribbon for each bow, then the total amount of ribbon used for all the bows (which is equivalent to the total ribbon) is:

\[ \text{Total ribbon for bows} = 12 \times \text{Number of bows} \]

However, since the problem states that she has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift, she will use up all 144 inches of ribbon if she makes one bow per gift. So, let's assume she wants to make one bow per gift. Therefore, the total amount of ribbon used for bows is equal to the total ribbon available.

Therefore, the total amount of ribbon used for bows is **144 inches**.

**Final Answer:**
- Each gift requires **12 inches of ribbon**.
- For bows, the total amount of ribbon used is **144 inches**.<|im_end|>","Monica is has 6 gifts for family + 4 gifts for friends + 2 gifts for teachers = <<6+4+2=12>>12 gifts to wrap.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The ratio of popsicles Betty has to the total number of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:11.
- The total number of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 165.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of one part in the ratio
Since the ratio is 5:11 (Betty's ratio), we can say that for every 5 parts Betty has, Sam has 6 parts.

### Step 3: Determine the number of parts for each person
- Betty's share = 5 parts
- Sam's share = 6 parts

### Step 4: Find the total number of popsicles each person has
- Betty's total = \( \frac{5}{11} \times 165 \)
- Sam's total = \( \frac{6}{11} \times 165 \)

Let's calculate these values:

- Betty's total:
\[ \text{Betty's total} = \frac{5}{11} \times 165 = 80 \]

- Sam's total:
\[ \text{Sam's total} = \frac{6}{11} \times 165 = 75 \]

### Step 5: Find out how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty
- Difference in number of popsicles:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Sam's total} - \text{Betty's total} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 75 - 80 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = -5 \]

### Conclusion
Sam actually has **5** fewer popsicles than Betty.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Tim saves by switching from his current cable service to the new streaming options, let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost of the cable package
Tim currently has a cable subscription that costs $60 per month.

### Step 2: Determine the discounted price for Hulu and Disney+ after the bundle discount
Hulu and Disney+ normally cost $10 each, so together they would be $20 per month without any discounts.
However, Tim takes advantage of the bundled offer where he saves 20%.

- The savings on the combined cost of Hulu and Disney+ = 20% of $20
  \[
  Savings = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4
  \]

So, the effective price for Hulu and Disney+ as part of the bundle is:
\[
\$20 - \$4 = \$16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total monthly cost of Netflix alone
Netflix costs $10 per month.

### Step 4: Compare the total monthly costs before and after cancellation
- Before cancelling, the total cost is $60 (cable) + $10 (netflix) = $70
- After cancelling, the total cost is $16 (Hulu and Disney+) + $10 (Netflix) = $26

### Step 5: Calculate the amount saved
The difference between the original total cost ($70) and the new total cost ($26) will give us the amount saved:
\[
Amount Saved = \$70 - \$26 = \$44
\]

Therefore, by cancelling his cable subscription, Tim can save **$44** per month in addition to the $4 savings from the bundled deal on Hulu and Disney+.<|im_end|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

<|im_start|>system
To determine what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each task:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half the time spent writing, so \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes (which is equivalent to 1.5 hours)

2. **Sum up all the time spent on each task:**

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time spent writing} + \text{Time spent recording} + \text{Time spent editing}
\]

Substitute the values into the equation:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

3. **Determine the percentage of total work time spent on editing:**

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
\]

4. **Simplify the fraction and calculate the result:**

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing her song.<|im_end|>","First find how long Carol spent writing the song in minutes: 4 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<4*60=240>>240 minutes

Given there are 6 rows and 6 columns, the current number of books can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Current number of books} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Step 2: Double the current number of books.

\[ \text{Double the current number} = 36 \times 2 = 72 \]

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pre-made Valentine's cards Erica has.
Erica's dad brought her two boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards.

- Number of boxes = 2
- Cards per box = 15
- Total cards from dad = \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \)

So, Erica initially has 30 pre-made Valentine's cards.

### Step 2: Add the number of cards Erica made herself.
Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Erica has after receiving more cards.
Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates, 5 cards to her family, and received 17 cards from family and friends.

- Cards passed out = 24 (classmates) + 5 (family) = 29
- Cards received = 17

### Step 4: Subtract the number of cards she gave away from the total.
Total cards before giving any away = 30 (pre-made) + 20 (made herself)
Cards given away = 29 (to classmates and family)

- Cards remaining = 30 + 20 - 29 = 21

### Step 5: Add the cards received back into the count.
Finally, we add the 17 cards received back into the count of cards Erica has.

- Final count = 21 (remaining after giving some away) + 17 (received back)
= **48** Valentine's Day cards**

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 48.<|im_end|>","Her dad gave her 2 boxes of 15 cards so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of slices given to Bill**

Jenny gives Bill \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the total slices.

Total slices = 12

Slices given to Bill = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \)

\[
\text{Slices for Bill} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of slices given to Mark**

Jenny gives Mark \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total slices.

Slices given to Mark = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \)

\[
\text{Slices for Mark} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices given away**

Sum the slices given to Bill and Mark.

\[
\text{Total slices given away} = Slices for Bill + Slices for Mark
\]
\[
= 4 \text{ slices (Bill)} + 3 \text{ slices (Mark)}
\]
\[
= 7 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the slices given away from the original amount**

Subtract the total slices given away from the initial number of slices.

Initial slices = 12

Remaining slices after giving some away = Initial slices - Total slices given away

\[
\text{Remaining slices} = 12 - 7
\]
\[
= 5 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 5: Account for Jenny eating 2 slices**

Subtract the slices Jenny eats from the remaining slices.

Final number of slices left = Remaining slices - Slices eaten by Jenny

\[
\text{Final number of slices left} = 5 \text{ slices} - 2 \text{ slices (eaten by Jenny)}

To determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bike costing $300, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Mark will earn:**
   - Mark starts with $50.
   - He earns $10 per day.

2. **Determine the number of days required to reach or exceed the cost of the bike:**

   The bike costs $300. Let \( d \) represent the number of days needed.

   We can set up an equation to find \( d \):

   \[
   50 + 10d = 300
   \]

   Here, \( 50 \) represents Mark's initial balance, and \( 10d \) represents the total earnings over \( d \) days.

3. **Solve for \( d \):**

   First, subtract $50 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   10d = 300 - 50
   \]
   \[
   10d = 250
   \]

   Next, divide both sides by 10:

   \[
   d = \frac{250}{10}

   \[
   d = 25

                    question:
                    Nancy is cleaning out her old woodshed. She saw 90 spiders, 1/3rd as many millipedes as , spiders, and a : number of stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus ; 12. How many bugs did she count total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of insect that Nancy counted. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of millipedes
Nancy saw 90 spiders. According to the problem, she sees \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.
\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stink bugs
The number of stink bugs is given as twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

### Step 3: Sum up all insects
Now, let's add up all the insects she found.
- Spiders: 90
- Millipedes: 30
- Stink bugs: 48

Total number of insects:
\[
90 + 30 + 48 = 168
\]

Therefore, Nancy counted a total of **168** bugs.<|im_end|>","First find the number of millipedes: 90 spiders / 3 spiders/millipede = <<90/3=30>>30 millipedes
Then multiply the number of millipedes by 2: 30 bugs * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bugs
Then subtract 12 to find the number of stink bugs: 60 bugs - 12 bugs = <<60-12=48>>48 bugs
Then add the number of each kind of bug to find the total: 48 bugs + 30 bugs + 90 bugs = <<48+30+90=168>>168 bugs

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Alice based on the given information about her relationship to Beth and Erica.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the age of Erica:**
   - Erica's age is given as 30 years.

2. **Determine the age of Beth:**
   - The problem states that Beth is 5 years younger than Erica.
     \[
     \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} - 5
     \]
     Substituting Erica’s age:
     \[
     \text{Beth's age} = 30 - 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine the age of Alice:**
   - The problem states that Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
     \[
     \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7
     \]
     Substituting Beth’s age:
     \[
     \text{Alice's age} = 25 + 7 = 32
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:**
   - Subtract Erica's age from Alice's age.
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age}
     \]
     Substituting their ages:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 32 - 30 = 2

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much the builder earns in a year, we need to break down the information given and perform calculations step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of workdays per month:**
   - The builder works 6 days per week.
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month (since the question specifies working 4 weeks/month).
   
   \[
   \text{Total workdays per month} = 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month}
   \]
   
2. **Calculate the total number of workdays in a year:**
   - Assuming there are 12 months in a year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total workdays per year} = \text{Total workdays per month} \times 12
   \]

3. **Determine the earnings per workday:**
   - The builder earns $50 per day.
   
4. **Calculate the total earnings in a year:**
   - Multiply the total number of workdays in a year by the daily wage.
   
Let's do these calculations:

1. Total workdays per month:
   \[
   6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month}
   \]

2. Total workdays per year:
   \[
   24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year}
   \]

3. Daily earnings:
   \[
   \$50 \text{ per day}
   \]

4. Yearly earnings:
   \[
   288 \text{ days/year} \times \$50 \text{ per day} = \$14,400
   \]

Therefore, the builder earns $\boxed{14400}$ dollars in a year.<|im_end|>","The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of flour and milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many additional bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour needed
- Normal recipe requires 3 cups of flour.
- For a quadruple batch, Mark will need \(4 \times 3 = 12\) cups of flour.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

So, Mark has to buy **6** bags of flour.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of milk needed
- Normal recipe requires 1 cup of milk.
- For a quadruple batch, Mark will need \(4 \times 1 = 4\) cups of milk.

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:

\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, Mark has to buy **2** bottles of milk.

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the number of bags and bottles needed
Mark needs **6** bags of flour but only **2** bottles of milk.

Therefore, the number of additional bags of flour that Mark needs compared to bottles of milk is:

\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Thus, Mark has to buy **4** more bags of flour than bottles of milk.<|im_end|>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.

To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

                    question:
                    , Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 ? hours a day. This means that each hour the AC uses 900 watts of energy. If he reduces ; the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours . a day, how many kilowatts of electric ; energy will he save in 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Calculate the total electricity consumption per day when using the air conditioner.
2. Determine the new daily usage after reducing the time spent on the air conditioner.
3. Calculate the total savings over 30 days.

Let's go through these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total electricity consumption per day

- The power rating of the air conditioner is 900 watts (W).
- Mel uses it for 8 hours per day.

First, convert the wattage to kilowatts (kW):
\[ 900 \text{ W} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \]

Next, calculate the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day:
\[ \text{Energy per day} = \text{Power rating} \times \text{Time used} \]
\[ \text{Energy per day} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Energy per day} = 7.2 \text{ kWh} \]

So, Mel uses \( 7.2 \text{ kWh} \) of electricity per day.

### Step 2: Determine the new daily usage after reducing the time spent on the air conditioner

- If Mel reduces his use by 5 hours per day, then he now only uses the air conditioner for:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} - 5 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

Calculate the new daily electricity consumption:
\[ \text{New Energy per day} = \text{Power rating} \times \text{New Time used} \]
\[ \text{New Energy per day} = 0.9 \text{ kW} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} \]
\[ \text{New Energy per day} = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total savings over 30 days

Now, find out how much electricity Mel saves in 30 days:
\[ \text{Savings per day} = \text{Original Daily Consumption} - \text{New Daily Consumption} \]
\[ \text{Savings per day} = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day} - 2.7 \text{ kWh/day} \]
\[ \text{Savings per day} = 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \]

Finally, calculate the total savings over 30 days:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = \text{Savings per day} \times \text{Number of Days} \]
\[ \text{Total Savings} = 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Total Savings} = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

Therefore, Mel will save **135 kWh** of electricity in 30 days if he reduces his use from 8 hours to 3 hours per day.<|im_end|>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

<|im_start|>user
To find out how many stripes the zebras have on average, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes for all zebras.**

- Jane counted two zebras with 17 stripes each.
\[ \text{Zebras A} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

- The second zebra has 36 stripes.

- The third zebra has half as many stripes as the first zebra with 36 stripes.

\[
\text{Zebras B} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]
  
**Step 2: Add up the total number of stripes from all zebras.**

\[ \text{Total stripes} = 34 + 36 + 18 \]

Let's perform the addition:

\[ 34 + 36 = 70 \]
\[ 70 + 18 = 88 \]

So, there are **88 stripes in total** across all zebras.

**Step 3: Find the average number of stripes per zebra.**

To find the average, divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras.

\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} \]

Given there are three zebras:

\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = \frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33 \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is approximately **29.33**.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Tyson would spend on making enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of muffaletta sandwiches needed:**
   - Each sandwich serves 4 people.
   - Total people = 20.
   - Number of sandwiches = \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).

2. **Determine the amount of meat required:**
   - Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat.
   - Total meat required = \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat:**
   - Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
   - Cost of meat = \( 5 \times 7 = \$35.00 \).

4. **Determine the amount of cheese required:**
   - We do not have information about the cheese requirements or pricing, so we cannot calculate this step.

Since the problem does not provide information on the amount of cheese needed or its cost, we can only conclude that Tyson will spend $35.00 on the meat for the muffaletta sandwiches.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are twice as many corns as cannolis.
   - Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Calculate the initial amount of corns:**
   Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, we can calculate the number of corns as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times (\text{Number of cannolis}) = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Adjust for additional cannolis bought at the store:**
   Allan buys 60 more cannolis. So, the new number of cannolis is:
   \[
   \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

4. **Adjust for fewer corns bought than cannolis:**
   Allan also buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he just purchased. Therefore, the number of corns bought is:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns bought} = (100 - 40) = 60
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cannolis and corns after adjustments:**
   Now that we have both the current number of cannolis and corns, we add them together to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total cannolis and corns} = 100 (\text{cannolis}) + 60 (\text{corns}) = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is {The final answer is}: 160.<|im_end|>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of steps Elliott has already taken:**
   - Elliott started with 5,000 steps.
   - He walked halfway (half of 10,000) back home, which is 5,000 steps.
   - After walking back home, he added an extra 1,000 steps to go for a short walk with his friend.
   - Therefore, the total number of steps he has already taken is \(5,000 + 5,000 + 1,000 = 11,000\) steps.

2. **Determine how many steps Elliott needs to reach 10,000 steps in total:**
   - If he currently has 11,000 steps and wants to end up at 10,000 steps, he must have taken \(10,000 - 11,000 = -1,000\) steps. This indicates he has gone over his goal by 1,000 steps.

3. **Adjust the calculation based on the given information about the remaining steps:**
   - After completing his jog, he still needed to take 8,000 more steps to reach 10,000 steps (since he was 1,000 steps behind initially).
   - We know he completed his jog and then walked some more before reaching this point.

4. **Find out how many steps he took during his jog:**
   - Let \(x\) be the number of steps he took during his jog.
   - After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.
   - So, he completed his jog plus walked an additional \(y\) steps where \(x + y = 2,000\).

5. **Use the total steps equation:**
   - The total steps should sum up to 10,000 steps if he reaches it exactly. 
   - Since he was 1,000 steps ahead initially and now has 2,000 steps less than his goal, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + (x + y) = 10,000
     \]
   - Substitute \(y = 2,000 - x\) into the equation:
     \[
     x + (x + (2,000 - x)) = 10,000
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     x + 2,000 = 10,000
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 8,000<|im_end|>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                    question:
                    Toby is reading a book that : is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate ? of 300 ; words per minute.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many minutes early Toby will be when he finishes his book, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages in the book**

Given:
- The book is 45 pages long.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of words in the book**

Given:
- Each page contains an average of 200 words.

\[
\text{Total words} = \text{Number of pages} \times \text{Words per page}
\]
\[
\text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Toby to read the entire book**

Given:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Reading rate}}
\]
\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 4: Determine how much time is left after getting to the airport**

Given:
- It takes 10 minutes to reach the airport.

\[
\text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time to reach airport}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining time} = 30 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Toby will finish reading the book in **20 minutes**.

Since Toby needs 60 minutes to reach the airport, he will finish reading before he leaves.

**Step 5: Calculate how many minutes early Toby will be**

Given:
- It takes 20 minutes to read the book.
- He has 60 minutes to reach the airport.

\[
\text{Minutes early} = \text{Time to reach airport} - \text{Time to read book}
\]
\[
\text{Minutes early} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Toby will be **40 minutes** early.

Thus, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Carolyn works ! for a delivery service company that hires ; on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the ? employees' contracts ; expired. Calculate the total amount ; of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to its employees over May and June, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of employees hired in May.
Carolyn's company hired 40 employees in May.

### Step 2: Determine how many employees were still working after half of their contracts expired in June.
Since one-fourth of the employees' contracts expired in June, this means three-fourths of the employees remained active.
- Number of remaining employees = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 40 \)

Let's do the calculation:
\[ \text{Number of remaining employees} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from May.
Each employee worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour during May.
- Total earnings from May = (Number of employees) × (Hours per week) × (Hourly rate)
\[ \text{Total earnings from May} = 40 \times 15 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings from May} = 60000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings from June.
Again, each employee worked for 40 hours at $15 per hour during June.
- Total earnings from June = (Number of remaining employees) × (Hours per week) × (Hourly rate)
\[ \text{Total earnings from June} = 30 \times 15 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings from June} = 18000 \]

### Step 5: Sum up the total earnings for both months.
- Total earnings = Earnings from May + Earnings from June
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 60000 + 18000 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 78000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $\boxed{78000}$.<|im_end|>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000
In the two months, the company paid a total of $72000+$96000 = $<<72000+96000=168000>>168000

                    question:
                    Sally went to the seashore for vacation.  Her parents gave ; her ? $10 to buy whatever she wanted.  At the trinket shop, taffy was on . sale for ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""  She scooped up 2 pounds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Sally spent and then subtract it from the total amount of money she received.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the taffy
- The sale offers ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off.""
- Since Sally bought 2 pounds, she gets both 1 pound at full price and half off.
- Half off means she pays only 50% of the full price (since 100% - 50% = 50%).

Cost calculation:
\[ \text{Full price per pound} = \$3 \]
\[ \text{Half off price per pound} = \$3 \times 0.5 = \$1.5 \]

Total cost for 2 pounds:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \times \$1.5 = \$3 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the seashells
- The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the magnets
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets.
\[ \text{Total cost for magnets} = 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1 \]

### Step 4: Summarize all costs
- Taffy: $3
- Seashell bag: $1.50
- Magnets: $1

Total spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$3 + \$1.50 + \$1 = \$5.50 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the total spent from the initial amount given
Sally initially had $10.

Final amount left:
\[ \text{Money left} = \$10 - \$5.50 = \$4.50 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: $\boxed{\$4.50}$<|im_end|>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tim spent in total, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the second pack of fireworks.
- The first pack costs $400.
- The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack.

\[
\text{Cost of second pack} = 2 \times \$400 = \$800
\]

### Step 2: Add the cost of both packs together before applying the discount.
\[
\text{Total cost of two packs} = \$400 + \$800 = \$1200
\]

### Step 3: Apply the 20% discount to the total cost of the two packs.
- A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price.

\[
\text{Discount amount} = \$1200 \times 0.20 = \$240
\]
  
\[
\text{Final price after discount} = \$1200 - \$240 = \$960
\]

### Step 4: Add the cost of the finale fireworks to the discounted price of the two packs.
\[
\text{Total cost including finale fireworks} = \$960 + \$150 = \$1110
\]

### Conclusion:
Tim spent a total of **$1110** on fireworks.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$1110}

2. **Determine how many cookies are in one dozen:**
   - One dozen equals 12 cookies.

3. **Convert the total number of cookies needed into dozens:**

\[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that will explode.
2. Calculate the number of candles that have a defect which causes them to smell like wet dog.
3. Find out how many candles meet both criteria.

### Step 1: Number of Candles that Will Explode

Given:
- Total candles made = 50,000
- Percentage of candles that will explode = 5%

Calculation:
\[ \text{Number of exploding candles} = 5\% \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.05 \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of exploding candles} = 2,500 \]

### Step 2: Number of Candles with Defects

Given:
- Percentage of candles with defects = 5%
- Percentage of defective candles that make them smell like wet dog = 5%

We can calculate the percentage of total candles that both explode and smell like wet dog using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

\[ \text{Percentage of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = (5\% + 5\%) - 10\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = 10\% \]

Now, let's apply this to our scenario:

\[ \text{Number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = 10\% \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = 0.1 \times 50,000 \]
\[ \text{Number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog} = 5,000 \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5,000} \]<|im_end|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount per blouse:**
   - The original price of each blouse is $20.
   - The store offers a 30% discount on all items.

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.3 = 6
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price:**

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 20 - 6 = 14

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Blouses} \times \text{Discounted Price per Blouse}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the information provided:

1. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
2. Her sister gathers half that amount (15) from the shortest trees.
3. The remaining amount (which we'll call ""x"") Joanne gathers from the average trees.

From point 1, we know Joanne has gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees.

From point 2, we know her sister has gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.

Since Joanne and her sister together have gathered a total of 500 apples, we can set up an equation based on these amounts:

\[ \text{Total apples} = \text{Apples from tallest trees} + \text{Apples from shortest trees} + \text{Apples from average trees} \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 500 = 30 + 15 + x \]

Simplifying the right side gives us:

\[ 500 = 45 + x \]

Now, solving for \(x\):

\[ x = 500 - 45 \]

                    question:
                    A herd consists of camels and . dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. How many dromedaries are there if camels , have two humps each and , dromedaries have one hump each?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of dromedaries in the herd given that the total number of heads and bumps provides us with a system of equations.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of camels,
- \( d \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Each camel has 1 head (since it only has one hump).
2. Each dromedary also has 1 head.
3. Each camel has 2 humps.
4. Each dromedary has 1 hump.
5. The total number of heads is 180.
6. The total number of bumps is 304.

First, let's write down the equations based on these facts:

1. The total number of heads equation: 
\[ c + d = 180 \]

2. The total number of bumps equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

To eliminate \(d\) from these equations, subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
\]
\[
2c + d - c - d = 124
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now substitute \(c = 124\) back into the first equation to find \(d\):
\[
124 + d = 180
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \(\boxed{56}\).<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                    Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe. In the first ! 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day, and over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the : first four : days.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down Tom's journey into segments and calculate the total distance for each segment.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled during the first four days.
Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for 4 days initially.

\[
200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the distance traveled during the last two days.
Over the next two days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he covered in the first four days.

\[
30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining distance after the last two days.
Since there were no trips on the last two days:

\[
800 \text{ km} - 240 \text{ km} = 560 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance for the entire trip.
Now we add up all the distances from both segments to get the total distance:

\[
800 \text{ km (first four days)} + 240 \text{ km (last two days)} + 300 \text{ km (second week)} = 1340 \text{ km}
\]

Therefore, the total number of kilometers Tom made during his two-week-long trip is:

**The final answer is:** 1340 km.<|im_end|>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.
For the next two days, he made only 30/100 * 800 = <<30/100*800=240>>240 kilometers.
During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps:

1. **Determine the size of Zack's locker:**
   - We know that Peter’s locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack’s locker.
   - Let \( Z \) represent the volume of Zack’s locker.
   - Given Peter’s locker volume = 5 cubic inches.

2. **Express Zack’s locker volume in terms of Peter’s locker volume:**
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker volume}
   \]
   \[
   5 = \frac{1}{4} \times Z
   \]

3. **Solve for Zack’s locker volume (Z):**
   \[
   Z = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the size of Timothy’s locker:**
   - We know that Zack’s locker is half as big as Timothy’s locker.
   - Let \( T \) represent the volume of Timothy’s locker.
   - Given Zack’s locker volume = 20 cubic inches.

5. **Express Zack’s locker volume in terms of Timothy’s locker volume:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the elevation difference between Stanley and Oliver.
2. Calculate how much Oliver needs to climb to match that difference.

Let's start with the first part: determining the elevation difference between Stanley and Oliver.

Step 1: Calculate the elevation difference
Stanley is at 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

This means Oliver needs to climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's elevation.

Now let's move to the second part: calculating how much Oliver needs to climb to reach Stanley's elevation.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Oliver needs to climb
Since the elevation difference is 7,000 feet, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's elevation.

To determine how much capital Mr. Josue has after soliciting money from both banks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount given by the first bank:**
   - The first bank gave Mr. Josue $4000.

2. **Determine the amount given by the second bank:**
   - The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank.
   - Calculation for the second bank: \( 2 \times \$4000 = \$8000 \).

3. **Calculate the total amount received from both banks:**
   - Add the amounts from both banks:
     \[
     \$4000 + \$8000 = \$12000
     \]

4. **Add this total to the initial capital Mr. Josue already had:**
   - He initially had $5000 in capital.
   - Adding the received funds to the initial capital:

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Initial number of cats**: There were initially 50 cats.
2. **Boats carrying away cats**:
   - Four boats came, and each boat carried away 5 cats.
   - Total number of cats carried away: \(4 \times 5 = 20\).
   - Number of cats remaining after some were taken away: \(50 - 20 = 30\).

3. **Cats running away afterwards**:
   - After that, three-fifths (3/5) of the remaining cats ran away.
   - Number of cats that ran away: \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\).
   - Number of cats left on the rock: \(30 - 18 = 12\).

4. **Mouse sighting**:
   - The problem mentions ""a mouse had been seen,"" but it doesn't specify what happened next regarding the cats or any other creatures.

Given these steps, let's summarize our findings:

- Initially, there were 50 cats.
- Some cats were carried away by four boats, leaving 30 cats.
- Then, one-third of the remaining cats ran away, leaving 12 cats on the rock.

Since the problem only asks about the number of cats left on the rock after these events, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the costs over time according to the given information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Initial Phase (First 6 Months):
- The initial rate for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for these 6 months: \(6 \times \$8 = \$48\).

#### Transition Phase (Next 2 Months at Normal Rate):
- After 6 months, the normal rate increases to $12 per month.
- Since there are 2 more months after the transition phase, we need to calculate the cost for these 2 months.
- Cost for these 2 months: \(2 \times \$12 = \$24\).

#### Final Phase (Remaining Time at Increased Rate):
- After another 2 months, the rate again increases to $14 per month.
- This means that out of the remaining time (which would be 30 months - 8 months = 22 months), he pays $14 per month.
- Total cost for these 22 months: \(22 \times \$14 = \$308\).

### Calculation Summary:
- **Total cost for the first 6 months:** \$48.
- **Cost for the next 2 months at normal rate:** \$24.
- **Cost for the last 22 months at increased rate:** \$308.

### Summing Up All Costs:
- Total cost for the full year (8 months + 22 months) at the increased rate: 
\[ \$48 + \$24 + \$308 = \$380 \]

Therefore, the total amount Bill has to pay for two years of service is **\$380**.<|im_end|>","There are 12 months in a year, so there are 2 years * 12 months per year = 24 months in 2 years.
He has 6 months at the special rate, followed by 8 months of the normal rate, so out of 24 months he pays the increased rate for 24 months - 6 months - 8 months = <<24-6-8=10>>10 months.
He pays the special rate of $8 a month for 6 months, or 6 months * $8 per month = $<<6*8=48>>48.
He pays the normal rate of $12 a month for 8 months, or 8 months * $12 per month = $<<8*12=96>>96.
He pays the new raised rate of $14 a month for 10 months, or 10 months * $14 per month = $<<10*14=140>>140.
Over two years, he pays a total of $48 + $96 + $140 = $<<48+96+140=284>>284.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the original price of the jogger jeans.
- Let \( J \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
- According to the information given, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

So, we can write the equation:
\[ J = T - 6 \]
where \( T \) is the original price of the tattered jeans.

We know that the tattered jeans cost $28:
\[ T = 28 \]

Substitute \( T \) into the equation:
\[ J = 28 - 6 \]
\[ J = 22 \]

So, the original price of the jogger jeans was $22.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount Cole saved on each type of jeans.
- Savings on tattered jeans: $6 (as given).
- Savings on jogger jeans: Total savings minus savings on tattered jeans.

Since Cole saved a total of $6 in savings from both types of jeans:
\[ Total Savings = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

### Step 3: Find out how much Cole saved on the jogger jeans.
- Cole saved $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

So, let’s calculate his savings on the jogger jeans:
\[ Savings_{jogger} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \]
\[ Savings_{jogger} = 4 \]

### Step 4: Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost compared to the tattered jeans.
- Original price of jogger jeans: $22
- Original price of tattered jeans: $28

Difference in cost:
\[ Difference = 28 - 22 \]
\[ Difference = 6 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 more than the tattered jeans.

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is: } 6}
\]<|im_end|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.

Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

- There are 4 buses, each capable of holding 60 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the minibusses.
- There are 6 minibusses, each capable of holding 30 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of the minivans.
- There are 10 minivans, each capable of holding 15 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

### Step 4: Sum up the capacities from all types of vehicles.
\[ \text{Total capacity} = \text{Capacity of buses} + \text{Capacity of minibusses} + \text{Capacity of minivans} \]
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \]

                    question:
                    Lillian's garden doesn't : have any ; bird feeders in it so she ? wants to add some. She builds 3 and buys 3 others. Each bird feeder seems to attract 20 birds throughout the , day , until Lillian notices that the birds seem to prefer the feeders she made herself which attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. How many : birds can Lillian expect to see in . her garden each day if the same amount keep : coming to her bird feeders?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and perform calculations accordingly.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of birds attracted to store-bought feeders.
- Lillian adds 3 bird feeders from the store.
- Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds per day.
- Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.

### Step 2: Determine the number of birds attracted to homemade feeders.
- Lillian makes 3 homemade feeders.
- Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than a store-bought one.
- Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each homemade feeder attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day.
- Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the homemade feeders is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders.
- The total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders combined is \(60 + 90 = 150\) birds per day.

### Step 4: Determine how many days' worth of birds Lillian expects to see.
- We know that the birds keep coming for 7 days (since they started on Monday).
- To find out how many days' worth of birds Lillian will expect to see, divide the total number of birds by 7.
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{150}{7} \approx 21.43 \]
Since we can only count whole numbers of days, we round up to the nearest whole number because even a partial day means at least one full day’s worth of birds will be present.

Therefore, Lillian will expect to see approximately 22 days’ worth of birds in her garden each day over the next few weeks.

### Final Answer:
Lillian will expect to see **22 days** worth of birds in her garden each day.<|im_end|>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.
Lillian first notices each bird feeder attracts 20 birds, 6 x 20 = <<6*20=120>>120 birds.
Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

                    Aleksandra went to a restaurant for dinner. She ordered some ? soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4, and the soup 25% more. The cake is only half of : the price of the : bagel. How much did Aleksandra need to pay for , the dinner she . ordered?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the costs:**
   - Bagel: $4
   - Soup (cost is 25% more than the bagel): Let the bagel be represented as B.
     Soup = B + 0.25B = 1.25B
     Since B = $4,
     Soup = 1.25 * $4 = $5
   - Cake: Half the price of the bagel. So, if we denote the cake as C,
     C = 0.5 * B
     Since B = $4,
     C = 0.5 * $4 = $2

2. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of Bagel + Cost of Soup + Cost of Cake
   - Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2
   - Total cost = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $11.<|im_end|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.
So the soup cost is 4 + 1 = $<<4+1=5>>5.
The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it is 4 * 0.5 = $<<4*0.5=2>>2.
Aleksandra needed to pay 4 + 5 + 2 = $<<4+5+2=11>>11 for dinner.

                    question:
                    Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a , ticket to an amusement park, : which costs $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how many cards Kenny started with, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Kenny will spend on the amusement park.
Kenny needs $100 for the amusement park.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Kenny can earn from selling his cards.
Kenny sells each card for $1.5 and keeps 1/3 of them. This means he retains 1/3 of the total number of cards he sells.

Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny starts with.

- Since he keeps 1/3 of the cards, he will keep \( \frac{x}{3} \) cards.
- The remaining 2/3 of the cards will be sold.

The revenue from selling the cards is:
\[ 1.5 \times \left( \frac{2x}{3} \right) = 1.5 \times \frac{2x}{3} = x \]

### Step 3: Set up the equation based on the information given.
We know that after selling his cards, he has enough money left over to cover the cost of the amusement park minus the $50 he already has in spending cash.

So, the amount he earns from selling the cards must equal the remaining money needed after purchasing the tickets:
\[ x = 100 - 50 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

### Step 4: Solve for the total number of cards \( x \).
Since he earned $50 from selling the cards, and each card is worth $1.5, we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \left( \frac{x}{3} \right) = 50 \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{x}{3} = 50 \]
\[ \frac{1.5x}{3} = 50 \]
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 50 \]

Now solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ x = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]<|im_end|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many hotdogs were originally planned:**
   - The caterer was supposed to serve enough hotdogs so that half of the guests could have two hotdogs.
   - There are 36 guests in total.

2. **Calculate the number of hotdogs needed if half the guests (18) had two hotdogs:**
   \[
   \text{Total hotdogs} = 18 \times 2 = 36
   \]

3. **Check if the caterer followed the plan:**
   - Since the caterer actually prepared exactly 36 hotdogs as per his original plan, we can proceed without further concern about the initial planning.

4. **Determine how many hotdogs were given out when 40 guests arrived instead:**
   - If there are 40 guests who want a second hotdog, then they will receive 2 hotdogs each.

5. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs distributed when 40 guests took their share:**
   \[
   \text{Hotdogs given out} = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

6. **Determine how many hotdogs are left after distributing them:**
   - Initially, 36 hotdogs were prepared.
   - After giving out 80 hotdogs, we need to account for any remaining hotdogs from previous servings or future needs.

7. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Since all 40 guests wanted at least one more hotdog, none of them got a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 0.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 0.<|im_end|>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.

1. Determine the number of letters in Indras' name.
2. Calculate how many letters are in her sister's name based on the given condition.
3. Add the number of letters from both names together.

Let's start with the first step:

### Step 1: Number of Letters in Indras' Name
Indras has 6 letters in her name.

### Step 2: Number of Letters in Her Sister's Name
Her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.

First, calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, add 4 to that value:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

### Step 3: Total Number of Letters
Now, add the number of letters from both names together:
\[
6 \text{ (Indras)} + 7 \text{ (sister)} = 13
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discounts.
- Pot and Pans: $120.00
- Mixing Bowls: $20.00
- Utensils (each costing $5.00): 5 × $5.00 = $25.00

Total cost before discount = Pot and Pans + Mixing Bowls + Utensils
= $120.00 + $20.00 + ($5.00 × 5)
= $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00
= $165.00

### Step 2: Apply the 20% discount.
Since there is a 20% discount on the total order, we first calculate what 20% of the total cost is.

Discount amount = Total cost before discount × Discount rate
= $165.00 × 0.20
= $33.00

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the total cost.
Final cost after discount = Total cost before discount - Discount amount
= $165.00 - $33.00
= $132.00

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \boxed{132.00}<|im_end|>","She wants 5 utensils at $5.00 each so they cost 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the amount of gas in one container:**
   - There are 15 gallons of gas.
   - This gas is equally divided among 5 containers.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas in one container = \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) gallons.

2. **Determine how much gas Josey needs:**
   - Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container.
   - Since each container contains 3 gallons, Josey needs \( 3 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \) gallons.

3. **Convert gallons to pints:**
   - We know that there are 8 pints in a gallon.
   - So, \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons can be converted to pints as follows: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \) pints.

Therefore, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on chips.
George spent $5 in total. He bought some number of bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents (or $0.40).

Let \( x \) be the number of bags of chips he bought. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 0.40x = 5 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{5}{0.40} = 12.5
\]

Since \( x \) must be an integer (as you can't buy half a bag), let's consider if there might have been a mistake or misunderstanding. However, since the context suggests buying whole numbers of items, we'll assume the calculation was correct but interpreted as fractional bags. 

### Step 2: Determine how much money George has left after spending on chips.
If George buys 12.5 bags of chips, he spends:

\[ 12.5 \times 0.40 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

This means he used all $5 he initially had to buy chips. Since he only had $5 and spent all of it on chips, he cannot buy any candy bars because he doesn't have enough money left over from his initial purchase.

### Conclusion:
Given that George cannot afford to buy any candy bars without using up his entire budget, he does not buy any candy bars at all.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{0}}
\]<|im_end|>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05

                    Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 lollipops and shared the remaining ? equally with his four friends. How many lollipops . did each of his friends receive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many lollipops were left after Ray kept some:**
   - Ray started with 25 lollipops.
   - He kept 5 lollipops for himself.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops left} = 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Divide the remaining lollipops among Ray's four friends:**
   - There are 4 friends.
   - The remaining lollipops (20) need to be divided equally among them.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

3. **Verify that all lollipops have been distributed correctly:**
   - Each friend receives 5 lollipops.
   - Total number of lollipops distributed: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

Since every lollipop has been accounted for, including those kept by Ray, the final distribution matches the total count.

**Final Answer:** Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.<|im_end|>","Ray shared a total of 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 lollipops.
Therefore, each of his friends received 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 lollipops.

                    question:
                    Rory makes a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have a ! piece. How much does ; the remaining cake weigh?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pieces**: Rory and her mom each get one piece from the cake.
   - Total pieces: \( 1 \text{ (Rory)} + 1 \text{ (mom)} = 2 \) pieces.

2. **Calculate the weight of the remaining cake**:
   - The original cake weighs 20 ounces.
   - Each person gets one piece, so there are 2 pieces left.
   - Therefore, the remaining weight of the cake can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of pieces}} \times \text{Weight per piece}
     \]
   - Since the pieces are equal, let's denote the weight per piece as \( x \).
   - Thus,
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight} = \frac{20}{2} \times x = 10x
     \]

3. **Find out how much each person has**:
   - There are 2 pieces, and they share equally between them.
   - So, each person gets half of their piece.
   - Therefore, each person gets \( \frac{x}{2} \).

4. **Check if the division is correct**:
   - If we assume \( x \) is the same for both pieces, then each person would indeed have \( \frac{x}{2} \), which confirms our calculation.

5. **Finalize the answer**:
   - We know the total weight of the remaining cake is 10 times the weight of one piece.
   - Let’s calculate it explicitly:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight} = 10 \times (\text{weight of one piece})
     \]
   - Since each piece is supposed to weigh the same, the remaining cake will be 10 times that amount.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ ounces}}
\]<|im_end|>","Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges:**
   - Sitti has 6 friends.
   - Juris also has 6 friends.
   - Including themselves, they have \(6 + 6 = 12\) people in total.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges:**
   - Sitti bought 34 oranges.
   - Juris bought 22 oranges.
   - Together, they have \(34 + 22 = 56\) oranges.

3. **Divide the total number of oranges among all the people:**
   - There are 12 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).
   - To find out how many oranges each person gets, divide the total number of oranges by the number of people: \(\frac{56}{12}\).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \(56 \div 12 = 4.6667\)

So, each person will get approximately 4.6667 oranges.

1. **Calculate the total number of servings:**
   - Antoine doubles his original amount.
   - Original amount = 2 pounds
   - Doubled amount = 4 pounds

2. **Determine how many servings he can get from the onions:**
   - Each person gets one serving.
   - Number of servings = 4 pounds / 1 pound/serving = 4 servings

3. **Calculate the cost of the onions:**
   - Cost per pound = $2.00
   - Total cost of onions = 4 pounds × $2.00/pound = $8.00

4. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock:**
   - Cost per box = $2.00
   - Number of boxes needed = 2
   - Total cost of beef stock = 2 boxes × $2.00/box = $4.00

5. **Total cost of ingredients:**
   - Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock
   - Total cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

6. **Calculate the average cost per serving:**
   - Average cost per serving = Total cost ÷ Number of servings
   - Average cost per serving = $12.00 ÷ 4 servings ≈ $3.00 per serving

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the time it takes for Wayne to reach the theater:**
   - It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to reach the theater:**
   - Let \( t \) represent the time it takes for Bernadette to travel to the theater.
   - According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette's apartment to the theater is four times longer than the drive from Wayne's hotel to the theater.
   - Therefore, the time for Bernadette = \( 4t \).

3. **Express the relationship between their arrival times:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Since the time for Bernadette is \( 4t \), we can set up an equation based on this information.
   - If Bernadette leaves \( x \) minutes after Wayne, then \( x + 4t = 4x \) (since she arrives 5 minutes before him).
   - Simplifying this equation gives us \( x + 4t = 4x \).
   - Rearranging terms, we have \( 4t = 4x - x \).
   - Simplify further to find \( x = \frac{4t}{3} \).

4. **Substitute \( t \) back into the equation to find the value of \( t \):**
   - We know that \( t \) represents the time it takes for Wayne to reach the theater, which is given as 4 minutes.
   - Substitute \( t = 4 \) into the equation: 
     \[
     x = \frac{4(4)}{3} = \frac{16}{3}
     \]
   - Calculate the exact value: \( x = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \) minutes.

5. **Convert the difference in arrival times to minutes:**
   - Wayne has 4 minutes to reach the theater.
   - Bernadette needs approximately 5.33 minutes more than Wayne to reach the theater.
   - Subtract these times to find out how early Bernadette should leave:  
     \[
     5.33 - 4 = 1.33 \text{ minutes}
     \]

**Final Answer:** Bernadette should leave 1.33 minutes before Wayne to arrive at the theater first.<|im_end|>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert units from yards to feet**:
   - We know that \(1\) yard = \(3\) feet.
   - Therefore, if the length of the room is \(3\) yards, it converts to \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

2. **Calculate the width of the room using the given area**:
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Here, the area is \(360\) square feet and the length is \(9\) feet.
   - Let \(w\) be the width of the room. Then,
     \[
     360 = 9 \times w
     \]
   - Solving for \(w\),
     \[
     w = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room**:
   - The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found,
     \[
     P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the perimeter of Billie’s room is \(98\) feet. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{98}\)<|im_end|>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads for Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.

First, calculate the total number of packs:
\[ 1 \text{ (red)} + 2 \text{ (clear)} = 3 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
\[ 3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads for Margareth.
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.

Calculate the total number of packs:
\[ 3 \text{ (blue)} + 4 \text{ (red)} = 7 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack contains 20 beads, so:
\[ 7 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 140 \text{ beads} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other.
Elizabeth has \( 60 \) beads, and Margareth has \( 140 \) beads.

Subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, **Margareth** has **80 more beads** than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: The final answer is 80.<|im_end|>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial increase in temperature due to baking.
- Initial temperature when Marcus wakes up = 40°C
- Time spent baking = 3 hours
- Temperature rise per hour while oven is on = 5°C
- Total time the oven is on = 3 hours
- Total temperature rise during baking = (3 hours) × (5°C/hour) = 15°C

### Step 2: Add the temperature rise from baking to the initial temperature.
- Final temperature after baking = Initial temperature + Temperature rise
= 40°C + 15°C = 55°C

### Step 3: Calculate the cooling effect caused by opening the window.
- Time window is open = 30 minutes
- Cooling rate = -2°C/10 minutes
- Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals
- Total cooling due to window opening = (-2°C/10 minutes) × 3 intervals = -6°C

### Step 4: Subtract the cooling effect from the current temperature.
- Final temperature after opening the window = Current temperature - Cooling effect
= 55°C - (-6°C) = 55°C + 6°C = 61°C

### Conclusion
Therefore, the house's final temperature is **61°C**.

{The final answer is} 61°C<|im_end|>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took James to complete each part of the triathlon based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the total time Jon spent in the triathlon:**
   - Swim: 40 minutes
   - Bike ride: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 70 minutes
   - Run: 50 minutes
   \[
   \text{Total time Jon} = 40 + 70 + 50 = 160 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine James's swim time:**
   - James swims 10% faster than Jon.
   - Jon's swim time is 40 minutes.
   - Therefore, James's swim time is \(40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36\) minutes.

3. **Determine James's bike ride time:**
   - The problem states that James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike ride compared to Jon.
   - Jon's bike ride time is 70 minutes.
   - Therefore, James's bike ride time is \(70 + 5 = 75\) minutes.

4. **Determine James's run time:**
   - We know that Jon finished the race 10 minutes ahead of James.
   - Let \(x\) be the time it took James to finish the run.
   - Since Jon took 10 minutes more to finish the race, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + 40 + 70 = 10 + x + 50
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
     \[
     x + 110 = 10 + x + 50
     \]
   - Subtracting \(x\) from both sides:
     \[
     110 = 10 + 50
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     110 = 60
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 110 - 60 = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

James took 50 minutes to complete the run.<|im_end|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes

Movie C has a duration of 1.25 hours.

\[ \text{Convert } 1.25 \text{ hours to minutes} = 1.25 \times 60 \]

\[
1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

### Step 2: Determine the length of Movie B in terms of Movie C.
We know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C.

Since Movie C is 75 minutes long,

\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Determine the length of Movie A in terms of Movie B.
We know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{\text{Length of Movie B}}{4} \]

Substitute the value of Movie B’s length into the equation.

\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the length of Movie A.
\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Movie A is **20** minutes long.<|im_end|>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes
Movie B = 75 + 5 = <<75+5=80>>80 minutes
Movie A = (1/4) * 80 = <<(1/4)*80=20>>20 minutes
Movie A was <<20=20>>20 minutes long.

                    question:
                    Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he ? eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of : hay costs $3. If his horse : runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 . dollar bills, how ? much change does he have after he buys the hay?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse can run in 30 minutes.
- The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).
- Time = 30 minutes.

First, convert the time from minutes to hours since the speed is given in miles per hour:
\[ \text{Time in hours} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the distance the horse can cover in 0.5 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total amount of hay consumed.
- For every mile the horse runs, it consumes \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay.
- Total distance covered = 16 miles.

Now, calculate the total number of bails of hay consumed:
\[ \text{Total bails of hay} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bails/mile} \]
\[ \text{Total bails of hay} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay.
- Each bail of hay costs $3.

Now, compute the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bails} \times \text{Cost per bail} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3/\text{bail} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$24 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the change left after buying the hay.
Michael starts with six $5 bills, so his initial amount of money is:
\[ \text{Initial amount} = 6 \times \$5 \]
\[ \text{Initial amount} = \$30 \]

Subtract the total cost of the hay from his initial amount:
\[ \text{Change} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \text{Change} = \$30 - \$24 \]
\[ \text{Change} = \$6 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$6}
\]<|im_end|>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

The hay will cost $24 because 8 x $3 = <<8*3=24>>24

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs used:**
   - First, calculate the number of eggs from the cases.
     \[
     4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Then, add the loose eggs.
     \[
     48 \text{ (from cases)} + 2 \text{ (loose)} = 50 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of eggs needed per tray:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, and each glass requires 5 eggs.
   - Therefore, each tray will have:
     \[
     5 \text{ glasses/tray} \times 5 \text{ eggs/glass} = 25 \text{ eggs/tray}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of trays needed:**
   - Divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray holds.
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{25 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
     \]

So, Rozanne can put out **2 trays** of eggnog.<|im_end|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

<|im_start|>super
To determine by how many points Joey is winning after the turns, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Joey's total score after scoring.
Joey initially had 214 points. After scoring 26 more points, we add these to his initial score.

\[ \text{Total points for Joey} = 214 + 26 \]

Let's perform this addition:

\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

So, Joey's new total score is **240 points**.

### Step 2: Calculate Marcy's total score after her turn.
Marcy starts with 225 points. She then scores an additional 10 points.

\[ \text{Total points for Marcy} = 225 + 10 \]

Let's perform this addition:

\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

So, Marcy's new total score is **235 points**.

### Step 3: Determine the difference between Joey's and Marcy's scores.
Now, we subtract Marcy's total score from Joey's total score to find out how many points Joey leads.

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Joey's points} - \text{Marcy's points} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 240 - 235 \]

Let's perform this subtraction:

\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Therefore, Joey is currently winning by **5 points**.

### Final Answer:
\[

To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling all sneakers.**

- The salesman bought 48 sneakers.
- He sold 17 sneakers at a flash sale for $20 each.
- The remaining sneakers (48 - 17 = 31) were sold to a department store for $25 each.

Revenue from the flash sale:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 17 \times \$20 = \$340 \]

Revenue from selling to the department store:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 31 \times \$25 = \$775 \]

Total revenue:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115 \]

**Step 2: Subtract the cost of buying the sneakers from the total revenue to find the profit.**

Cost of buying the sneakers:
\[ \text{Cost} = \$576 \]

Profit calculation:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539 \]

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of colors Beatrice has from both types of packets. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of colors from the six packets that have eight pieces:**
   - Each of these six packets contains 8 colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of colors from these six packets is \(6 \times 8\).

2. **Calculate the total number of colors from the four packets that have sixteen pieces:**
   - Each of these four packets contains 16 colors.
   - Therefore, the total number of colors from these four packets is \(4 \times 16\).

3. **Add the two totals together to get the overall total number of colors:**

Let's perform the calculations:

- For the six packets with eight colors each:
  \[
  6 \times 8 = 48
  \]

- For the four packets with sixteen colors each:
  \[
  4 \times 16 = 64

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's break down the given information:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost without buying the Super Ticket
- **Super Ticket Cost**: $20
- **Regular Movie Ticket Cost**: $12
- **Cost of Popcorn + Soda**: $4 (since popcorn = $1 extra soda)

Given that the Super Ticket saved the person $2 in total, we need to find out how much they would have spent on just the movie tickets and other items.

Let \( P \) be the regular price of popcorn.
- The total cost without the Super Ticket would be:
  - Regular Movie Tickets: \( 2 \times \$12 = \$24 \)
  - Other items (Popcorn + Soda): \( 2 \times (\$1 + \$3) = \$5 \)

Total cost without Super Ticket:
\[ \$24 + \$5 = \$29 \]

### Step 2: Determine the amount spent after buying the Super Ticket
Since the Super Ticket costs $20, this effectively means the person bought two movie tickets but paid for only one popcorn and soda combo.

Thus, the amount saved by not buying the Super Ticket is $2.

### Step 3: Calculate the actual savings
We know that the Super Ticket saved them $2 in total. This savings is due to the combination of popcorn and soda, which was included in the Super Ticket purchase.

So, the cost of the popcorn and soda combo should be equal to the savings from not buying the Super Ticket.

Let’s set up an equation where \( S \) represents the combined cost of popcorn and soda:

\[ S = 2P \]
This is because the Super Ticket offers both popcorn and soda combos.

### Step 4: Solve for \( P \)
Given that the Super Ticket saves them $2, and knowing that the combined cost of popcorn and soda equals $2, we substitute back into our equation:

\[ S = \$2 \]
Substituting \( S \) with \( 2P \):
\[ 2P = \$2 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{\$2}{2} \]
\[ P = \$1 \]

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is **\$1**.<|im_end|>","The super ticket costs $20 and for $1 extra I can get a popcorn and a soda, there I'd pay in total $20+$1 = $<<20+1=21>>21

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the original cost per helium balloon.
2. Calculate the new cost per helium balloon after the increase.
3. Find out how many helium balloons were filled initially.
4. Determine the total number of helium balloons that were filled after the price increase.
5. Calculate the total cost for these additional balloons using the new price.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine the original cost per helium balloon
Given that the total cost for 20 helium balloons was $900, we can find the original cost per balloon by dividing the total cost by the number of balloons.

\[
\text{Original Cost per Balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} = \$45
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new cost per helium balloon after the increase
After two days, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20. So, the new cost per balloon would be:

\[
\text{New Cost per Balloon} = \$45 + \$20 = \$65
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many helium balloons were filled initially
We know that initially, 20 balloons were filled at $45 each. Let \( n \) represent the number of balloons filled initially. Therefore,

\[
n \times \$45 = \$900
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{\$900}{\$45} = 20
\]

So, 20 balloons were filled initially.

### Step 4: Determine the total number of helium balloons that were filled after the price increase
Bentley filled 170 balloons after the price increase. Since 20 balloons were already filled initially, the remaining balloons to be filled are:

\[
170 - 20 = 150
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for these additional balloons using the new price
Now, we calculate the total cost for the 150 additional balloons at the new price of $65 each:

\[
\text{Total Cost for Additional Balloons} = 150 \times \$65 = \$9750
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

<|im_start|>wait
To find the car's average speed during the entire trip, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at each speed.

- **First part of the trip:**
  - Speed = 60 mph
  - Time = 2 hours
  - Distance = Speed × Time
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Second part of the trip:**
  - Speed = 30 mph
  - Time = 1 hour
  - Distance = Speed × Time
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total distance covered.
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.
- First part of the trip took 2 hours.
- Second part of the trip took 1 hour.
\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the average speed.
Average speed is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
Substitute the values from Steps 2 and 3 into the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

### Conclusion:
The car's average speed during this trip is \( \boxed{50 \text{ mph}} \).<|im_end|>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the value of Jenna's initial sapphires**

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires.

- Value of one sapphire = $800

So, the total value of 8 sapphires:
\[ \text{Total value} = 8 \times 800 = \$6400 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of rubies Jenna receives from trading sapphires**

Jenna trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.

- Number of rubies received = 2

**Step 3: Calculate the value of the rubies Jenna receives**

Since rubies are worth $1200 each, the value of 2 rubies:
\[ \text{Value of rubies} = 2 \times 1200 = \$2400 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the net change in value of Jenna's jewels**

Jenna initially had $6400 worth of sapphires. After trading, she has $2400 worth of rubies. The net change in value is:
\[ \text{Net change} = \$2400 - \$6400 = -\$4000 \]

This means Jenna loses $4000 in value from her original investment.

**Step 5: Calculate the total value of Jenna's remaining jewels**

Since Jenna lost $4000 from her original investment, we need to subtract this amount from her total value at the beginning:
\[ \text{Final total value} = \$6400 - \$4000 = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} $\$2400$.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

Then find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400
Then amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400

                    question:
                    Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill the raised beds in his vegetable ; garden. He has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 ! feet long by , 2 feet tall. Each bag of ? potting soil holds : 2 cubic feet of soil and costs $12. How much will the potting soil cost him?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how much potting soil Bob will need for his raised beds and calculate the total cost, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed.
- The dimensions of one raised bed are given as 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet high.

\[
\text{Volume of one raised bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
\]

\[
= 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet}
\]

\[
= 32 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume needed for all raised beds.
Bob has 10 raised beds.

\[
\text{Total volume needed} = \text{volume of one raised bed} \times \text{number of raised beds}
\]

\[
= 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 10
\]

\[
= 320 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of bags required.
Each bag contains 2 cubic feet of potting soil.

\[
\text{Number of bags required} = \frac{\text{total volume needed}}{\text{volume per bag}}
\]

\[
= \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}}
\]

\[
= 160 \, \text{bags}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Each bag costs $12.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{number of bags} \times \text{cost per bag}
\]

\[
= 160 \, \text{bags} \times \$12 \, \text{per bag}
\]

\[
= \$1920
\]

### Final Answer:
The total cost for the potting soil will be **\$1920**.<|im_end|>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know that there are 15 red cards.
   - Green cards represent 60% more than red cards.

2. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   - If \( R \) represents the number of red cards (which is 15), then:
     \[
     G = R + 0.6R = 15 + 0.6 \times 15
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     G = 15 + 9 = 24
     \]

3. **Sum the total number of red and green cards:**
   - The total number of red and green cards combined is:
     \[
     Total\ Cards_{red+green} = R + G = 15 + 24 = 39
     \]

4. **Find the number of yellow cards:**
   - Yellow cards are represented by the sum of red and green cards, which is already calculated in step 3:
     \[
     Y = Total\ Cards_{red+green} = 39
     \]

5. **Verify the total number of cards:**
   - To ensure accuracy, add up all three types of cards:
     \[
     Total\ Cards = Red\ Cards + Green\ Cards + Yellow\ Cards = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of fairies**: Katelyn initially sees 50 fairies.

2. **Fairies joining from the east**:
   - One of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did.
   - Half of 50 fairies = 25 fairies.
   - So, after ten minutes, 25 more fairies joined from the east.

3. **Total number of fairies before some fly away**:
   - Initial fairies + new ones from the east = 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

4. **Fairies that fly away**:
   - 30 fairies flew away.

5. **Final count of fairies**:
   - Total number of fairies before some flew away - Fairies that flew away = 75 - 30 = 45.

To determine the percentage of puppies that have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of puppies:**
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.

   Total number of puppies = \( 8 + 12 = 20 \)

2. **Count the number of spotted puppies from both dogs:**
   - From Jennifer's dog: 3 puppies have spots.
   - From Brandon's dog: 4 puppies have spots.

   Total number of spotted puppies = \( 3 + 4 = 7 \)

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies that have spots:**
   The formula to calculate the percentage is:
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed.

1. **Calculate the total weight of sugar cubes:**
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes.
   - Each box contains 1 pound.
   \[
   2 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ pound/box} = 2 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of carrots:**
   - The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots.
   - Each bag contains 12 pounds.
   \[
   4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of hay:**
   - The farmer buys 42 bales of hay.
   - Each bale contains 75 pounds.
   \[
   42 \text{ bales} \times 75 \text{ pounds/bale} = 3150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of oats:**
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats.
   - Each sack contains 65 pounds.
   \[
   20 \text{ sacks} \times 65 \text{ pounds/sack} = 1300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, sum up the weights of all the feeds to find the total amount of feed needed:

\[
\text{Total feed weight} = \text{Sugar cubes} + \text{Carrots} + \text{Hay} + \text{Oats}
\]
\[
= 2 \text{ pounds} + 48 \text{ pounds} + 3150 \text{ pounds} + 1300 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
= 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many trips the farmer needs to make with a truck that can carry 2250 pounds per trip.

Since the truck can carry 2250 pounds per trip, we divide the total feed weight by the capacity of the truck:

\[
\frac{\text{Total feed weight}}{\text{Capacity per trip}}
\]
\[
\frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. 

The final answer is:
\boxed{2}<|im_end|>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of the cans and bottles Grayson consumes in one week:**

   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
     - Grayson drinks 3 cans per week.
     - Total value from cans = \( 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents} \).

   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
     - Grayson drinks 5 bottles per week.
     - Total value from bottles = \( 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents} \).

2. **Add the values together to find the total amount recycled in one week:**
   
   - Total value from cans + Total value from bottles = 
     \( 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents} \).

3. **Calculate the weekly earnings:**

     \( 21 \text{ cents/week} \).

4. **Determine the monthly earnings over four weeks:**

   - Multiply her weekly earnings by 4 weeks:
     
     \( 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents/month} \).

Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Position**: Finley starts at position 1.
   - Current position: 1.

2. **First Change**:
   - Finley falls back 5 spots.
     - New position = 1 - 5 = -4 (negative because positions go from 1 upwards).
     - However, since positions can't be negative in this context, we interpret it as Finley being out of the race.
   
3. **Second Change**:
   - Finley moves ahead 2 spots.
     - New position = -4 + 2 = -2.
     - Again, interpreting it as out of the race.
  
4. **Third Change**:
   - Finley falls behind 3 spots.
     - New position = -2 - 3 = -5.
     - Again, interpreting it as out of the race.

After these changes, Finley has been out of the race for all three steps. Therefore, she finishes in the last possible position, which is 100th place.

**Final Answer**: Finley finished in 100th place.<|im_end|>","Finley started off at 1st place but then lost 5 spots, which translates to 1+5= <<1+5=6>>6th place

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has:**
   - She has six decks of basketball cards.
     \[
     \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150
     \]
   - She also has five boxes of baseball cards.
     \[
     \text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 40 = 200
     \]

2. **Add the number of cards from both types together to get the total number of cards:**
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of cards she keeps for herself from the total number of cards:**
   \[
   \text{Cards given to students} = 350 - 50 = 300
   \]

4. **Divide the number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives to find out how many students there are:**
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = \frac{300}{10} = 30
   \]

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. Kelly bought 20 apples for . 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. How . much more did Kelly . pay than Becky?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Becky and Kelly paid in total after their respective discounts and then find the difference between their payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per apple for Becky
Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- Cost per apple for Becky = $0.45

Total cost for Becky before any discount:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.45 \]

Let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 2: Apply the discount to Becky’s purchase
Becky received a $1 discount on her total purchase.
\[ \text{Discounted amount} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]
\[ \text{Final cost for Becky} = 9 - 1 \]

Let's perform the subtraction:

\[ \text{Final cost for Becky} = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per apple for Kelly
Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- Cost per apple for Kelly = $0.50

Total cost for Kelly before any discount:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.50 \]

Let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount to Kelly’s purchase
Kelly received a 10% discount on her total purchase.
- Discount percentage = 10%
- Discount amount = \( \frac{10}{100} \times 10 \)

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]
\[ \text{Final cost for Kelly} = 10 - 1 \]

Let's perform the subtraction:

\[ \text{Final cost for Kelly} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 5: Determine the difference in payment between Kelly and Becky
Difference in payment = Final cost for Becky - Final cost for Kelly

Let's perform the subtraction:

\[ \text{Difference} = 8 - 9 \]

Since the result is negative:

\[ \text{Difference} = -1 \]

This indicates that Becky actually paid less than Kelly.

### Conclusion
Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is The final answer is}}
\]<|im_end|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.
Before the discount Kelly would have paid 20 apples x $0.50/apple = $<<20*0.5=10>>10
With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the total number of pieces of laundry Bob needs to do for 80 rooms, we need to break down the components of the laundry items based on the given information:

1. **Comforters**:
   - Each room has 2 sheets.
   - Therefore, each room requires 1 comforter.

2. **Pillow Cases**:
   - There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets per room.
   - Since each room has 2 sheets, it will have \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.

3. **Towels**:
   - There are twice as many towels as pillow cases per room.
   - Since each room has 4 pillow cases, it will have \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now let's calculate the total number of pieces of laundry required for 80 rooms:

- Comforters: 
  - Each room has 1 comforter.
  - For 80 rooms: \(80 \times 1 = 80\)

- Pillow Cases:
  - Each room has 4 pillow cases.
  - For 80 rooms: \(80 \times 4 = 320\)

- Towels:
  - Each room has 8 towels.
  - For 80 rooms: \(80 \times 8 = 640\)

Finally, summing up all these pieces of laundry:
\[ \text{Total Laundry} = \text{(Comforters)} + \text{(Pillow Cases)} + \text{Towels} \]
\[ \text{Total Laundry} = 80 + 320 + 640 = 1040 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The total number of pieces of laundry that Bob needs to do for 80 rooms is 1040.<|im_end|>","First find the number of pillow cases in each room: 2 sheets * 2 pillow cases/sheet = <<2*2=4>>4 pillow cases

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of shoes**:
   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Shoes received on Monday**:
   He receives 5 pairs of shoes.
   Number of shoes after Monday = Initial + Received on Monday = 200 + (5 * 2) = 200 + 10 = 210 shoes.

3. **Shoes gained on Wednesday**:
   He gains 15 more pairs of shoes.
   Number of shoes after Wednesday = Current + Gained on Wednesday = 210 + (15 * 2) = 210 + 30 = 240 shoes.

4. **Shoes gained on Friday**:
   He gains another 30 pairs of shoes.
   Number of shoes after Friday = Current + Gained on Friday = 240 + (30 * 2) = 240 + 60 = 300 shoes.

5. **Total number of shoes before any removal**:
   After all these additions, we add up all his shoes: 
   Total shoes before removal = Shoes after Friday = 300 shoes.

6. **Shoes removed on Saturday**:
   He removes 180 shoes.
   Number of shoes remaining = Total shoes - Removed on Saturday = 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

Therefore, at the end of the week, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes left. 

{The final answer is} 120 shoes.<|im_end|>","If Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday and 15 new pairs on Wednesday, he would have 5+15 = <<5+15=20>>20 new pairs of shoes.

1. Determine the price of the pen.
2. Calculate the price of the piece of paper based on the given relationship.
3. Find out how much money Theo paid in total.
4. Subtract the total payment from the amount she gave to find the change.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Determine the price of the pen
The pen costs $2.

### Step 2: Calculate the price of the piece of paper
According to the problem, the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen.

First, calculate three times the price of the pen:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, subtract $1 from this value to get the price of the piece of paper:
\[ 6 - 1 = 5 \]
So, the piece of paper costs $5.

### Step 3: Find out how much money Theo paid in total
The total amount paid includes the cost of both items plus her contribution to pay the cashier:
\[ \text{Total paid} = \$2 + \$5 = \$7 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total payment from the amount she gave to find the change
The amount Theo gave the cashier is $10. We now subtract the total paid ($7) from this amount to find the change:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of pencils.
- There are 30 students in Marissa's class.
- Each student starts with 10 pencils.
  
\[
\text{Total pencils initially} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Pencils per student}
\]
\[
= 30 \times 10
\]
\[
= 300 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months.
- According to the problem, 1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months.

\[
\text{Pencils used after two months} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Total pencils}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{5} \times 300
\]
\[
= 60 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining pencils after two months.
- Subtract the used pencils from the initial total:

\[
\text{Remaining pencils after two months} = \text{Initial total pencils} - \text{Pencils used}
\]
\[
= 300 - 60
\]
\[
= 240 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.
- The problem states that only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left at the end of the year.

\[
\text{Remaining pencils at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining pencils after two months}
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{3} \times 240
\]
\[
= 80 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final number of pencils left at the end of the year is \( \boxed{80} \).<|im_end|>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat so that he has enough cookies for his snack. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies Matt wants:**
   - Matt wants 5 cookies.

2. **Set up an equation based on the information given about cookies:**
   - The number of cookies Matt can have is half the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, isolate the term involving \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
     \]
   - Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - If Matt eats 6 carrot sticks, then:
     \[
     \text{Number of cookies} = \frac{6}{2} + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
     \]
   - This confirms that Matt will indeed have exactly 5 cookies if he eats 6 carrot sticks.

Therefore, the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat is \(\boxed{6}\).<|im_end|>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit.
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- Each remora is 6 inches long.

Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras.
- There are 2 remoras.
- Each remora is 6 inches long.

Total length of one remora = 6 inches
Since there are two remoras,
Total length of both remoras = 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = 12 inches

Step 3: Add the lengths together.
- Length of the shark = 10 feet
- Total length of remoras = 12 inches (converted from feet)

Combined length = Length of the shark + Total length of remoras
= 10 feet + 12 inches

Step 4: Convert the combined length back to feet if necessary.
- Since 1 foot = 12 inches,
- 1 inch = 1/12 feet

So, 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

Combined length in feet = Length of the shark + 1 foot (total length of remoras)
= 10 feet + 1 foot = 11 feet

Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length represents.
- Combined length = 11 feet
- Length of the shark = 10 feet

Percentage = (Combined length / Length of the shark) * 100%
= (11 feet / 10 feet) * 100%

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of students in the grade.

2. **Understand the given information:**
   - Three-fourths (75%) of students have a desktop computer.
   - The remaining one-fourth (25%) do not have a desktop computer.
   - We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer.

3. **Set up an equation based on the given percentages:**
   Since 25% of the students do not have a desktop computer, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}x = 20
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 \times 4

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days Jason will be walking**:
   - Jason wants to try out for the track team.
   - He plans to do so in three weeks.

2. **Calculate the total number of days in three weeks**:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Three weeks means \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

3. **Determine how many days Jason will walk per week**:
   - Jason wants to walk 4 days a week.

4. **Calculate the total number of days Jason will walk over the three weeks**:
   - Since he walks 4 days a week, over 3 weeks, he will walk \(4 \times 3 = 12\) days.

5. **Find out how many days Jason needs to walk each day**:
   - We know he has to walk a total of 12 days over three weeks.
   - To find out how many days he should walk each day, we divide the total number of days (12) by the number of days he will walk per week (4).

\[
\text{Number of days walked each day} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

6. **Verify that his daily walking schedule meets the requirement**:
   - If he walks 3 days a week, he will cover \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days over three weeks.

Since he has already covered the required 21 days within three weeks, he will not need to exceed this limit.

To determine how many books each child received, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books Sarah bought:**
   - Each book costs $15.
   - Total amount spent is $300.

2. **Find out the total number of books Sarah bought:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Cost per book}}

3. **Determine how many books each child receives:**
   - Sarah has 4 children.
   - She gives them an equal number of books.

4. **Divide the total number of books by the number of children:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of kids in Gina's class:**
   There are 32 kids in her class.

2. **Determine the number of kids who are not allergic to any food:**
   - We know that nine kids are allergic to dairy.
   - Six kids are allergic to peanuts.
   - Three kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts (since they cannot be allergic to neither).

3. **Calculate the number of kids who are allergic to at least one food:**
   Since three kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, we need to subtract them from the sum of those allergic to dairy and peanuts to avoid double-counting.
   
   Let \( D \) represent the number of kids allergic to dairy only, and \( P \) represent the number of kids allergic to peanuts only. The equation for the number of kids allergic to at least one food would be:

\[ D + P + (D + P - 3) = 32 \]

Here, \( D + P \) represents the number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts, but since we have already accounted for the overlap, we add back the three kids who are counted twice.

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[ D + P + D + P - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ 2(D + P) - 3 = 32 \]
   \[ 2(D + P) = 35 \]
   \[ D + P = 17.5 \]

Since \( D + P \) must be an integer, let's correct our approach. The correct equation should account for the overlap directly without needing to simplify further as we will find the total number of kids allergic to at least one food first.

5. **Find the number of kids allergic to at least one food:**
   - Subtract the number of kids allergic to both from the sum of those allergic to dairy and peanuts:
     \[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 kids allergic to at least one food.

6. **Subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one food from the total number of kids:**
   \[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who are not allergic to any food is 20.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people going on the tour. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of groups
The company divides its employees into 3 groups. Each group has 200 employees.
\[ \text{Number of groups} = 3 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees in one group
Each group consists of 200 employees.
\[ \text{Employees per group} = 200 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of employees across all groups
Since there are 3 groups, we multiply the number of employees in one group by the number of groups.
\[ \text{Total employees} = 3 \times 200 \]
\[ \text{Total employees} = 600 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of tour guides for each group
Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.

<|im_start|>waiter
To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate both the cost of the plane tickets and the additional cost due to the hotel being 20% more expensive on weekends.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Calculate the cost of the plane tickets:
   - Each ticket costs $5000.
   - They are going for 3 days.
   - Total cost = Number of tickets * Cost per ticket * Number of days
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 5000 \times 3 = 60000
     \]

#### 2. Calculate the increased cost of the hotel:
   - The normal daily rate is $1500.
   - On weekends, the hotel is 20% more expensive.
   - Increased cost per day = Normal cost + (Normal cost * 20%)
     \[
     \text{Increased cost per day} = 1500 + (1500 \times 0.2) = 1500 + 300 = 1800
     \]
   
#### 3. Calculate the total increase in cost due to the weekend stay:
   - They are staying for 3 days.
   - Total increase in cost = Increased cost per day * Number of days
     \[
     \text{Total increase in cost} = 1800 \times 3 = 5400
     \]

#### 4. Calculate the total cost of the trip:
   - Add the cost of the plane tickets to the total increase in cost.
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 60000 + 5400 = 65400
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total cost of Tom's trip is $\boxed{65400}$.<|im_end|>","The hotel room is 1500*.2=$<<1500*.2=300>>300 more expensive per night than normal

- Jasper has half as many blue paint tubes as Ben.
\[ \text{Jasper's blue paint tubes} = \frac{\text{Ben's blue paint tubes}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow paint tubes Jasper has.
- Ben has 3 tubes of yellow paint.
- Jasper has three times as many yellow paint tubes as Ben.
\[ \text{Jasper's yellow paint tubes} = \text{Ben's yellow paint tubes} \times 3 = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of paint tubes Jasper has.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many songs Luri currently owns**

- We know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
- Gabriel has 20 songs.

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
Thus, Luri has 60 songs.

**Step 2: Calculate how many more songs Luri needs to reach the maximum capacity**

- The total capacity of their media players is 100 songs.
- Luri already has 60 songs.

We find out how many more songs Luri needs:
\[ \text{Songs needed} = 100 - 60 \]

Performing the subtraction:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

So, Luri needs 40 more songs to fill her player completely.

**Step 3: Determine how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel**

- Gabriel can add any number of songs (up to 100).
- Luri needs to add 40 more songs to her current amount.

Since Luri needs exactly 40 more songs, she cannot exceed the limit set by Gabriel who can add up to 100 songs.

Therefore, the difference in the number of songs they can add is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 100 - 40 \]

Performing the calculation:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

**Conclusion**
Luri can add **60 fewer songs** to her player than what Gabriel can add.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}

\( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} \)

\( = \frac{120}{5} \)

\( = 24 \)

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Stetson gives up**

Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats.

Amount given up per orange = $10

Number of oranges eaten = 24

Total amount given up = \( 24 \times 10 \)

Let's calculate this:

\( 24 \times 10 = 240 \)

So, Stetson gives up a total of $240.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: The total amount Stetson gave up is **$240**.<|im_end|>","If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week**
- James runs 12 miles a day.
- He runs for 5 days a week.

Total distance = Daily distance × Number of days per week
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \]

**Step 2: Perform the multiplication to find the total distance**
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

So far, we've calculated that James runs a total of 60 miles in a week.

**Step 3: Determine the time required to cover this distance at his running speed**
- James runs at a rate of 10 miles per hour.

We need to calculate the time (in hours) using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} \]

**Step 4: Perform the division to find the time**
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, James runs for **6 hours** in a week.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the daily oat consumption per horse:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day.
   - Therefore, the daily oat consumption per horse = \( 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \).

2. **Calculate the total daily oat consumption for all horses:**
   - There are 4 horses.
   - So, the total daily oat consumption = \( 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \).

3. **Find out the total oat consumption over 5 days:**
   - The total oat consumption for 5 days = \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Determine how much oats are needed in total:**
   - One bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total amount of oats required (200 pounds) by the amount in one bag (50 pounds).
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \).

5. **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 4 bags of oats.}}

The toy car costs $12.

- Current savings = $4
- Remaining amount needed = Total cost - Current savings
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$12 - \$4 = \$8 \]

So, the child needs an additional $8.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days required
The child saves $2 per day from his allowance.

- Number of days required = Remaining amount / Daily saving
\[ \text{Number of days} = \frac{\$8}{\$2/\text{day}} \]

To determine if Jaime will have enough space to place all his eggs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the trays:**
   - Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
   - Jaime has 2 trays.

\[
2 \text{ trays} \times 24 \text{ eggs/tray} = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

So, the total number of eggs that both trays together can hold is 48 eggs.

2. **Compare the total number of eggs to the available space:**
   - Jaime has 64 eggs.
   - The two trays combined can only hold 48 eggs.

Since 64 (total eggs) > 48 (space available), Jaime will not be able to place all his eggs on the trays.

3. **Determine how many eggs he will not be able to place:**
   - Subtract the maximum number of eggs the trays can hold from the total number of eggs:

\[
64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}
\]

Therefore, Jaime will not be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.

   - We know that the large pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.
   - The small pizza costs $8.

2. **Calculate the total cost for both pizzas:**
   - First, calculate the cost of the large pizza: \( \text{Cost of large pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} \).
   - Then, add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the large pizza to get the total amount spent.

To determine the total cost per individual razor after applying the discounts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of razors:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heather is buying 2 packs.
   - Total razors = \( 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors} \).

2. **Determine the effective price per razor before any discounts:**
   - The original price per pack is $4.00.
   - With the ""buy one get one free"" offer, she effectively gets two razors for the price of one pack.

3. **Calculate the effective price per razor:**
   - Since there are 4 razors in a pack at $4.00, the price per razor is \( \frac{\$4.00}{4} = \$1.00 \).
   - However, because of the promotion, the price per razor is reduced from this amount due to the two-pack deal.
   - Effectively, she pays half the price per razor when purchasing multiple packs together (since it's ""buy one get one free"").

4. **Apply the $2.00 coupon:**
   - After applying the $2.00 coupon, her total savings is $2.00.
   - This means she only needs to pay for 75% of the razors ($2.00 saved out of $4.00 per pack), which amounts to \( \frac{4}{4} \times \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \) or 50 cents per razor.

5. **Final calculation:**
   - If she buys 2 packs at $4.00 each, she saves 50 cents per razor.
   - Therefore, the final cost per razor is \( \$1.00 - \$0.50 = \$0.50 \).

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]<|im_end|>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00

To determine the height of the human pyramid, let's break down the information given:

1. **Height distribution:**
   - There are 10 cheerleaders.
   - 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

2. **Building the pyramid:**
   - We need to arrange the cheerleaders such that there are 4 on the bottom layer, followed by 3 standing on top of these 4, then 2 standing on top of those 3, and finally the shortest girl (who is also at the top).

Let's proceed step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cheerleaders in each layer
- Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders): 
  \[
  \text{Total} = 4 \times 64 \text{ inches} = 256 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Second layer (3 cheerleaders):
  \[
  \text{Total} = 3 \times 64 \text{ inches} = 192 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Third layer (2 cheerleaders):
  \[
  \text{Total} = 2 \times 64 \text{ inches} = 128 \text{ inches}
  \]

- Top layer (1 cheerleader, who is also the shortest):
  \[
  \text{Total} = 1 \times 60 \text{ inches} = 60 \text{ inches}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total height of the pyramid
Add up all the heights from each layer:
\[
\text{Total height} = 256 \text{ inches} + 192 \text{ inches} + 128 \text{ inches} + 60 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
= 636 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the total height to feet
There are 12 inches in a foot, so we convert 636 inches to feet:
\[
\text{Total height in feet} = \frac{636}{12} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[
\boxed{53 \text{ feet}}
\]<|im_end|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

                    question:
                    Brett is 14 years old. In four years ! his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is , now. How old is Angela right now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many years it will take for Angela to be three times as old as Brett**

Brett will be 18 years old in four years (since he is currently 14). Let's call Angela's current age \( A \).

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 3(14) \]

Let's simplify the right side of the equation:
\[ A + 4 = 42 \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ A = 42 - 4 \]
\[ A = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old.

**Step 2: Verify our solution**

We need to check if Angela being 38 years old in four years will make her three times as old as Brett. If so, then she will indeed be three times Brett’s age at that time.

- In four years, Brett will be:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old} \]

- At that time, Angela will be:
\[ 38 \]

And three times Brett’s age should equal Angela’s future age:
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

Since Angela will actually be 38 when Brett is 18, and 54 is not 3 times 18, there seems to be an error in our initial assumption or calculation. However, based on the information given and logical steps, Angela must be 38 years old now.

Therefore, **the final answer is**: The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Four years from now Angela will be 14*3=<<14*3=42>>42.
Right now Angela is 42-4=<<42-4=38>>38 years old.

                    question:
                    Paul is driving a car twice a : day: in the morning, and in the afternoon. He did that for 14 days. Each morning ride cost him about $6, and each afternoon ride, about $2. How much money did he , spend ! on driving ? his car during these two weeks?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on driving over the course of 14 days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Morning Rides:
1. **Number of mornings per day**: Let's assume Paul drives once every morning.
2. **Cost per morning ride**: $6.
3. **Total number of days**: 14.
   - Total number of mornings = Number of days × Mornings per day
     \[
     \text{Total mornings} = 14 \times 1 = 14
     \]
   - Total cost for morning rides = Total number of mornings × Cost per morning ride
     \[
     \text{Total cost for morning rides} = 14 \times 6 = \$84
     \]

#### Afternoon Rides:
1. **Number of afternoons per day**: Let's assume Paul drives once every afternoon.
2. **Cost per afternoon ride**: $2.
3. **Total number of days**: 14.
   - Total number of afternoons = Number of days × Afternoons per day
     \[
     \text{Total afternoons} = 14 \times 1 = 14
     \]
   - Total cost for afternoon rides = Total number of afternoons × Cost per afternoon ride
     \[
     \text{Total cost for afternoon rides} = 14 \times 2 = \$28
     \]

#### Total Cost:
1. **Total cost** for both morning and afternoon rides:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for morning rides} + \text{Total cost for afternoon rides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$84 + \$28 = \$112
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is $\boxed{\$112}$.<|im_end|>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.
Driving in the afternoon, on the other hand, was a cost of 14 * 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28.
So in total Paul spend on driving 84 + 28 = $<<84+28=112>>112.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of oranges each person has:**
   - Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges per box.
     \[
     \text{Oranges from Ashley} = 5 \times 10 = 50
     \]
   
   - Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley.
     \[
     \text{Oranges from Brianne} = 50 + 20 = 70
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges available:**
    \[
    \text{Total oranges} = 50 (from Ashley) + 70 (from Brianne) = 120
    \]

3. **Determine how many pies can be made given that each pie requires 3 oranges:**
    \[
    \text{Number of pies} = \frac{\text{Total oranges}}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
    \]

**Final Answer:** They can make \(40\) Greek orange pies.<|im_end|>","Ashley brought 5 x 10 = <<5*10=50>>50 oranges.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the costs of both venues and then find the point where these costs are equal.

Let's define \( x \) as the number of guests attending the parties.

### Venue A (Flat Fee + Cost Per Guest):
- Flat fee: \$200
- Cost per guest: \$25
- Total cost for \( x \) guests at Venue A = Flat fee + (Cost per guest * Number of guests)
\[ C_A(x) = 200 + 25x \]

### Venue B (Cost Per Guest Only):
- Cost per guest: \$25
- Food included for each guest: \$5 per guest
- Total cost for \( x \) guests at Venue B = Cost per guest * Number of guests + Food cost per guest * Number of guests
\[ C_B(x) = 25x + 5x \]
Simplifying the expression for Venue B,
\[ C_B(x) = 30x \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the costs equal.
Set \( C_A(x) \) equal to \( C_B(x) \):

\[
200 + 25x = 30x
\]

Subtract \( 25x \) from both sides:

\[
200 = 15x
\]

Divide both sides by 15:

\[
x = \frac{200}{15} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33
\]

Since the number of guests must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number because even if it's less than 13.33, having one more guest would make the total cost higher due to the additional food cost per guest. Therefore, \( x = 14 \).

So, **14 guests** are necessary for both venues to have the same total cost.

The final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{14}
\]<|im_end|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                    Together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 : insects. : Lily found 7 more than David. David found half of what Bodhi found. How many insects did Lily find?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( L \) represent the number of insects that Lily found.
   Let \( D \) represent the number of insects that David found.
   Let \( B \) represent the number of insects that Bodhi found.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   We know from the problem statement that together they collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

   Lily found 7 more than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

   David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

3. **Express \( B \) in Terms of \( D \):**
   From the second equation:
   \[
   B = 2D
   \]

4. **Substitute \( B \) into Other Equations:**
   Substitute \( B = 2D \) into the total insects equation:
   \[
   L + D + (2D) = 43
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   L + 3D = 43
   \]

5. **Substitute \( L \) in Terms of \( D \):**
   From the third equation:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]
   Substitute \( L = D + 7 \) into the simplified total insects equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + 3D = 43
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   4D + 7 = 43
   \]

6. **Solve for \( D \):**
   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   4D = 36
   \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[
   D = 9
   \]

7. **Find \( L \) Using \( D \):**
   Substitute \( D = 9 \) back into the equation \( L = D + 7 \):
   \[
   L = 9 + 7
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   L = 16
   \]

8. **Verify Solution:**
   Check if all conditions are satisfied:
   - Total insects: \( L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43 \)
   - Lily's insects: \( L = 16 \)
   - David's insects: \( D = 9 \)
   - Bodhi's insects: \( B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \)

Conclusion: Lily found 16 insects. The final answer is {The final answer is}: Lily found 16 insects.<|im_end|>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much yarn Mariah and her grandmother used together. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of yarn used by Mariah
Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.

- Since there are 364 yards in one skein, Mariah used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Mariah} = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards} \]

### Step 2: Determine the amount of yarn used by Grandma
Grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn.

- Similarly, since there are 364 yards in one skein, Grandma used:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Yarn used by Grandma} = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of yarn used
Now, we add the amounts used by Mariah and Grandma:
\[ \text{Total yarn used} = \text{Yarn used by Mariah} + \text{Yarn used by Grandma} \]
\[ \text{Total yarn used} = 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards} \]

Let's sum these values:
\[ \text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total amount of yarn that Mariah and her grandmother used altogether is:
{The final answer is} 273 yards.<|im_end|>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.

3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the width of the rug.
2. Use the width of the rug to find the length of the couch.

Step 1: Determine the width of the rug.
Given that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair and the chair is 3 feet wide, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Width of the rug} = 8 \text{ feet} \]

Step 2: Calculate the length of the couch.
We know that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. Therefore, we first find twice the width of the rug and then add 2 feet:
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times (\text{Width of the rug}) + 2 \]
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 2 \times (8 \text{ feet}) + 2 \]
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Length of the couch} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per pack of strawberry gum. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount spent on non-strawberry items:**
   - Suzie bought 4 packs of gum.
   - She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
   - The price for these 2 packs is not specified, but we know the total amount spent is $7.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount must be from the other items (grape and green apple).

2. **Calculate the cost per pack of grape gum:**
   - Suzie bought 2 packs of grape gum.
   - The total amount spent on grape gum is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 7 = 3.5 \) dollars.
   - So, the cost per pack of grape gum is \( \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost per pack of green apple gum:**
   - Suzie bought 2 packs of green apple gum.
   - The total amount spent on green apple gum is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 7 = 3.5 \) dollars.
   - So, the cost per pack of green apple gum is \( \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost per pack of strawberry gum:**
   - Suzie bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
   - The total amount spent on strawberry gum is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 7 = 3.5 \) dollars.
   - So, the cost per pack of strawberry gum is \( \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \) dollars.

Therefore, the cost per pack of strawberry gum is \(\boxed{1.75}\).<|im_end|>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

                    question:
                    Frederick is ! making popsicles to sell and to save money he is making his , own popsicle sticks. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He ? has $24 , to buy : wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 : costs $4. A 2 x 8 costs $6. What is the most popsicle sticks he can make if he buys the cheapest : lumber?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make given the constraints on the materials and budget.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate total material available:**
   - From a 2 x 4 piece of wood: 200 sticks.
   - From a 2 x 8 piece of wood: 400 sticks.

   Total material = 200 (from 2 x 4) + 400 (from 2 x 8) = 600 sticks.

2. **Determine the cost of the cheapest lumber:**
   - Cost of 2 x 4 lumber: $4
   - Cost of 2 x 8 lumber: $6
   
   The cheaper option is the 2 x 4 lumber at $4 per stick.

3. **Calculate how much money Frederick spends on the cheapest lumber:**
   - Cost of 2 x 4 lumber = $4 * 600 = $2400

4. **Subtract the spent amount from the total budget:**
   - Total budget: $24
   - Amount spent on lumber: $2400
   
   Since $2400 exceeds the $24 in the budget, Frederick cannot afford to buy any more lumber.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - With the current budget, Frederick cannot purchase enough lumber to meet his needs for popsicle sticks because the total cost of the cheapest lumber ($2400) exceeds his budget ($24).

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} Frederick cannot make any more popsicle sticks given his current budget and options for buying lumber.<|im_end|>","He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6
He can make 1200 sticks with this wood because 6 x 200 = <<6*200=1200>>1200
He can buy four 2 x 8's because 24 / 6 = <<24/6=4>>4
He can make 1600 sticks from this because 4 x 400 = <<4*400=1600>>1600
He can make 1600 sticks if he buys the cheapest lumber because 1600 > 1200

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each dog has 4 legs and each pair of snowshoes covers both feet, we divide the total number of legs (which is equal to the number of dogs) by 2.

\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Total number of legs}}{2} = \frac{6 \times 4}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

So, Mario needs 12 pairs of snowshoes.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 12 \times 12.00 = 144.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is **$144.00**.<|im_end|>","Dogs have 4 legs and a pair is 2 legs so each dog has 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 pair of legs

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Janet can save by purchasing a weekly bus pass instead of taking individual bus trips, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of individual bus trips over one week:**
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
   - Each bus trip costs $2.20.

   \[
   \text{Total cost per day} = 2 \times \$2.20 = \$4.40
   \]

   Since she does this 5 days a week:

   \[
   \text{Total cost per week} = 5 \times \$4.40 = \$22.00
   \]

2. **Compare the weekly cost of bus passes with the weekly cost of bus trips:**

   The cost of the weekly bus pass is given as $20. 

3. **Calculate the savings:**

   Subtract the weekly bus pass cost from the total cost of bus trips:

   \[
   \text{Savings} = \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00
   \]

Therefore, Janet would save $\boxed{\$2.00}$ by buying the weekly bus pass.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information given:

1. The farm has 30 cows.
2. The zoo has some number of sheep (let's call this number \( x \)).
3. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.

From point 3, we can deduce that if the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo must have \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.

4. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.

Since the zoo has \( x \) sheep, the farm would have \( \frac{x}{2} \) sheep.

Now let's find out how many animals the farm and zoo have in total.

First, calculate the total number of animals at the farm:
- Cows: 30
- Sheep: \( \frac{x}{2} \)

Total for the farm = \( 30 + \frac{x}{2} \).

Next, calculate the total number of animals at the zoo:
- Cows: 60
- Sheep: \( x \)

Total for the zoo = \( 60 + x \).

Finally, add both totals together to get the combined count of animals:

\[
\text{Combined Total} = (30 + \frac{x}{2}) + (60 + x)
\]

Simplify this expression:

\[
= 30 + \frac{x}{2} + 60 + x
\]
\[
= 90 + \frac{x}{2} + x
\]
\[
= 90 + \frac{3x}{2}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{90 + \frac{3x}{2}}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
2. Verify that Rose's quantities match the given information.

Step 1: Determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
- We know that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Therefore, if 12 onions correspond to 4 times the quantity Sophia bought, then Sophia must have bought \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) onions.

Now, let's verify this using the second part of the information provided:
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.
- Since 12 onions are equivalent to 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, it means that Sophia also bought 4 potatoes (because 12 onions = 4 × (onions + potatoes)).

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 4 potatoes.

Final Answer: Sophia bought a total of 7 onions and potatoes at the market. {The final answer is} 7.<|im_end|>","The number of onions Sophia bought is 12 / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 onions.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the daily calorie deficit required for Andy to achieve his weight loss goal, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Calories Needed to Lose 30 Pounds
Andy aims to lose 30 pounds. Given that burning 3500 calories equals one pound, we can calculate the total number of calories needed to lose 30 pounds as follows:

\[ \text{Total Calorie Deficit} = 30 \times 3500 \]

### Step 2: Perform the Calculation
Now let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 30 \times 3500 = 105000 \]

So, Andy needs to burn **105,000** calories to lose 30 pounds.

### Step 3: Determine Daily Caloric Requirement
Next, we need to find out how many calories Andy must consume per day to burn off those 105,000 calories over the course of 6 months from December 31st to July 19th.

First, calculate the total number of days in this period:

- From December 31st to January 1st: 1 day
- From January 1st to February 28th: 28 days
- From February 29th to March 31st: 31 days
- From April 1st to June 30th: 30 days
- July 1st to July 19th: 19 days

Adding them up gives us:

\[ 1 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 109 \] days

### Step 4: Calculate Daily Caloric Consumption Required
Since Andy burns 3500 calories per day to lose weight, we can divide the total caloric deficit by the total number of days to find the average daily caloric consumption required:

\[ \text{Daily Caloric Consumption} = \frac{\text{Total Calorie Deficit}}{\text{Total Number of Days}} \]
\[ \text{Daily Caloric Consumption} = \frac{105000}{109} \approx 970 \]

Therefore, Andy should aim to consume approximately **970 calories per day** to meet his daily caloric deficit requirement.

### Final Answer
Andy needs to maintain a **daily caloric deficit of about 970 calories** to reach his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday on July 19th.<|im_end|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the cost of the house.
- \( L \) as the cost of the lot.

From the problem statement, we know that:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

We also know that:
\[ H = 3L \]

Now let's substitute \( H \) in terms of \( L \) into the first equation:

Substitute \( H = 3L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

Solve for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we have the value of \( L \), we can find \( H \):

Since \( H = 3L \):
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

Therefore, the final answer is: The house costs $\boxed{90,000}$.<|im_end|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

                    question:
                    On average Joe throws 25 punches ! per minute.  A fight lasts 5 : rounds of 3 minutes.  How many punches did he throw?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many punches Joe threw in total during the fight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of minutes in one round.
2. Determine the total number of rounds in the fight.
3. Multiply the number of rounds by the duration of each round (in minutes) to find the total time spent fighting.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to the number of punches thrown based on his punching rate.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of minutes in one round
- Each round lasts 3 minutes.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of rounds in the fight
- There are 5 rounds in the fight.

### Step 3: Multiply the number of rounds by the duration of each round
- Total time spent fighting = Number of rounds × Duration of each round
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Convert the total time into the number of punches thrown
- Joe throws an average of 25 punches per minute.
- Therefore, the total number of punches thrown can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total punches} = \text{Total time} \times \text{Punches per minute} \]
\[ \text{Total punches} = 15 \times 25 = 375 \]

Therefore, Joe threw a total of **375 punches** during the fight.<|im_end|>","The fight lasted 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Suzanne made:**
   According to the information provided, Suzanne made 36 cookies.

2. **Calculate the number of cookies Josh made:**
   Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made.
   \[
   \text{Cookies Josh made} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bills Ali has:**
   - Ali has 4 $10 bills.
   - Ali has 6 $20 bills.

   Total number of bills = 4 (from $10) + 6 (from $20) = 10 bills.

2. **Calculate the total value of these bills:**
   - Each $10 bill is worth $10.
   - Each $20 bill is worth $20.

   Value from $10 bills = 4 * $10 = $40.
   Value from $20 bills = 6 * $20 = $120.

   Total value = $40 + $120 = $160.

3. **Ali gives half of this total amount to her sister:**
   - Amount given to sister = $160 / 2 = $80.

4. **Subtract the amount given to her sister from the total amount:**
   - Remaining amount = $160 - $80 = $80.

5. **Ali spends 3/5 of the remaining amount on dinner:**
   - Amount spent on dinner = ($80 * 3/5).

   Calculation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{240}{5} = 48.
   \]

   So, Ali spends $48 on dinner.

6. **Calculate the final amount of money left with Ali:**
   - Final amount = Remaining amount - Amount spent on dinner.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \$80 - \$48 = \$32.
   \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $\boxed{\$32}$.<|im_end|>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40

He then spends 3/5*$80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48 on dinner.
The total amount of money that Ali has now is $80-$48 = $<<80-48=32>>32

"Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house. If Rob takes ? 2 ; hours, how many minutes does Royce take?","<|im_start|>system
You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob to shingle a house. If Rob takes ? 2 ; hours, how many minutes does Royce take?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes:**
   - Rob takes 2 hours.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2 hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Define the variables for Royce's time:**
   Let \( R \) be the number of minutes Royce takes to shingle a house.

3. **Set up the relationship between Royce's and Rob's times:**
   According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time. We can express this as:
   \[
   R = 2 \times (2R + 40)
   \]
   Here, \( 2R \) represents Rob's time, and \( 40 \) represents the additional time Royce takes.

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   Expand and simplify the equation:
   \[
   R = 2(2R + 40)
   \]
   \[
   R = 4R + 80
   \]

5. **Solve for \( R \):**
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \( R \):
   \[
   R - 4R = 80
   \]
   \[
   -3R = 80
   \]
   Divide both sides by -3:
   \[
   R = \frac{80}{-3} = -\frac{80}{3}
   \]

6. **Correct calculation error:**
   The previous step had a sign error. Let's correct it:
   \[
   R = \frac{80}{-3} = -\frac{80}{3}
   \]
   This result seems incorrect because time cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the setup:
   
7. **Re-evaluate the setup:**
   Correctly set up the equation should be:
   \[
   R = 2(R + 40)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   R = 2R + 80
   \]
   Subtract \(2R\) from both sides:
   \[
   R - 2R = 80
   \]
   \[
   -R = 80
   \]
   Multiply both sides by -1:
   \[
   R = -80
   \]

8. **Correct the approach:**
   Let's start over correctly:
   \[
   R = 2(R + 40)
   \]
   Distribute:
   \[
   R = 2R + 80
   \]
   Subtract \(2R\) from both sides:
   \[
   R - 2R = 80
   \]
   \[
   -R = 80
   \]
   Divide by -1:
   \[
   R = -80
   \]

9. **Final calculation:**
   Correcting our initial setup:
   \[
   R = 2(R + 40)
   \]
   Distribute:
   \[
   R = 2R + 80
   \]
   Subtract \(2R\) from both sides:
   \[
   R - 2R = 80
   \]
   \[
   -R = 80
   \]
   Divide by -1:
   \[
   R = -80

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wool needed for each item and then sum it up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Hats:**
   - Each grandchild needs one hat.
   - Number of hats = 3 (for each grandchild).
   - Wool per hat = 2 skeins.
   - Total wool for hats = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins.

2. **Scarves:**
   - Each grandchild needs one scarf.
   - Number of scarves = 3 (for each grandchild).
   - Wool per scarf = 4 skeins.
   - Total wool for scarves = \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins.

3. **Sweaters:**
   - Each grandchild needs one sweater.
   - Number of sweaters = 3 (for each grandchild).
   - Wool per sweater = 12 skeins.
   - Total wool for sweaters = \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins.

4. **Mittens:**
   - Each grandchild needs two pairs of mittens.
   - Number of mittens = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pairs.
   - Wool per pair of mittens = 1 skein.
   - Total wool for mittens = \(6 \times 1 = 6\) skeins.

5. **Socks:**
   - Each grandchild needs two pairs of socks.
   - Number of pairs of socks = \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pairs.
   - Wool per pair of socks = 2 skeins.
   - Total wool for socks = \(6 \times 2 = 12\) skeins.

### Summing Up All Weights:
Now, let's add up all the wool required for each item:
\[ 
\text{Total wool} = (\text{Hats}) + (\text{Scarves}) + (\text{Sweaters}) + (\text{Mittens}) + (\text{Socks}) 
\]
\[ 
\text{Total wool} = 6 + 12 + 36 + 6 + 12 = 78 \text{ skeins}
\]

### Conclusion:
Martha will need to buy a total of 78 skeins of wool to complete the items for all three grandchildren. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 78.<|im_end|>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rows for red tulips:**
   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.
   - Each row contains 6 red tulips.

   To find the number of rows, divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:
   \[
   \text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total number of red tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6}
   \]

   Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips:**
   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
   - Each row contains 8 blue tulips.

   To find the number of rows, divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:
   \[
   \text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total number of blue tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{24}{8}
   \]

   Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]

3. **Determine the limiting factor:**
   - Jackson can only create as many rows as the smaller number represents because he needs both types of tulips to fill all his rows.

Since the number of rows for red tulips (6) is greater than the number of rows for blue tulips (3), the limiting factor is the number of blue tulips.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jackson can plant 3 rows of flowers.<|im_end|>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

                    Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with . 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants ! to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make from her bag of raisins, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of batches Heather can make:**
   - We know that one batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.
   - The total amount of raisins available is 0.27 cups.

Let's calculate the maximum number of batches Heather can make based on the raisins required for one batch:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \left( \frac{\text{Total raisins}}{\text{Raisins per batch}} \right) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \left( \frac{0.27}{\frac{3}{4}} \right) \]

Simplify the division:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 0.27 \times \left( \frac{4}{3} \right) \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 0.27 \times \frac{4}{3} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 0.27 \times 1.333... \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} \approx 0.35 \]

Since Heather cannot make a fraction of a batch, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 0 \]

Therefore, Heather can only make 0 batches of oatmeal cookies because she does not have enough raisins to even complete one batch.

Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 0<|im_end|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.
Thus, she will be able to make (9/3) * 4 = <<9/3*4=12>>12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

                    question:
                    Ada's daily . electric consumption is 12 ! kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts : per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's ! weekly electric bill before ; and after she adds the new device?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's current monthly electricity consumption.
Ada consumes 12 kW/hour per day.

First, calculate her total consumption for one month (assuming 30 days):
\[ \text{Daily consumption} = 12 \, \text{kW/hour} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 360 \, \text{kWh/month} \]

Next, multiply by 4 weeks in a month:
\[ \text{Monthly consumption} = 360 \, \text{kWh/month} \times 4 = 1440 \, \text{kWh/month} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Ada's projected electricity consumption with the new device.
With the addition of the new device, which consumes 2 kW/hour per day, calculate the new daily consumption:
\[ \text{New daily consumption} = 2 \, \text{kW/hour} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{kW/hour/day} \]
Then, calculate the new monthly consumption:
\[ \text{New monthly consumption} = 60 \, \text{kW/hour/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 1800 \, \text{kWh/month} \]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in electricity consumption.
Subtract the original monthly consumption from the new monthly consumption:
\[ \text{Difference} = 1800 \, \text{kWh/month} - 1440 \, \text{kWh/month} = 360 \, \text{kWh/month} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost based on the price of electricity.
Given that 1 kWh costs $1.50:
\[ \text{Cost increase} = 360 \, \text{kWh/month} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$540/month \]

### Final Answer:
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before adding the new device and after it is:
\[
\boxed{\$540}
\]<|im_end|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                    question:
                    If one person can paint . half a house in 5 days, : how many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the painting rate per person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total work done (painting half a house) over 5 days is equivalent to 1 unit of work.

2. **Calculate the total number of units that need to be painted:**
   - We know that we need to paint a whole house, which is considered as 1 unit of work.

3. **Determine the combined painting rate when there are 5 people:**
   - Since one person can paint half a house in 5 days, five people working together should be able to paint more than half a house faster.
   - Let \( R \) represent the painting rate per person per day.
   - The painting rate for 5 people per day will then be \( 5R \).

4. **Set up an equation to find the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Let \( T \) be the time in days it takes for 5 people to paint a whole house.
   - According to the problem, 5 people can paint \( 5 \times 5R = 25R \) amount of work in one day.
   - So, in \( T \) days, they complete \( 25RT \) units of work.

5. **Relate the completed work to the total work needed:**
   - Since the total work needed is 1 unit (to paint a whole house), we have:
     \[
     25RT = 1
     \]

6. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - From the equation above,
     \[
     T = \frac{1}{25R}
     \]
   - This means 5 people can paint a whole house in \( \frac{1}{25} \) of a day.

7. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, \( \frac{1}{25} \) of a day is equal to \( \frac{1}{25} \times 24 \) hours.
   - Simplifying this,
     \[
     \frac{1}{25} \times 24 = \frac{24}{25} \text{ hours}
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The final answer is:
     \[
     \boxed{\frac{24}{25}}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sofas and chairs that both Ophelia and Jenna have, given their relationships and the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 0.5 more sofas than chairs (since she has 2 fewer than her friends).
   
   Let \( C \) represent the number of chairs Ophelia has. Then,
   \[
   20 = C + 0.5
   \]
   Solving for \( C \),
   \[
   C = 20 - 0.5 = 19.5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
   \[
   J_c = 3 \times C
   \]
   Substituting \( C = 19.5 \):
   \[
   J_c = 3 \times 19.5 = 58.5
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sofas Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.

4. **Calculate the number of sofas Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia.
   \[
   J_s = 20 - 2 = 18
   \]

5. **Summarize the results:**
   - Ophelia's sofa count: 20
   - Ophelia's chair count: 19.5
   - Jenna's sofa count: 18
   - Jenna's chair count: 58.5

6. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total sofas:
     \[
     T_s = 20 + 18 = 38
     \]
   - Total chairs:
     \[
     T_c = 19.5 + 58.5 = 78
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]<|im_end|>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas
Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

To determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought without buying the headphone set, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of one CD**: 
   - Tom bought one CD for $4.

2. **Calculate the number of CDs Tom could have bought with his total payment**:
   - Total amount spent: $48.
   - Cost per CD: $4.
   - Number of CDs = Total amount / Cost per CD = 48 ÷ 4 = 12 CDs.

3. **Calculate the number of CDs Tom would be able to buy without the headphone set**:
   - If Tom does not buy the headphone set, he will spend only on one CD.
   - Cost of one CD: $4.
   - Number of CDs = Total amount (excluding headphone) / Cost per CD = 48 ÷ 4 = 12 CDs.

Since Tom can still buy 12 CDs even without the headphone set, there is no additional opportunity to buy more CDs.

To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out over 8 weeks, let's break down the information given:

1. **Calculate the total hours worked during the non-consecutive weeks**:
   - For two consecutive weeks where Josh spent 5 hours each: 
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Add the extra hour spent in another week**:

                    question:
                    Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. . He paid $400 less for the printer than the : computer. If the computer cost $1,100, how much ! did one monitor cost, in dollars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the cost of one monitor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the computer and the printer:**
   - The total amount spent on the computer and the printer is $2,400.
   - We know that the computer costs $1,100.
   - Therefore, the cost of the printer can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of the printer} = \$2,400 - \$1,100 = \$1,300
     \]

2. **Determine the difference between the computer and the printer costs:**
   - According to the information given, the printer costs $400 less than the computer.
   - Since the computer costs $1,100, the printer's cost must be:
     \[
     \text{Cost of the printer} = \$1,100 - \$400 = \$700
     \]
   
3. **Verify the total cost of the computer and the printer:**
   - The sum of the computer and the printer should equal the total amount spent, which is $2,400.
   - Let’s check:
     \[
     \$1,100 + \$700 = \$1,800
     \]
   - This calculation seems incorrect because it does not match the total amount spent ($2,400). It appears there might have been an error in the initial setup or provided values.

Given this discrepancy, let’s re-evaluate the problem statement and ensure all calculations align correctly. 

Revisiting the original problem, if the total cost was indeed $2,400 and the computer cost $1,100, then the correct way to find the printer cost would be:

- Subtracting the computer cost from the total:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} - \text{Computer cost} = \$2,400 - \$1,100 = \$1,300
  \]
  
This indicates the printer cost $1,300, but the condition states that the printer costs $400 less than the computer. Thus, the actual cost of the printer is actually more than previously assumed.

Let’s correct our approach:
- Given the computer costs $1,100 and the printer costs $400 less than the computer, we calculate the printer's cost again:
  \[
  \text{Printer cost} = \$1,100 - \$400 = \$700
  \]
  
However, since the total cost including both items equals $2,400, the remaining amount after subtracting the computer and printer costs (which totals $1,300) should account for the monitor's cost. 

Therefore, the monitor’s cost can now be found by subtracting the combined cost of the computer and printer from the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Monitor cost} = \$2,400 - (\$1,100 + \$700) = \$2,400 - \$1,800 = \$600
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Twenty kids went out on a school trip. In one of the several activities ! they participated in, they were divided ! into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a . scavenger hunt of seashells.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought based on the information given.

1. **Determine the total number of children**: There are 20 kids.
   - This is our starting point.

2. **Divide the kids into two groups**: 
   - Since there are 20 kids, each group will have \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) kids.

3. **Calculate the number of boys**:
   - Boys bring shells during the scavenger hunt.
   - Each boy brings 60 shells.
   - Number of boys = Total number of kids / Number of groups = \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

4. **Calculate the number of shells brought by the boys**:
   - Each boy brings 60 shells.
   - Number of shells brought by boys = \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \).

5. **Calculate the number of shells brought by the girls**:
   - According to the problem, the number of shells brought by the girls is equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times the number of shells the boys brought.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of shells each girl brought.
   - Number of shells brought by each girl = \( x \).
   - Number of shells brought by all girls = \( 10x \).
   - The equation becomes: \( 10x = 600 + (4 \times 60) \).

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Simplify inside the parentheses first: \( 10x = 600 + 240 \).
   - Combine like terms: \( 10x = 840 \).
   - Divide both sides by 10: \( x = \frac{840}{10} = 84 \).

Therefore, each girl brought 84 seashells.

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]<|im_end|>","When they divided, each group had 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 students.
The total number of seashells brought by the boys is 10*60 = <<10*60=600>>600

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine George's original number of candies:**
   - We know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 candies left.
   - Let \( G \) represent the initial number of candies George had.

2. **Set up an equation based on the information given:**
   - After eating 5 candies, George has 3 candies left.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]

3. **Solve for \( G \):**
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate \( G \):
     \[
     G - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5
     \]
     \[
     G = 8
     \]

4. **Calculate Nick's original number of candies:**
   - The problem states that Nick had twice as many candies as George initially.
   - Since George originally had 8 candies, Nick would have:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Nick originally had 16 candies.
   
Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 16 candies.<|im_end|>","George has 3 candies now but he already ate 5. So he had 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 candies at the start.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Chenny, Alyana, and Anne based on the given relationships.

**Step 1: Determine Alyana's age**
Chenny is 10 years old.
Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny.

\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = \text{Chenny's Age} - 4 \]

Substitute Chenny's age:

\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = 10 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Alyana's Age} = 6 \]

So, Alyana is **6 years old**.

**Step 2: Determine Anne's age**
Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.

\[ \text{Anne's Age} = \text{Alyana's Age} + 2 \]

Substitute Alyana's age:

\[ \text{Anne's Age} = 6 + 2 \]

To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the thickness of the second book:**
   - We know that the second book is 50 mm thick.

2. **Calculate the thickness of the third book:**
   - The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book.
     \[
     \text{Thickness of third book} = 50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
     \]

3. **Determine the thickness of the fourth book:**
   - The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book.
     \[
     \text{Thickness of first book} = 31 \text{ mm}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Thickness of fourth book} = 2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}

4. **Sum up the thicknesses of all four books:**
   \[
   \text{Total thickness} = 31 \text{ mm (first book)} + 50 \text{ mm (second book)} + 45 \text{ mm (third book)} + 62 \text{ mm (fourth book)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total thickness} = 31 + 50 + 45 + 62

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to produce in order to reach her goal of making 72 vlogs per month.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of vlogs made so far:**
   - First week: 18 vlogs
   - Second week: 21 vlogs
   - Third week: 15 vlogs

   Total = 18 + 21 + 15

2. **Sum up these values:**
   \[
   18 + 21 + 15 = 54
   \]

3. **Determine how many vlogs are still needed:**
   - Goal: 72 vlogs per month
   - Vlogs already made: 54 vlogs

   Number of vlogs still needed = 72 - 54

4. **Perform the subtraction:**
   \[
   72 - 54 = 18

Therefore, Emma needs to make an additional **18** vlogs to meet her monthly goal.

Final Answer: The final answer is: The final answer is 18.<|im_end|>","Emma was able to make 18 + 21 + 15 = <<18+21+15=54>>54 vlogs for 3 weeks.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount for the extra 20% tip:**
   - The original bill is $50.
   - She wants to add an extra 20% tip.

   \[
   \text{Tip Amount} = 50 \times (20\% / 100) = 50 \times 0.2 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount including the tip:**
   - Add the tip to the original bill.

   \[
   \text{Total Bill Including Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

3. **Divide the total bill by two to determine my share:**
   - Since she wants us to split the check evenly, divide the total bill by two.

   \[
   \text{My Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

4. **Verify that the remaining half covers the rest of her bill:**
   - Double-check that my share ($30) plus hers should equal the total bill.

   \[
   \text{Her Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

Conclusion:
- After calculating, you ended up paying $30 out of the total bill which was $60.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much each boy originally received.
Since $18 is divided among 3 boys, each boy receives:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount each boy has after adding their share plus an additional amount on the next day.
Eldest boy's initial contribution (before any additions):
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]
Next day, he adds another $10:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

So, the eldest boy ends up with $21.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount remaining after the eldest boy spends $8.
After spending $8, the eldest boy has:
\[ 21 - 8 = 13 \]

### Step 4: Triple the amount that remains after spending $8.
Triple the amount:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Elvis's savings goal for the second half of the month.

Elvis wants to save twice as much as his current monthly saving target of $1125. Therefore, we calculate:
\[ \text{Target for the second half} = 2 \times \$1125 = \$2250 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of days in the second half of the month.

There are 30 days in April. The second half includes days from May 7th to May 31st. Thus, there are:
\[ 31 - 7 + 1 = 25 \text{ days} \]

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given conditions.

Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves per day in the second half of the month. Since he wants to save twice as much as he currently saves ($1125), he will also save \( 2x \) dollars per day in the first half of the month.

Since the second half of the month consists of 25 days, the total savings for the second half should equal his target of $2250. This gives us the equation:
\[ 25x = 2250 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).

We can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 25:
\[ x = \frac{2250}{25} \]
\[ x = 90 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $90 per day in the second half of the month.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$90}
\]<|im_end|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half

Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125

2. Calculate the total cost of the oranges.
3. Calculate the total cost of the peaches.
4. Add up all the costs to get the total amount spent.
5. Subtract the total amount spent from the amount given to find the change.

Let's go through each step in detail:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the apples**
- Number of apples = 3
- Cost per apple = $1.50
\[ \text{Total cost of apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the oranges**
- Number of oranges = 5
- Cost per orange = $0.80
\[ \text{Total cost of oranges} = 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the peaches**
- Number of peaches = 6
- Cost per peach = $0.75
\[ \text{Total cost of peaches} = 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50 \]

**Step 4: Add up all the costs to get the total amount spent**
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of apples} + \text{Total cost of oranges} + \text{Total cost of peaches} \]
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00 \]

**Step 5: Subtract the total amount spent from the amount given to find the change**
- Amount given = $20
\[ \text{Change} = 20 - 13.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the change that Verna received is **$7.00**.<|im_end|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives.

2. **Set Up Proportion:**
   According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. This can be written as:
   \[
   J = 4B
   \]
   where \( J \) represents the amount of money Jeff receives.

3. **Total Money Equation:**
   The total amount of money they have together is $100. Therefore:
   \[
   J + B = 100
   \]

4. **Substitute \( J \) from Step 2 into Total Money Equation:**
   Substitute \( J = 4B \) into the equation \( J + B = 100 \):
   \[
   4B + B = 100
   \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms on the left side:
   \[
   5B = 100
   \]

6. **Solve for \( B \):**
   Divide both sides by 5 to find \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]
   So, Brad receives $20.

7. **Find \( J \) using \( J = 4B \):**
   Now that we know \( B = 20 \), substitute it back into \( J = 4B \):
   \[
   J = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
   So, Jeff receives $80.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{80}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Jeff walks in a week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Distance from home to work:**
   - Jeff's work is 3 miles away.
   - He walks there and back each day.

2. **Calculate one round trip:**
   - One way (to work) = 3 miles
   - Round trip = 3 miles + 3 miles = 6 miles

3. **Number of days Jeff works in a week:**
   - Jeff works 5 times a week.

4. **Total number of round trips per week:**
   - Total round trips = Number of days worked × Round trip per day
   - Total round trips = 5 × 6 miles = 30 miles

Therefore, the final answer is: 
{The final answer is} 30 miles.<|im_end|>","He has to walk 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per workday
