                    question:
                    Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning ; and bakes muffins for her friends every ? day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market , daily for $2 per ? fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the : farmers' market?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total eggs laid per day.
Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet eats for breakfast.
She eats 3 eggs per morning.

### Step 3: Subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast from the total eggs laid to find out how many eggs are left after breakfast.
Total eggs - Eggs eaten for breakfast = Eggs remaining after breakfast

\[ \text{Eggs remaining} = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many eggs Janet uses for baking muffins.
She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.

### Step 5: Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins from the eggs remaining after breakfast.
Remaining eggs - Eggs used for baking muffins = Eggs available for selling

\[ \text{Eggs available for selling} = 13 - 4 = 9 \]

### Step 6: Calculate how much money Janet makes from selling these eggs at the market.
Each egg sells for $2.

So, the amount of money made from selling the remaining eggs at the market is:

\[ \text{Money made} = \text{Number of eggs sold} \times \text{Price per egg} \]
\[ \text{Money made} = 9 \times \$2 = \$18 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Janet makes \$18 every day at the farmers' market.<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer’s market.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Identify the quantities involved:**
   - Blue fiber: \( \frac{1}{2} \) bolt for every 1 bolt of white fiber.
   - White fiber: 1 bolt.

2. **Determine the relationship between blue and white fibers:**
   - For every 1 bolt of white fiber, there is \( \frac{1}{2} \) bolt of blue fiber.

3. **Calculate the total number of bolts needed:**
   - If we need 1 bolt of white fiber, then we also need \( \frac{1}{2} \) bolt of blue fiber.
   - Therefore, if we have 4 bolts of white fiber (since 1 + \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 4 \)), we would need \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) bolts of blue fiber.

So, the total number of bolts required to make one robe is 2 bolts of blue fiber plus 1 bolt of white fiber.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 3 bolts in total.<|im_end|>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine Josh's profit from the house flip, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment**

Josh bought the house for $80,000 and put an additional $50,000 into repairs.

\[ \text{Total Investment} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the increase in value due to the renovation**

The value of the house increased by 150%.

First, convert this percentage to a decimal for easier calculation:

\[ 150\% = 1.5 \]

Next, calculate the amount of money that represents the increase in value:

\[ \text{Increase in Value} = \$130,000 \times 1.5 = \$195,000 \]

**Step 3: Add the increase in value to the original purchase price**

Now, add the increase in value to the original purchase price to find the total amount Josh paid for the house after renovations:

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$80,000 + \$195,000 = \$275,000 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total investment from the total amount paid**

Finally, subtract the total investment from the total amount paid to find the profit:

\[ \text{Profit} = \$275,000 - \$130,000 = \$145,000 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: **$\boxed{\$145,000}$**<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sprints per week:**
   - James runs 3 sprints every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of sprints per week = \(3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week}\).

2. **Calculate the total distance for one sprint:**
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.

3. **Calculate the total distance for all sprints in a week:**
   - Total distance per sprint = 60 meters.
   - Number of sprints per week = \(3 \times 7\).
   - Therefore, the total distance per week = \(60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times (3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week})\).

Let's do the math:

\[ \text{Total distance per sprint} = 60 \text{ meters} \]
\[ \text{Number of sprints per week} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ sprints} \]
\[ \text{Total distance per week} = 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 21 \text{ sprints} \]

\[ \text{Total distance per week} = 1260 \text{ meters} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of chickens fed per day.
- There are 20 chickens.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed given during the morning session.
- The morning session gives 15 cups of feed for 20 chickens.
- Each chicken gets \( \frac{15}{20} = 0.75 \) cups of feed per session.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed given during the afternoon session.
- The afternoon session gives 25 cups of feed for 20 chickens.
- Each chicken gets \( \frac{25}{20} = 1.25 \) cups of feed per session.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of feed given during the morning and afternoon sessions.
- Morning session: \( 15 \times 0.75 = 11.25 \) cups.
- Afternoon session: \( 25 \times 1.25 = 31.25 \) cups.
- Total feed given so far: \( 11.25 + 31.25 = 42.5 \) cups.

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining feed needed for the final meal.
- Since the total feed available for the day is not specified, we assume that all 42.5 cups have been used up until now.
- Therefore, no additional feed is needed for the final meal because the total feed provided (42.5 cups) has already covered the needs of the chickens for the entire day.

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per glass**
- The first glass costs $5.
- Every other glass costs only 60% of the price of the previous one.

Let's calculate the cost of the first two glasses:
- Cost of the first glass = $5
- Cost of the second glass (which is 60% of the first) = $5 * 0.60 = $3

So, the total cost for the first four glasses would be:
\[ \text{Total} = \$5 + \$3 = \$8 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many groups of four glasses Kylar can afford**
- He has 16 glasses in total.
- Each group consists of 4 glasses.

Number of groups = Total number of glasses / Number of glasses per group
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of groups**
- Each group costs $8.
- There are 4 groups.

Total cost = Number of groups * Cost per group
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times \$8 = \$32 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for all 16 glasses is **$32**.<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheep each city has based on the given relationships between them. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.

2. **Calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the problem, Charleston has four times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Since Seattle has 20 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Charleston as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times (\text{Sheep in Seattle}) = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - The problem states that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Since Charleston has 80 sheep, we can calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times (\text{Sheep in Charleston}) = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

Now, let's sum up the total number of sheep for all three cities:

\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Toulouse} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Seattle}
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together is \(260\).

**The final answer is:** 260.<|im_end|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep
Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which is 2 * 80 sheep = <<2*80=160>>160 sheep
Together, the three has 20 sheep + 160 sheep + 80 sheep = <<20+160+80=260>>260 sheep

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the time taken to download the first half of the file:**
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB per minute.
   - Therefore, the time to download the first half (100 GB) at her normal speed is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Size}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Account for the delay due to the system restart:**
   - The system restart takes 20 minutes.

3. **Calculate the remaining time after the restart:**
   - After the restart, Carla needs to start again from the beginning.
   - She already spent 70 minutes (50 minutes downloading + 20 minutes restarting).
   - So, the remaining time to complete the rest of the file is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Size} - (\text{Downloaded Size} + \text{Rest Time}) = 200 \text{ GB} - (100 \text{ GB} + 20 \text{ minutes})
     \]
   - Since 20 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour (60 minutes), we convert this to hours:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Time} = 200 \text{ GB} - (100 \text{ GB} + 1 \text{ hour}) = 200 \text{ GB} - 101 \text{ GB} = 99 \text{ GB}
     \]

4. **Calculate the new download rate after the restart:**
   - Carla now has 2 GB left to download in 60 minutes (since the restart took 1 hour).

So, the new download rate is:
\[
\text{New Download Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ GB}}{60 \text{ min}} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ GB/min}
\]

5. **Calculate the time needed to download the remaining 99 GB at the new rate:**
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Size}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{99 \text{ GB}}{\frac{1}{30} \text{ GB/min}} = 99 \times 30 = 2970 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time to download the entire file after the restart is:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time before restart} + \text{Time after restart} = 70 \text{ minutes} + 2970 \text{ minutes} = 3040 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate the distance traveled during each segment of John's journey.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time spent: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance covered: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \) miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Time spent: 2 hours (in standstill traffic)
   - Speed: 0 mph (since he doesn't move)
   - Distance covered: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 0 \times 2 = 0 \) miles

3. **Third Segment:**
   - Remaining time available after the first two hours: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \)
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Distance covered: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \) miles

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - Time left to travel at 80 mph: 2 hours
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Distance covered: \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 80 \times 2 = 160 \) miles

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- Total distance covered: 
  \[
  180 \text{ miles (first segment)} + 0 \text{ miles (second segment)} + 60 \text{ miles (third segment)} + 160 \text{ miles (fourth segment)}
  \]
  \[
  = 180 + 0 + 60 + 160 = 300 \text{ miles}

                    Eliza's , rate per hour ; for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are ! her earnings for this week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Eliza's regular hourly wage.
- Regular hourly rate = $10/hour.

### Step 2: Determine if any overtime has been worked.
- Total hours worked = 45 hours.
- Regular working hours = 40 hours.
- Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular working hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the overtime pay.
- Overtime pay rate = 1.2 times the regular hourly rate.
- Overtime pay = Overtime hours × Overtime pay rate.
- Overtime pay = 5 hours × (1.2 × $10/hour) = 5 hours × ($12/hour) = $60.

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings.
- Regular earnings = Regular working hours × Regular hourly rate.
- Regular earnings = 40 hours × $10/hour = $400.
- Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime pay.
- Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's earnings for this week are $\boxed{460}$.<|im_end|>","Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.
Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.
So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.
Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.
Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
2. Calculate the number of downloads in the third month after reducing them by 30%.

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of downloads in the second month
- The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.
- In the second month, the number of downloads is three times that of the first month.
\[ \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times \text{(downloads in the first month)} \]
\[ \text{Downloads in the second month} = 3 \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Downloads in the second month} = 180 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of downloads in the third month
- After the second month, the number of downloads reduces by 30%. This means 70% (or 0.7) of the downloads from the second month remain.
\[ \text{Downloads in the third month} = 0.7 \times \text{(downloads in the second month)} \]
\[ \text{Downloads in the third month} = 0.7 \times 180 \]
\[ \text{Downloads in the third month} = 126 \]

Now, let's sum up all the downloads over the three months:
\[ \text{Total downloads} = \text{Downloads in the first month} + \text{Downloads in the second month} + \text{Downloads in the third month} \]
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126 \]
\[ \text{Total downloads} = 366 \]

Therefore, the total number of downloads for the program over the three months is \( \boxed{366} \).<|im_end|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

In the third month, the number of downloads of the program reduced by 30/100*180 = <<30/100*180=54>>54
There were 180-54 = <<180-54=126>>126 downloads in the third month.

<|im_start|>react
To find out how much Toula spent in total at the bakery, let's break down her purchases:

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - Total cost for donuts = \( 3 \times \$68 \) = \( \$204 \).

2. **Mini Cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - Total cost for mini cupcakes = \( 2 \times \$80 \) = \( \$160 \).

3. **Mini Cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - Total cost for mini cheesecakes = \( 6 \times \$55 \) = \( \$330 \).

Now, let's add up all these amounts to get the total cost.

**Total Cost Calculation:**

- Donuts: \( \$204 \)
- Mini Cupcakes: \( \$160 \)
- Mini Cheesecakes: \( \$330 \)

\[
\$204 + \$160 + \$330 = \$794
\]

Therefore, the total cost Toula incurred at the bakery is:

{The final answer is} \$794.<|im_end|>","The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.

                    question:
                    . Carlos is planting , a lemon tree. The ! tree will . cost $90 to plant. Each : year it , will grow 7 lemons, which he ? can sell ! for $1.5 each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate both the revenue generated from selling the lemons and the expenses associated with growing the tree.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Revenue Calculation:
1. **Leaves per Year:**
   - Each year, the lemon tree grows 7 lemons.
   
2. **Revenue Per Lemon:**
   - Each lemon sells for $1.5.
   
3. **Total Revenue Per Year:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Number of Lemons} \times \text{Price per Lemon}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = 7 \times 1.5 = \$10.50
   \]

4. **Annual Expenses:**
   - Annual water and feeding cost is $3.

5. **Net Profit Per Year:**
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Annual Expenses}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = 10.50 - 3 = \$7.50
   \]

#### Time Calculation:
6. **Initial Cost of Planting:**
   - The initial cost to plant the tree is $90.

7. **Time Required to Earn Net Profit:**
   - To find out how long it takes to earn at least one dollar in profit (since he needs to start making money), divide the total net profit required by the annual net profit:
   \[
   \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Total Net Profit}}{\text{Net Profit Per Year}}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Years} = \frac{90}{7.50} \approx 12
   \]

Therefore, it will take approximately **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.<|im_end|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of vacuum cleaners sold to each house:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
   
2. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the green house:**
   - According to the problem, Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house.
   - Therefore, the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the green house is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{3}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the red house:**
   - The problem states that she sold two more vacuum cleaners to the red house than to the green house.
   - Since she sold two more to the red house, we add 2 to the number sold to the green house:
     \[
     \frac{x}{3} + 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners remaining after selling to both houses:**
   - After selling to the green house, she has:
     \[
     x - \left(\frac{x}{3}\right) = \frac{2x}{3}
     \]
   - After selling to the red house, she has:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right)
     \]
   - Simplify this expression:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 2 = \frac{x}{3} - 2
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house:**
   - It is stated that she sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house.
   - We know that the orange house received:
     \[
     \frac{\frac{x}{3} - 2}{2} = \frac{x}{6} - 1
     \]
   - So, the number of vacuum cleaners sold to the orange house is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{6} - 1
     \]

6. **Set up an equation based on the total number of vacuum cleaners sold:**
   - The total number of vacuum cleaners sold must equal the initial amount:
     \[
     \frac{x}{3} + \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) + \left(\frac{x}{6} - 1\right) = x
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} + \frac{x}{6} + 1 = x
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     \frac{4x}{6} + \frac{x}{6} + 1 = x
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5x}{6} + 1 = x
     \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{5x}{6} = x - 1
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 6:
     \[
     5x = 6(x - 1)
     \]
   - Distribute on the right side:
     \[
     5x = 6x - 6
     \]
   - Subtract 5x from both sides:
     \[
     0 = x - 6
     \]
   - Add 6 to both sides:
     \[
     x = 6
     \]

Therefore, Melanie started with **6** vacuum cleaners.<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - Total number of students = 20
   - Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]

2. **Determine the number of remaining students after contemporary dancers have been accounted for:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16

3. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - Percentage of remaining students enrolled in jazz dance = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4

4. **Determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - Subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dances from the total.
   \[
   \text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = 20 - (4 + 4) = 20 - 8 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine which option maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the expected increase in value for both the jewelry and electronic gadget markets.

### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Increase in Value for Jewelry

- **Initial Value**: Jewelry = $5,000
- **Growth Rate**: Jewelry Market Growth = 2.5%
  
\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$5,000 \times (1 + 0.025) \]

\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$5,000 \times 1.025 \]

\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$5,125 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Expected Increase in Value for Electronic Gadgets

- **Initial Value**: Electronic Gadget = $8,000
- **Growth Rate**: Electronic Gadget Market Growth = 1.2%

\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$8,000 \times (1 + 0.012) \]

\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$8,000 \times 1.012 \]

\[ \text{Expected Increase} = \$8,100 \]

### Step 3: Determine the Profit from Each Option

- **Profit Calculation**:

For Jewelry:
\[ \text{Total Value after growth} = \$5,000 + \$5,125 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$5,125 - \$5,000 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$125 \]

For Electronics:
\[ \text{Total Value after growth} = \$8,000 + \$8,100 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$8,100 - \$8,000 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \$100 \]

### Conclusion

Based on the calculations, purchasing jewelry yields a higher profit compared to purchasing electronics. Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the first day when the trains are traveling eastward, and the second day when they are traveling northward.

### Day 1 (Eastward Travel)
1. **Distance Covered on Day 1**:
   - Both trains start from the same point.
   - Each train travels for 80 miles eastward.
   
   Therefore, the total distance covered by each train on Day 1 is:
   \[
   80 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Day 2 (Northward Travel)
2. **Distance Covered on Day 2**:
   - After Day 1, the trains continue their journey northward.
   - On Day 2, each train covers 150 miles northward.

   Therefore, the total distance covered by each train on Day 2 is:
   \[
   150 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total Distance Covered by Each Train Over Two Days**:
   - Total distance = Distance traveled on Day 1 + Distance traveled on Day 2
   - Since both trains cover the same distances separately:

     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train over the two days is \(\boxed{230}\) miles.<|im_end|>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate both her earnings from teaching and her earnings from being a cheerleading coach, then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Earnings
- **Earnings from Teaching**: 
  - Jill earns $20 per hour.
  - She works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
  
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings (Teaching)} = \$20 \times 35 \]

\[
= \$700
\]

- **Earnings from Cheerleading Coaching**:
  - Jill earns $30 per hour.
  - She works 15 hours per week as a cheerleader coach.
  
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings (Cheerleading Coach)} = \$30 \times 15 \]

\[
= \$450
\]

### Step 2: Total Weekly Earnings
Add the weekly earnings from both jobs:

\[ \text{Total Weekly Earnings} = \$700 + \$450 \]

\[
= \$1150
\]

### Step 3: Annual Salary Calculation
Multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year (50):

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$1150 \times 50 \]

\[
= \$57,500
\]

### Final Answer:
Jill's annual salary is $\boxed{57500}$.<|im_end|>","First find the total amount Jill makes per week teaching: $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $<<20*35=700>>700/week
Then find the total amount Jill makes per week coaching: $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $<<30*15=450>>450/week
Then add those two amounts to find the total amount Jill makes per week: $700/week + $450/week = $<<700+450=1150>>1150/week
Then multiply that number by the number of weeks Jill works in a year to find her annual salary: $1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $<<1150*50=57500>>57,500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day:**
   - Claire makes an omelet that contains 3 eggs.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs used over one week (7 days):**
   - Since she eats 3 eggs per day,
     \[
     \text{Eggs per week} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the total weekly egg consumption to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
     \[
     \text{Number of dozens per week} = \frac{21}{12} = 1.75 \text{ dozens}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed over 4 weeks:**
   - Multiply the weekly consumption by 4:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs in 4 weeks} = 1.75 \times 4 = 7 \text{ dozen}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Claire will consume 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","She eats 3 eggs every day and there are 7 days in a week so she eats 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 eggs a week

                    question:
                    Marissa is ; hiking a ? 12-mile ? trail. ? She took , 1 hour ? to walk . the first 4 miles, then . another hour to walk the next two ; miles. If , she wants , her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to ; walk the remaining distance?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time taken for the hike.
Marissa has already walked for 1 hour.

Total time = 1 hour + [1 hour] = 2 hours

### Step 2: Determine the remaining distance.
The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.

Distance covered so far = 4 miles (first part) + 2 miles (second part) = 6 miles

Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance covered = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

### Step 3: Use the desired average speed to find out how much time needs to be spent on the remaining distance.
Desired average speed = 4 miles/hour

Let \( v \) be the required walking speed in miles per hour.

Time needed at the desired average speed = Remaining distance / Desired average speed
\[ Time_{remaining} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Find out the additional time needed after covering the first parts of the trail.
Additional time needed = Total time - Time already spent = 2 hours - 1 hour = 1 hour

Since Marissa will spend an extra hour walking the remaining distance at the desired average speed, we can confirm that her new speed should be such that she covers the remaining distance in the correct amount of time.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **4 miles per hour** to achieve her goal of maintaining an average speed of 4 miles per hour throughout the entire hike.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

Now figure out how much distance she has left by subtracting the distance she already traveled from the total distance: 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = <<12-4-2=6>>6 miles
Now divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to find out how fast in miles per hour Marissa has to travel: 6 miles / 1 hour = <<6/1=6>>6 mph

                    question:
                    I have 10 liters of orange drink that are ; two-thirds water and I wish to add it : to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water is left after pouring out some of the orange drink and accounting for the spilled part. Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of orange drink needed.
We start with 10 liters of orange drink. We want to mix this with 15 liters of pineapple juice.

Let \( x \) be the amount (in liters) of orange drink added from the initial 10 liters. Then,
\[ x = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, we will add approximately 6.67 liters of orange juice to the 15 liters of pineapple juice.

### Step 2: Determine the total volume of orange drink before spilling.
After adding the orange juice, we get:
\[ 10 + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{30}{3} + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67 \text{ liters} \]

However, we spill 1 liter of orange juice. So, the effective amount of orange juice used is:
\[ 16.67 - 1 = 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Determine the amount of water in the orange drink.
The orange drink initially has \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its volume being water. Therefore, the volume of water in the orange drink is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{50}{3} = \frac{100}{9} \approx 11.11 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 4: Determine the volume of water in the pineapple juice.
The pineapple juice initially has \(\frac{3}{5}\) of its volume being water. Therefore, the volume of water in the pineapple juice is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 5: Combine the volumes of water from both drinks.
The total volume of water in the mixed drink is:
\[ \frac{100}{9} + 9 \]
Convert 9 to a fraction with denominator 9:
\[ 9 = \frac{81}{9} \]
Thus,
\[ \frac{100}{9} + \frac{81}{9} = \frac{181}{9} \approx 20.11 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of mixed drink is approximately **20.11 liters**.<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine when Raymond's son was born based on the information provided about their ages.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine Samantha's birth year:**
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Let \( S \) represent Samantha's current age (31).

2. **Calculate Raymond's birth year:**
   - Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, let \( R \) represent Raymond’s birth year.
   - We know that \( R = S - 6 \).
   - Substitute \( S = 31 \):
     \[
     R = 31 - 6 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, Raymond was born in the year 25.

3. **Determine the number of years between Samantha and Raymond:**
   - The difference in their ages is 8 years (since \( S = R + 8 \)).

4. **Determine the number of years since Samantha was 23:**
   - According to the problem, Raymond has a son who is 23 years old.
   - Subtract the time difference from Samantha's age to find out how many years have passed since she became pregnant.

5. **Find out when Raymond's son was born:**
   - Calculate the number of years since Samantha was 23.
   - Subtract this value from the total difference in their ages (8 years).
   - Add this result back to Samantha's current age (31) to get her current age.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Difference in ages: \( S - R = 31 - 25 = 6 \) years.

2. Time since Samantha was 23: 
\[ T_{\text{Samantha}} = 23 - 6 = 17 \] years.

3. Number of years since Raymond was born:
\[ 8 \]

4. Since Samantha is now 31, subtract the time since she was 23 from her current age:
\[ 31 - 17 = 14 \] years.

So, Raymond's son was born \( 14 \) years ago.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 14.<|im_end|>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the discounted price to find the original price. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The book cost Kyle $19.50 after a 25% discount.
   - We need to determine the original price before the discount.

2. **Understand the relationship between the current price and the original price:**
   If the book is currently priced at $19.50 and represents a 75% (or 25%) off sale (since 100% - 25% = 75%), then the current price is 75% of the original price.

3. **Set up an equation to represent the relationship:**
   Let \( P \) be the original price of the book. Since 75% of the original price equals $19.50, we can write:
   \[
   0.75P = 19.50
   \]

4. **Solve for \( P \):**
   To find the original price, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
   \[
   P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
   \]
   Perform the division:
   \[
   P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26
   \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

**Final Answer:** The original price of the book was $\boxed{26}$.<|im_end|>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of chicken! meal**
- Cost of chicken! meal = $12.50

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of milk**
- Number of packs of milk = 4
- Cost per pack of milk = $3
- Total cost of milk = 4 * $3 = $12

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of apples**
- Cost per apple = $1.50
- Number of apples = 4
- Total cost of apples = 4 * $1.50 = $6

**Step 4: Determine how much money was spent on chicken! meal and milk and apples together**
- Total spent so far (chicken meal + milk + apples) = $12.50 + $12 + $6 = $30.50

**Step 5: Subtract the amount already spent from the total amount paid to find out how much was spent on pizzas**
- Total amount paid = $50
- Amount left after spending on chicken meal, milk, and apples = $50 - $30.50 = $19.50

**Step 6: Divide the remaining amount by the price of one box of pizza to find out how many boxes were bought**
- Price of one box of pizza = $8.50
- Number of boxes purchased = $19.50 / $8.50 ≈ 2.3

Since Marie cannot purchase a fraction of a box, she must have bought **2 full boxes of pizza**.

Therefore, the number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered is **2**.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the clothing Mishka bought. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of shorts
Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair costs $16.50.

\[ \text{Total cost for shorts} = 3 \times \$16.50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for shorts} = \$49.50 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of pants
Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair costs $22.50.

\[ \text{Total cost for pants} = 3 \times \$22.50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for pants} = \$67.50 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of shoes
We don't have the price per pair yet, so let's denote that as \( x \).

\[ \text{Total cost for shoes} = 3x \]

### Step 4: Sum up the total cost
Now, we add up the costs from all three categories.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for shorts} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for shoes} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$49.50 + \$67.50 + 3x \]

Since we know the total cost should be $180 (as given in the problem), we can set up an equation:

\[ \$49.50 + \$67.50 + 3x = \$180 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
First, combine the known values:

\[ \$117 + 3x = \$180 \]

Subtract $117 from both sides:

\[ 3x = \$180 - \$117 \]

\[ 3x = \$63 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{\$63}{3} \]

\[ x = \$21 \]

So, one pair of shoes costs $21.

                    question:
                    Cynthia : eats one serving of ice : cream every night.  . She buys cartons , of ice cream with . 15 ! servings of , ice cream ? per carton at ? a cost : of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 ! days, : how ? much will she ; spend on ice , cream?

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of cartons needed for 60 days**
- Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.
- There are 30 nights in a month (assuming an average month has about 30 days).

So, for 60 days:
\[ \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total days}}{\text{Days per carton}} = \frac{60}{30} = 2 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost based on the price per carton**
- Each carton costs $4.00.

So, for 2 cartons:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 \times 4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, Cynthia will spend **$8.00** on ice cream after 60 days.<|im_end|>","Each container of ice cream has 15 servings and she eats 1 serving a night so after 60 days she will need 60/15 = 4 containers of ice cream

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total distance**: The total distance of Henry's trip is given as 60 miles.

2. **Determine the distance from the start to the first stop**:
   - Henry stopped after 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the remaining distance to reach the first stop is \( 60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 40 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the distance from the first stop to the second stop**:
   - Henry's second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - This means that the distance from the first stop to the second stop is the difference between the total trip distance minus the distance from the start to the first stop: 
     \[
     60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} - (60 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles}) = 15 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Verify the calculation**:
   - The distance from the start to the first stop is indeed 20 miles.
   - Subtracting this from the total trip distance gives us 40 miles for the remaining journey.
   - Adding back the 15 miles from the second stop confirms the total journey length: 
     \[
     20 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} = 35 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is **15 miles**.<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the price of one boot.
   - The price of two pairs of high heels together is given as 5 dollars less than the boots.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know that two pairs of high heels cost 5 dollars more than one boot. Therefore, if we denote the price of one pair of high heels as \( H \), then:
     \[
     2H = B + 5
     \]
   - Since there are two pairs of high heels, their total cost can be written as:
     \[
     2H \times 2 = 4H
     \]

3. **Express High Heels' Cost in Terms of Boots:**
   - Given that one pair of high heels costs $33, and another pair costs twice as much (i.e., $66):
     \[
     H = 33 \quad (\text{one pair})
     \]
     \[
     2H = 66 \quad (\text{another pair})
     \]

4. **Substitute into the Equation for Two Pairs of High Heels:**
   - Substitute \( H \) from above into the equation \( 2H = B + 5 \):
     \[
     2 \times 33 = B + 5
     \]
     Simplify this:
     \[
     66 = B + 5
     \]
     Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     B = 61
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The boots cost $\boxed{61}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","The second pair of heels costs 33 * 2 = $<<33*2=66>>66.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
- Their combined current age is 162.

### Step 2: Set up the variables
Let's denote:
- \( D \) as Darrell's age,
- \( A \) as Allen's age.

According to the ratio, we have:
\[ \frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11} \]

This can be written as:
\[ D = \frac{7}{11}A \]

### Step 3: Use the total age equation
We know that their total age is 162:
\[ D + A = 162 \]

Substitute \( D \) from the ratio into the total age equation:
\[ \frac{7}{11}A + A = 162 \]

### Step 4: Combine like terms
Combine the terms involving \( A \):
\[ \left(\frac{7}{11} + 1\right)A = 162 \]
\[ \left(\frac{7}{11} + \frac{11}{11}\right)A = 162 \]
\[ \frac{18}{11}A = 162 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( A \)
Multiply both sides by \(\frac{11}{18}\) to isolate \( A \):
\[ A = 162 \times \frac{11}{18} \]
\[ A = 9 \times 11 \]
\[ A = 99 \]

So, Allen's age is 99 years.

### Step 6: Calculate Allen's age 10 years ago
If Allen is currently 99 years old, then 10 years ago he would have been:
\[ 99 - 10 = 89 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 89.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

If Allen is currently 99 years old, in 10 years he will be 99+10 = <<99+10=109>>109 years old

To find the average guess for the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the second friend's guess**:
   - The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans.
   - The second friend says ""20 more than half the first one.""
   - Half of 80 is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \).
   - Therefore, the second friend guesses \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

2. **Calculate the third friend's guess**:
   - The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans.
   - The third friend says ""25% more than the first one.""
   - 25% of 80 is \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \).
   - Therefore, the third friend guesses \( 80 + 20 = 100 \).

3. **Sum all the guesses**:
   - First friend: 80
   - Second friend: 100
   - Third friend: 100
   - Total sum: \( 80 + 100 + 100 = 280 \)

4. **Divide the total sum by the number of guesses (which is 3)**:
   - Average guess: \( \frac{280}{3} \approx 93.33 \)

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours a week John spends on caring for his dogs, we need to break down the time spent on walking and caring for their business into daily and weekly totals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Daily Time Spent Caring for Dogs

1. **Time per Dog per Day:**
   - Each dog takes **.5** hours per day.
   
2. **Number of Dogs:**
   - John has **10** dogs.

3. **Total Daily Care Time per Dog:**
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. **Daily Total Care Time:**
   - Summing up the total time spent on all dogs:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 10 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

#### Weekly Time Spent Caring for Dogs

John's weekly care time includes both the time spent walking the dogs (which we already calculated) and the time spent caring for their business.

1. **Business Care Time Per Dog per Week:**
   - Each dog takes **.5** hours per day to care for their business.
   - Number of Days in a Week: **7**

2. **Total Business Care Time per Dog per Week:**
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 3.5 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

3. **Weekly Total Business Care Time:**
   - Summing up the total time spent on all dogs:
   \[
   3.5 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

4. **Total Weekly Care Time Including Walking and Business:**
   \[
   50 \text{ hours/week (walking)} + 35 \text{ hours/week (business)} = 85 \text{ hours/week}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.
Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ G + S = 110 \]
and also that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
From these two statements, we can set up our equations:
1. \( G + S = 110 \)
2. \( G = S + 30 \)

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve for One Variable
Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide by 2 to isolate \( S \):
\[ S = 40 \]

### Step 4: Find the Number of Gold Coins
Now substitute \( S = 40 \) back into either equation (2) or (1). Let's use equation (2):
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, let's break this down into steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost per yogurt:**
   - Terry buys 2 yogurts per day.
   - The current price is 4 yogurts for $5.00.

2. **Determine the number of yogurts Terry will buy in 30 days:**
   - Since Terry buys 2 yogurts per day, we multiply the daily amount by 30 to find out how many yogurts he will buy over 30 days.
   
   \[
   2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of yogurts bought:**
   - We know that 4 yogurts cost $5.00.
   - Therefore, if Terry buys 60 yogurts, we can set up a proportion to find the total cost.

   \[
   \frac{5.00}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = \frac{x}{60 \text{ yogurts}}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

   \[
   x = \left(\frac{5.00}{4}\right) \times 60
   \]

5. **Perform the calculation:**

   \[
   x = \left(\frac{5.00 \times 60}{4}\right)

                    question:
                    John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for : $15 each. He ends up buying 8 , video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still ? have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount of money John initially had:**
   - John sells his Lego sets at $15 each.
   - He has 13 Lego sets.
   - Therefore, the total money from selling the Lego sets = \( 13 \times 15 \).

2. **Calculate the total money John made from selling the Lego sets:**
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money John spent on video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games for $20 each.
   - The total cost for the video games = \( 8 \times 20 \).
   
4. **Calculate the total cost for the video games:**
   \[
   8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Subtract the cost of the video games from the total money John made:**
   \[
   195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Verify that there is no remaining money after purchasing the video games:**
   - John has $5 left after buying the video games.

7. **Conclusion about the number of Lego sets John still has:**
   - Since John has exactly $5 left after spending on the video games, it means he sold all 13 Lego sets.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{13}}
\]<|im_end|>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160

He sold 11 lego sets because 11 x 15 = <<11*15=165>>165
He has 2 sets left because 13 - 11 = <<13-11=2>>2

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days John runs:**
   - John runs every week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

2. **Calculate how many days John runs on three consecutive days:**
   - John runs 3 days out of his weekly schedule.

3. **Calculate the remaining days John doesn't run:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week and John runs for 3 days,
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Identify how long John runs on the first day:**
   - John runs for 3 hours on the first day.

5. **Determine how long John runs on the second and third days:**
   - Let \( x \) be the time (in hours) that John runs on the second day.
   - The second day has half the distance of the first day, so \( x = \frac{3}{2} \).

6. **Verify the total running time over the week:**
   - Calculate the total time spent running:
     \[
     3 + x + x = 3 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - This matches the total running time if we consider the distances covered.

7. **Determine the average speed:**
   - Total distance John runs in a week is 60 miles.
   - Time spent running in a week is 6 hours.
   - Average speed (\( v \)) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     v = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     v = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ mph}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ mph}}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Dana's running speed:**
   - We know that Dana runs at a speed four times faster than she walks.
   - Given her skipping speed is half of her running speed.

2. **Convert the given skipping speed to running speed:**
   - Skipping speed = 3 mph (given).
   - Since skipping is half the speed of running, we have:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed}
     \]
   - Substituting the skipping speed:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ mph}
     \]

3. **Calculate Dana's walking speed:**
   - Since running is four times faster than walking:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{\text{Running speed}}{4}
     \]
   - Substituting the running speed:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
     \]

4. **Calculate total distance traveled in six hours:**
   - Time spent running = \(\frac{1}{3}\) of six hours:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Distance covered while running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Time spent walking = \(\frac{2}{3}\) of six hours:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Distance covered while walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} = 15 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}. The total distance Dana travels in six hours is 15 miles.<|im_end|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from Mount Farbo while ensuring she hits the dragon with her gold javelin.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Reach of the Dragon’s Flames:**
   - The dragon's flames can reach up to 1000 feet.
   
2. **Polly's Gold Javelin Range Without Gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet at most because she can ""sleigh"" it (which presumably means teleport or fly) over 400 feet.
   
3. **Effect of Holding the Sapphire Gemstone:**
   - When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times as far as without it.
   
4. **Calculating the Maximum Distance Polly Can Throw With the Gemstone:**
   - Since she throws the javelin three times as far with the gemstone, we multiply her range without the gemstone by 3.
   \[
   400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]
   This calculation shows that with the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, which exceeds the dragon's flames' reach of 1000 feet.

5. **Determining the Safe Distance:**
   - To find out how far Polly can stand from the dragon's flames such that she can still hit the dragon with her javelin, we subtract the maximum reach of the dragon's flames from Polly's throwing distance.
   \[
   1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with her javelin using the gemstone.

### Final Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings in the bag:**
   - We know that 5 servings contain 300g.
   - Therefore, one serving contains \( \frac{300g}{5} = 60g \).

2. **Determine the total number of servings in the entire bag:**
   - Since there are 5 servings in the bag, it contains \( 5 \times 60g = 300g \) of chips.

3. **Calculate the total number of calories in the entire bag:**
   - Each serving contains 250 calories.
   - Therefore, the total number of calories in the entire bag is \( 300g \times 250 \text{ calories/serving} = 75000 \text{ calories} \).

4. **Subtract the calories already consumed from the total calorie intake allowed for the day:**
   - Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
   - You have already consumed 1800 calories.
   - The remaining calorie allowance is \( 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \).

5. **Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can consume with the remaining calories:**
   - One serving contains 250 calories.
   - To reach the remaining 200 calories, you would need \( \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories/serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings} \).

Therefore, based on the information provided, you can eat approximately 0.8 servings of chips before exceeding your daily calorie limit.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 0.8 servings.<|im_end|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on supplies.
Charlie uses one pound of beeswax per 10 candles. Therefore, for 20 candles, he will use \( \frac{20}{10} = 2 \) pounds of beeswax.

Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00 in supplies. So, the total cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the candles.
Charlie sells each candle for $2.00. Since he made 20 candles, the total revenue is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \]

### Step 3: Determine the net profit.
Net profit is calculated as the difference between revenue and the total cost.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. Determine how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.
2. Determine how many articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday.
3. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Articles Written on Monday
Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

#### Step 2: Articles Written on Tuesday
She wrote \(\frac{2}{5}\) more articles on Tuesday than on Monday.

First, calculate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of 5:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Now add that amount to the number of articles written on Monday:
\[
5 + 2 = 7
\]

So, Meredith wrote 7 articles on Tuesday.

#### Step 3: Articles Written on Wednesday
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

Since she wrote 7 articles on Tuesday:
\[
2 \times 7 = 14
\]

So, Meredith wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.

#### Step 4: Total Number of Hours Spent Writing
Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.

Calculate the total number of hours for each day:
- Monday: \(5 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 20 \text{ hours}\)
- Tuesday: \(7 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 28 \text{ hours}\)
- Wednesday: \(14 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 56 \text{ hours}\)

Add up the hours from all three days:
\[
20 \text{ hours (Monday)} + 28 \text{ hours (Tuesday)} + 56 \text{ hours (Wednesday)} = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is \boxed{104}.<|im_end|>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.
The total number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is 5+2 = <<5+2=7>>7
On Wednesday, the number of articles was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday, so it was 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles.
Over the three days, she wrote 5+7 +14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles.
If each article takes her 4 hours to research and write about, she spent 4*26 = <<4*26=104>>104 hours on all the articles.

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: Candice starts with 80 Post-It notes.

2. **Post-It Purchase**: She stops at a store and purchases an additional package containing more Post-It notes.
   - Let's denote the number of Post-It notes in the new package as \( x \).

3. **Total Notes After Purchase**: The total number of Post-It notes after purchasing the new package will be:
   \[
   80 + x
   \]

4. **Post-It Usage**: At work, she places one Post-It note per cup of coffee. We know she has 220 cups of coffee and used 23 Post-It notes. This means she initially had \( 220 + 23 = 243 \) Post-It notes when she started placing them.

5. **Initial Post-It Count**: Since she had 243 Post-It notes when she started, we can write:
   \[
   80 + x = 243
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   x = 243 - 80 = 163
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of Post-It notes in the package that she purchased is:
   \[
   \boxed{163}
   \]<|im_end|>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of blue ties:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blue ties.
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so if he buys \( B \) blue ties, he buys \( 2B \) red ties.

2. **Calculate the total cost for blue ties:**
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - Therefore, the total cost for blue ties is \( 40B \).

3. **Determine how much John spends on red ties:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - If blue ties cost $40 each, then red ties cost \( 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 60 \) dollars each (since 50% increase means multiplying by 1.5).
   - Since he buys \( 2B \) red ties, the total cost for red ties is \( 2B \times 60 = 120B \).

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:**
   - The total amount spent on both blue and red ties is given as $200.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     40B + 120B = 200
     \]
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     160B = 200
     \]
   - Solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{200}{160} = 1.25
     \]

5. **Find out how much John spent on blue ties:**
   - We already know that each blue tie costs $40.
   - So, the total amount spent on blue ties is:
     \[
     40 \times 1.25 = 50
     \]

Therefore, John spent $50 on blue ties.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{John spent } \$50 \text{ on blue ties}}
\]<|im_end|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties
So he bought 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 red ties
Each red tie cost $40 * .5 = $<<40*.5=20>>20 more than blue ties
So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total length of wire available:**
   - Tracy used 4 feet of wire.

2. **Convert the total length from feet to inches:**
   - There are 12 inches in one foot.
   - Therefore, 4 feet = \(4 \times 12\) inches = 48 inches.

3. **Find out how many 6-inch segments can be made from 48 inches:**
   - To find the number of 6-inch segments, divide the total length (in inches) by the length of each segment.
   - Number of segments = \( \frac{48}{6} \).

4. **Perform the division:**
   - \( \frac{48}{6} = 8 \).

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of 6 inches each from the wire.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 8.<|im_end|>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

<|im_start|>subject
To determine the total number of unoccupied units in the building, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.

First, calculate the total number of units:

\[ \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} \]
\[ \text{Total units} = 15 \times 8 \]

\[
\text{Total units} = 120
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many units are occupied.
- \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.

Calculate the number of occupied units:

\[ \text{Occupied units} = \text{Total units} \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \]
\[ \text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) \]

\[
\text{Occupied units} = 90
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to find the number of unoccupied units.

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units}
\]
\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90
\]

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = 30
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of unoccupied units in the building is **30**.<|im_end|>","The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.
If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the total number of occupied units is 3/4 * 120 units = <<3/4*120=90>>90 units.
The total number of unoccupied units is 120 units - 90 units = <<120-90=30>>30 units.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs produced in one day:**
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many days there are in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs produced in one week:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs per week} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Days per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication to find the total number of eggs produced in one week:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs per week} = 1764
   \]

5. **Determine the price Lloyd receives per dozen eggs:**
   - He sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.

6. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens (since the price is given per dozen):**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{1764}{12}
   \]

7. **Perform the division to find the total earnings from selling the eggs:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Price per dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = \left(\frac{1764}{12}\right) \times 2
   \]

8. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 147 \times 2
   \]

9. **Perform the final multiplication to get the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings per week} = 294

                    question:
                    Tom's ! ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  ? He then travels back at a ? rate of , 6 mph.  How long does it ? take , him to get ? back?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Tom to sail back from point 1 to point 2. Here’s how you can break down the problem:

### Step 1: Determine the distance between points 1 and 2.
Since the information about the distance isn't provided in the problem statement, let's denote the distance between points 1 and 2 as \(d\).

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to travel from point 1 to point 2.
Tom's speed when traveling from point 1 to point 2 is given as 10 miles per hour.

Using the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \text{Time}_{1-2} = \frac{d}{10} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time taken to travel back from point 2 to point 1.
Tom's speed when returning is given as 6 miles per hour.

Again using the same formula:
\[ \text{Time}_{2-1} = \frac{d}{6} \]

### Step 4: Add the times together to find the total time taken for the round trip.
Total time taken:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{1-2} + \text{Time}_{2-1} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \left(\frac{d}{10}\right) + \left(\frac{d}{6}\right) \]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression.
Factor out \(d\) from the terms inside the parentheses:
\[ \text{Total Time} = d \times \left(\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{6}\right) \]

Find a common denominator (which is 30):
\[ \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{30}, \quad \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{30} \]

Add these fractions:
\[ \frac{3}{30} + \frac{5}{30} = \frac{8}{30} \]

Simplify the fraction:
\[ \frac{8}{30} = \frac{4}{15} \]

So,
\[ \text{Total Time} = d \times \frac{4}{15} \]

### Conclusion:
The time it takes for Tom to return from point 1 to point 2 is proportional to the distance \(d\) traveled. Therefore, if \(d\) were given, the calculation would be straightforward. Since no specific value for \(d\) was provided, we express the time as:
\[ \boxed{\text{Total Time} = d \times \frac{4}{15}} \]<|im_end|>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the current weight of Uriah's book bag
- Uriah has 30 comic books.
- Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.

So, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

- The remaining weight needed to be removed (since it's ""too heavy"") is 15 pounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the current weight of all items in the book bag
Since we know that removing 7.5 pounds already leaves 15 pounds still needed, let's find out what these items currently weigh together.

Let's denote the weight of Uriah's toys as \( T \).

We know:
- Comic books weigh 7.5 pounds.
- Toys weigh \( T \) pounds.

The sum of the weights of comic books and toys should equal the remaining weight after removing the comic books:
\[ 7.5 + T = 15 \]
Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \]

Therefore, Uriah's toys weigh 7.5 pounds.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of toys needed to remove
Uriah wants to remove 30 comic books. We already know that each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.

So, the total weight of 30 comic books is:
\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

This matches our previous calculation for the total weight of the comic books.

Now, since we have already determined that Uriah needs to remove 7.5 pounds worth of toys to reach his goal of removing 15 pounds from the book bag, and given that each toy also weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, we can calculate the number of toys needed to remove as follows:

\[ \text{Number of toys to remove} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{4}} \]

Simplifying this expression gives us:
\[ \text{Number of toys to remove} = 7.5 \times 4 = 30 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 30 toys from his book bag.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 toys.<|im_end|>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( T \) be the number of truck tires repaired.
- Let \( C \) be the number of car tires repaired.

Given in the problem:
- \( T = 6 \)
- \( C = 4 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Revenue for Each Day
#### Monday (Thursday):
- The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire.
- The mechanic charges $40 per car tire.

Total revenue for Monday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Revenue}_Monday = (T \times \$60) + (C \times \$40) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Revenue}_Monday = (6 \times \$60) + (4 \times \$40) \]
\[ \text{Revenue}_Monday = \$360 + \$160 \]
\[ \text{Revenue}_Monday = \$520 \]

#### Tuesday (Friday):
- The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire.
- The mechanic does not repair any truck tires; only car tires are repaired.

Total revenue for Tuesday can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Revenue}_Tuesday = (C \times \$40) \]

Substituting the given value:
\[ \text{Revenue}_Tuesday = (4 \times \$40) \]
\[ \text{Revenue}_Tuesday = \$160 \]

### Step 3: Compare the Revenues
Now we compare the revenues from both days:
- Revenue on Monday (\$520)
- Revenue on Tuesday (\$160)

To find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Revenue}_Monday - \text{Revenue}_Tuesday \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$520 - \$160 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = \$360 \]

### Final Answer:
The mechanic earned \(\boxed{\$360}\) more on the day with higher revenue.<|im_end|>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

                    The Doubtfire sisters are driving home with 7 ! kittens ; adopted . from the local . animal shelter when ! their ! mother : calls to inform them ; that their two , house cats have just had ? kittens. She says that Patchy, the first cat, ; has ; had thrice the number of adopted kittens, while Trixie, the other ! cat, has had 12. . How many kittens ? does : the Doubtfire family now have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of adopted kittens:**
   - We know there are 7 adopted kittens.

2. **Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has:**
   - Patchy has thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - Therefore, Patchy's kittens = \(3 \times 7\).

3. **Calculate the number of kittens Trixie has:**
   - Trixie has 12 kittens.

4. **Sum up all the kittens to find out how many kittens the Doubfired family now has:**
   - Total kittens = Kittens (Patchy) + Kittens (Trixie)

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of adopted kittens
Given: There are 7 adopted kittens.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has
\( Patchy 's \text{kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kittens Trixie has
Given: Trixie has 12 kittens.

### Step 4: Sum up all the kittens to find out how many kittens the Doubfired family now has
Total kittens = Kittens (Patchy) + Kittens (Trixie)
Total kittens = 21 (Patchy) + 12 (Trixie)

Now let's perform the addition:

\[ 21 + 12 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of kittens in the Doubfired family is 33.

{The final answer is} 33 kittens.<|im_end|>","Patchy has just had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens
Since Trixie's kittens are 12, both cats have 21 +12 = <<21+12=33>>33 kittens.
Combining the adopted kittens with those from the two cats, the Doubtfire family now has 7 + 33 = <<7+33=40>>40 kittens.

   Jean eats 2 lollipops from the initial amount.
   
   Calculation: \( 30 - 2 = 28 \) lollipops left after eating.

3. **Number of lollipops per bag:**
   Jean wants to package the remaining lollipops into groups of 2.

4. **Calculating the number of bags:**
   To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the total number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag.
   
   Calculation: \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \)

5. **Final Answer:**
   Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies within his budget, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost per visit**: 
   - Each movie ticket costs $7.
   - Popcorn costs $7.

   Therefore, the total cost per visit = $7 (movie ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

2. **Determine the total amount available**:
   - Peter has $42 in total.

3. **Divide the total amount by the cost per visit**:
   \[
   \text{Number of visits} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Cost Per Visit}} = \frac{42}{14}
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total weight capacity of the bridge**
- The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

**Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck**
- The combined weight is given as 3755 pounds.

**Step 3: Subtract the combined weight from the bridge's total capacity to find out how much additional weight is allowed**
- Additional weight allowance = Bridge's total capacity - Combined weight
\[ \text{Additional weight allowance} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Additional weight allowance} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many boxes can fit within the remaining weight allowance**
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.
- Number of boxes that can fit = Remaining weight allowance / Weight per box
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}} \]
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = 83 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial delivery fee**:
   - The delivery fee is 25% of the final bill.
   - Final bill = $40.00
   - Delivery fee = 25% of $40.00

\[ \text{Delivery fee} = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00 \]

2. **Add the delivery fee to the final bill**:
   - Initial total before additional charges: $40.00 + $10.00 (delivery fee)

\[ \text{Total after delivery fee} = 40 + 10 = \$50.00 \]

3. **Add the tip to the total**:
   - Tip amount = $4.00
   - Total after adding tip: $50.00 + $4.00

\[ \text{Final total} = 50 + 4 = \$54.00 \]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all charges and tips is $\boxed{\$54.00}$.

Here’s the breakdown in code form as well:

```python
# Initial bill
final_bill = 40.00

# Calculate the delivery fee (25%)
delivery_fee = 0.25 * final_bill

# Add the delivery fee to the final bill
total_after_delivery = final_bill + delivery_fee

# Add the tip ($4.00)
tip = 4.00
total_final_price = total_after_delivery + tip

print(total_final_price)

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 6 clusters.
   - Each cluster contains 20 fruits.
   - There are 67 individual fruits scattered on the bush.

2. **Calculate the number of fruits in the clusters:**
   - We know that each cluster contains 20 fruits.
   - There are 6 clusters.
   - Therefore, the total number of fruits in the clusters is \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \).

3. **Determine the total number of fruits including scattered ones:**
   - The problem states that there are 67 individual fruits scattered on the bush.
   - Adding these to the fruits in the clusters gives us the total number of fruits on the bush:
     \[
     120 + 67 = 187
     \]

4. **Relate the total number of fruits to the number of raspberries:**
   - Since each raspberry consists of one fruit, the total number of raspberries equals the total number of fruits on the bush.
   - Therefore, the total number of raspberries is also 187.

5. **Conclude the final answer:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges in the basket are good. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of unripe oranges.
Given that 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate the number of unripe oranges as follows:
- Total number of oranges = 25
- Percentage of unripe oranges = 20%

Number of unripe oranges = (Percentage / 100) × Total number of oranges
= (20 / 100) × 25
= 0.2 × 25
= 5

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

### Step 2: Determine the number of sour oranges.
We are given that 2 out of the 25 oranges are sour.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of non-good oranges.
Non-good oranges consist of unripe, sour, and bad oranges.

Total number of non-good oranges = Number of unripe oranges + Sour oranges + Bad oranges
= 5 + 2 + 1
= 8

### Step 4: Subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.
Number of good oranges = Total number of oranges - Non-good oranges
= 25 - 8
= 17

Therefore, the number of good oranges is **17**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of good oranges is 17.<|im_end|>","20% of 25 oranges is (20/100)*25 = <<(20/100)*25=5>>5 oranges

The rest which is 25-8 = <<25-8=17>>17 oranges are good

To determine how much Janet paid in total, we need to break down the costs step-by-step.

### Step 1: Cost of Materials
Janet initially spends $500 on materials to make the brooch.

### Step 2: Cost of the Jeweler
Next, she hires a jeweler who charges an additional $800 to construct the brooch.

### Step 3: Insurance Cost
After paying the jeweler, Janet has to pay 10% insurance cost on the total amount already spent (materials + construction).

#### Calculate the Total Amount Spent Before Insurance:
\[
Total\_Amount = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300
\]

#### Calculate the Insurance Cost:
Insurance cost is 10% of the total amount spent before insurance.
\[
Insurance\_Cost = 0.1 \times \$1300 = \$130
\]

### Step 4: Final Total Payment
Add up all the expenses:
- Initial material cost: $500
- Construction cost: $800
- Insurance cost: $130

\[
Total\_Payment = \$500 + \$800 + \$130 = \$1430

To determine Marcy's annual pension after quitting after 30 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money in the pension fund:**
   - Marcy has worked for 40 years.
   - Her annual pension is $50,000.

   \[
   \text{Total Pension Fund} = 40 \times \$50,000 = \$2,000,000
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage increase from 20 years to 30 years:**
   - After working for 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to receive 5% of the remaining value of her pension.

   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = 5\%
   \]

3. **Calculate the new annual pension based on the increased percentage:**

   \[
   \text{New Annual Pension} = 30 \times (1 + 0.05) \times \$50,000
   \]
   
   Simplifying this:

   \[
   \text{New Annual Pension} = 30 \times 1.05 \times \$50,000
   \]

   \[
   \text{New Annual Pension} = 31.5 \times \$50,000
   \]

   \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of months in one year
There are 12 months in one year.

### Step 2: Calculate the length of each ""half"" of the year
Since there are 12 months in a year, each ""half"" would be:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ months} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly cost for each ""half"" of the year
Aleena pays $140 per month. For the first 6 months (each being half), she will pay:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second 6 months (each being half), she will also pay:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for both halves of the year is:
\[ 840 + 840 = 1680 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the discount for the second half of the year
The streaming company offers a 10% discount on the second half of the year. So, we need to find 90% of the total cost for the second half:
\[ 840 \times 0.90 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 5: Subtract the discounted cost from the total cost for both halves
Now, subtract the discounted cost from the total cost calculated in Step 3:
\[ 1680 - 756 = 924 \text{ dollars} \]

### Final Answer
By the end of the year, Aleena has paid a total of **$924** for the streaming service.<|im_end|>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance Sophia can travel before needing to refill:**
   - Sophia needs to add 4 gallons of gas to fill up one tank.
   - Her owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

   Therefore, if she adds 4 gallons to 12 gallons, she will have enough fuel to cover:
   \[
   12 + 4 = 16 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of miles per gallon:**
   - We need to find out how many miles Sophia can travel using 1 gallon of gas (since we already know how much she can travel with 16 gallons).

3. **Find out how many miles Sophia travels per gallon:**
   - Sophia has driven 100 miles after adding 4 gallons.
   
   Since 4 gallons allow her to drive 100 miles, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]
   
   So, Sophia can travel 25 miles per gallon.

4. **Calculate the total miles she can drive with 16 gallons:**
   - Now, we use the information that her tank holds 12 gallons to determine how many miles she can travel with all available gas.

   If she fills up her tank at 12 gallons, she can travel:
   \[
   12 \times 25 = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the time Jim spends reading:**
   - Jim watches TV for 2! hours.
   - He reads for half as long as he watched TV.

2. **Convert the time spent watching TV into minutes (since the final answer will be in minutes):**
   - 2! hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Jim spends reading in minutes:**
   - Reading time = 1/2 * 120 minutes = 60 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time Jim spends reading over his weekly schedule:**
   - Since he reads 3 times a week,
     Time spent reading per week = 3 * 60 minutes = 180 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total time Jim spends reading over 4 weeks:**
   - Total reading time over 4 weeks = 4 * 180 minutes = 720 minutes.

6. **Add the time spent watching TV to the time spent reading:**
   - Time spent watching TV = 120 minutes per day.
   - Total time spent watching TV over 4 weeks = 4 * 120 minutes = 480 minutes.

7. **Sum up all the time spent watching TV and reading over 4 weeks:**
   - Total time spent = 480 minutes (TV) + 720 minutes (reading) = 1200 minutes.

8. **Convert the total time from minutes back to hours:**
   - Total time in hours = 1200 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of individuals involved in the competition across all four schools.

1. **Calculate the number of players on one team:**
   - Each team consists of 5 players.
   
2. **Calculate the number of teams per school:**
   - Each school sends both a girls' and a boys' basketball team.
   
3. **Determine the total number of players across all teams from one school:**
   - Since there are two teams (one for girls and one for boys) and each team has 5 players,
     \[
     \text{Total players per school} = 5 \times 2 = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of players across all schools:**
   - There are four schools, so multiply the number of players per school by the number of schools:
     \[
     \text{Total players across all schools} = 10 \times 4 = 40
     \]

5. **Add the coaches to the total count:**
   - Each school has a coach for each team, which means each school has 2 coaches (one for girls and one for boys).
   - Since there are four schools, the total number of coaches is:
     \[
     \text{Total coaches} = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]

6. **Sum up the total number of individuals (players + coaches):**
   - Add the total number of players to the total number of coaches:
     \[
     \text{Total individuals} = 40 + 8 = 48

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of gems in the chest. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the number of diamonds.
The chest contains 175 diamonds.

### Step 2: Determine the number of rubies.
We know that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:
\[ \text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of emeralds.
We are told that there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies. Therefore, we can find the number of emeralds using the number of rubies:
\[ \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all the gem types.
Now, let's add up all the gems to get the total number of gems in the chest:
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds} \]
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280 \]
\[ \text{Total number of gems} = 695 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{695}\).<|im_end|>","There were 175 - 35 = <<175-35=140>>140 rubies in the treasure chest.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are twice as many boys as girls.
   - There are 60 girls in total.

2. **Determine the number of boys:**
   Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can set up the equation for boys based on the number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of Boys} = 2 \times (\text{Number of Girls})
   \]
   Given that there are 60 girls, substitute 60 into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of Boys} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students (boys + girls):**
   Now that we know the number of boys and girls, we can find the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Total Students} = \text{Number of Boys} + \text{Number of Girls}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total Students} = 120 + 60 = 180
   \]

4. **Determine the number of teachers needed:**
   According to the problem, there are 5 students per teacher. We need to divide the total number of students by 5 to find out how many teachers are required:
   \[
   \text{Number of Teachers} = \frac{\text{Total Students}}{5}
   \]
   Substituting the value we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Number of Teachers} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total allowance received over 8 weeks.
Bailey receives an allowance of $5 per week. Over 8 weeks, her total allowance can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total Allowance} = \text{Allowance per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Total Allowance} = \$5 \times 8 \]

Calculate:

\[ \text{Total Allowance} = \$40 \]

So far, we know that Bailey has spent $40 in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the initial amount of money Bailey had before receiving any allowance.
We are told that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. This means that the sum of her initial amount plus the total allowance equals $100.

Let \( x \) represent the initial amount of money Bailey had. We set up the equation based on the information provided:

\[ x + \text{Total Allowance} = \$100 \]

Substitute the value of the total allowance from Step 1:

\[ x + \$40 = \$100 \]

### Step 3: Solve for the initial amount \( x \).
To find the initial amount \( x \), subtract the total allowance from the total amount of money she ends up with:

\[ x = \$100 - \$40 \]

Calculate:

\[ x = \$60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches over one week and then multiply that by the number of students per class and the amount charged per student.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches.
- Judy teaches 5 classes on weekdays (Monday to Friday).
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturdays.

Total number of classes = Classes on weekdays + Classes on Saturday
= 5 * 5 days + 8 classes
= 25 + 8
= 33 classes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students.
Each class has 15 students.
Total number of students = Number of classes * Students per class
= 33 * 15
= 495 students

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.
Judy charges $15 per student.
Total earnings = Total number of students * Amount charged per student
= 495 * 15
= $7,425

Therefore, Judy makes $7,425 in 1 week from teaching her dance classes.

To determine how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to calculate the total revenue from both items separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Revenue from Brownies:**
   - Tommy sells each brownie for $3.
   - He sells 43 brownies.
   - Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies × Price per brownie
     \[
     \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = \$129
     \]

2. **Calculate Revenue from Cheesecakes:**
   - Tommy sells each cheesecake for $4.
   - He sells 23 cheesecakes.
   - Revenue from cheesecakes = Number of cheesecakes × Price per cheesecake
     \[
     \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = \$92
     \]

3. **Sum the Revenues:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = \$221

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of the cell phones.
Shiela buys 5 cell phones at $150 each.

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total interest on the cell phones.
A 2% interest rate applies to the total cost of the cell phones over 3 months.

\[ \text{Interest Rate} = 2\% = 0.02 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$750 \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = Total Cost \times Interest Rate \]

\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$750 \times 0.02 = \$15 \]

### Step 3: Add the total cost and total interest to find the overall payment.
Add the total cost of the cell phones and the total interest.

\[ \text{Overall Payment} = Total Cost + Total Interest \]
\[ \text{Overall Payment} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

### Step 4: Divide the overall payment by the number of months (3) to find the monthly payment.
Divide the overall payment by 3 to get the monthly payment.

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Overall Payment}}{Number of Months} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} \]

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \$255 \]

### Final Answer:

He usually sells ! marigolds for $2.74 per : pot, petunias ? for $1.87 per : pot : and begonias ? for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round ; all . his prices , to the nearest ? dollar. ; If ; Artie , sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 ! pots , of : petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he ? make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling each type of flower:**
   - Marigolds: \(12 \text{ pots} \times \$2.74 \text{ per pot}\)
   - Petunias: \(9 \text{ pots} \times \$1.87 \text{ per pot}\)
   - Begonias: \(17 \text{ pots} \times \$2.12 \text{ per pot}\)

2. **Sum up the total revenue from all types of flowers:**

3. **Round the total revenue to the nearest dollar:**

4. **Subtract any change (if applicable) from the rounded total revenue:**

Let's go through these calculations one by one.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from each type of flower

- **Marigolds**: 
\[ 12 \text{ pots} \times \$2.74 \text{ per pot} = \$32.88 \]

- **Petunias**:
\[ 9 \text{ pots} \times \$1.87 \text{ per pot} = \$16.83 \]

- **Begonias**:
\[ 17 \text{ pots} \times \$2.12 \text{ per pot} = \$35.74 \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total revenue from all types of flowers

Total Revenue:
\[
\$32.88 + \$16.83 + \$35.74 = \$85.45
\]

### Step 3: Round the total revenue to the nearest dollar

Since the total revenue is already a whole number, rounding it doesn't affect its value.

### Step 4: Subtract any change (if applicable) from the rounded total revenue

Given that there was no change in the initial setup, we can assume there was no change made.

So, the amount Artie makes is simply the total revenue calculated above.

Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$85.45}
\]<|im_end|>","Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18
Artie sells 17 begonias x $2 = $<<17*2=34>>34
Altogether, Artie will make $36 + $18 + $34 = $<<36+18+34=88>>88

                    question:
                    ; Luke is spending time at the beach building sandcastles. , He eventually notices ; that each level ? of a . sandcastle will have half the . square footage as ; the ? level below , it.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Leveling**: Each level of a sandcastle has half the area of the level below.
2. **Initial Condition**: The top (highest) level has an area of 16 square feet.

Let's denote the areas of the levels from bottom to top as \(A_1, A_2, A_3,\) and \(A_4\) respectively for the first four levels. Given that \(A_4 = 16\), we need to find \(A_1, A_2,\) and \(A_3\).

Since each level has half the area of the one below it, we can express this relationship mathematically:
- \(A_4 = \frac{1}{2}A_3\)
- \(A_3 = \frac{1}{2}A_2\)
- \(A_2 = \frac{1}{2}A_1\)

Given \(A_4 = 16\):
\[ A_3 = 2 \times A_4 = 2 \times 16 = 32 \]

Now, using \(A_3 = \frac{1}{2}A_2\):
\[ A_2 = 2 \times A_3 = 2 \times 32 = 64 \]

And finally, using \(A_2 = \frac{1}{2}A_1\):
\[ A_1 = 2 \times A_2 = 2 \times 64 = 128 \]

So, the areas of the four levels in order are: 
\(A_1 = 128\),
\(A_2 = 64\),
\(A_3 = 32\),
\(A_4 = 16\).

To find the average square footage per level, sum these values and divide by 4:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{128 + 64 + 32 + 16}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{240}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 60 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a single level is {The final answer is}: 60 square feet.<|im_end|>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in a year:**
   - There are 365 days in a non-leap year.

2. **Determine the number of days for the first period (first 180 days):**
   - This period lasts exactly 180 days.

3. **Calculate the remaining days after the first 180 days:**
   - Subtract the 180 days from the total 365 days.
     \[
     365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Find out how much dog food is needed during the second period:**
   - The second period starts immediately after the first 180 days, so we assume the dog eats continuously until the end of the year.
   - The dog needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
     \[
     2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups}
     \]

5. **Sum up the total amount of dog food needed for both periods:**
   - Add the amount needed for the first 180 days to the amount needed for the remaining 185 days.
     \[
     180 \text{ days} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ days} \text{ or } 370 \text{ cups}
     \]

6. **Determine how many bags of dog food are required based on the total amount needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
     \[
     \frac{370 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 3.36 \text{ bags}
     \]
     Since Cecilia can't buy a fraction of a bag, she would need to round up to the next whole number because even a small fraction of a bag could be necessary if there's any leftover food that doesn't fill a full bag.
     \[
     \lceil 3.36 \rceil = 4 \text{ bags}
     \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use **4 bags** of dog food in the first year.<|im_end|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

The number of cups of dog food given for the rest of the first year is 185 * 2 = <<185*2=370>>370 cups
The total number of cups given in the first year is 180 + 370 = <<180+370=550>>550 cups

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much laundry each person does based on their relationships to another person's laundry load.

1. **Determine Sarah's Laundry Load:**
   - We know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
   - According to the information given, Sarah’s laundry load (\( S \)) = 4 * \( D \).

2. **Calculate David's Laundry Load:**
   - Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can find out how much David does.
   - Therefore, \( S = 400 \) pounds.
   - Since \( S = 4 \times D \), we have \( 400 = 4 \times D \).
   - Solving for \( D \), we get \( D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds.

3. **Calculate Raymond's Laundry Load:**
   - We know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
   - So, \( R = \frac{1}{2} \times S \).
   - Substituting \( S = 400 \) (from earlier calculations):
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Difference Between Raymond's and David's Laundry Loads:**
   - The difference between Raymond’s and David’s loads is \( R - D \).
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     R - D = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is **100 pounds**.<|im_end|>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better option, we need to calculate the cost of purchasing 18 flowers from both options and then compare them.

**Option A: Buying flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50**

1. Calculate the number of packages needed.
   - Number of packages = Total number of flowers / Flowers per package
   - Number of packages = 18 / 3
   - Number of packages = 6

2. Calculate the total cost.
   - Cost per package = $2.50
   - Total cost = Number of packages * Cost per package
   - Total cost = 6 * $2.50
   - Total cost = $15.00

**Option B: Buying flowers in packages of 2 for $1**

1. Calculate the number of packages needed.
   - Number of packages = Total number of flowers / Flowers per package
   - Number of packages = 18 / 2
   - Number of packages = 9

2. Calculate the total cost.
   - Cost per package = $1
   - Total cost = Number of packages * Cost per package
   - Total cost = 9 * $1
   - Total cost = $9.00

**Step-by-step comparison:**
- Option A (3 flowers per package): Total cost = $15.00
- Option B (2 flowers per package): Total cost = $9.00

Since Option B has a lower total cost ($9.00) compared to Option A ($15.00), Vincent would save money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves by choosing the better option is:

<|im_start|>system
To determine the final cost of the grooming, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the discount.
2. Subtract the discount from the original price.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount
- The original price of the grooming service is $100.
- The discount offered is 30%.

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}\right) \]

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$100 \times \left(\frac{30}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$100 \times 0.30 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$30 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price
- Now that we have calculated the discount amount, we can subtract it from the original price to find the final cost.

\[ \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]

\[ \text{Final Cost} = \$100 - \$30 \]
\[ \text{Final Cost} = \$70 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much water the two girls initially received**

Each girl gets \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total 24 liters.

\[ \text{Amount of water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \]

First calculate the amount each girl receives:

\[ \text{Amount per girl} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ liters} \]

Since there are two girls:

\[ \text{Total for both girls} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the total amount of water given to the girls is **8 liters**.

**Step 2: Calculate how much water the boy has after receiving his share**

A boy got 6 liters of water.

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining water**

Subtract the total amount of water the girls have from the initial amount:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 24 - (8 + 6) \]

Calculate the sum inside parentheses first:

\[ 8 + 6 = 14 \]

Now subtract that sum from the initial amount:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the number of liters of water left is **10 liters**.<|im_end|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many wins the football team had based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( W \) represent the number of wins.
   Let \( L \) represent the number of losses.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   According to the problem, the total number of games played is 22. This can be represented as:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]

3. **Relate Wins and Losses:**
   The problem states that the team won 8 more games than they lost. This relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

4. **Substitute One Equation into Another:**
   Substitute \( L + 8 \) for \( W \) in the first equation:
   \[
   (L + 8) + L = 22
   \]
   Simplify and combine like terms:
   \[
   2L + 8 = 22
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   2L = 14
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   L = 7
   \]

6. **Find \( W \) Using the Relationship Between \( W \) and \( L \):**
   Substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
   \[
   W = 7 + 8
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   W = 15
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 15. The football team won 15 games.<|im_end|>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.
So, 2L = 22 - 8 = 14
So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many vacations Gene has gone on**:
   - Gene has been on four vacations per year for his entire life.
   - Since he turned 23 years old and hasn't reached 35 yet, we can calculate the number of vacations as follows:
     \[
     4 \text{ vacations/year} \times (35 - 23) = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ vacations}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of blocks per year**:
   - For each vacation, Gene makes a new quilt block.
   - Therefore, for every vacation, he will make a new block.
   - With 48 vacations, he will create 48 new blocks.

3. **Sum up all the blocks**:
   - To find the total number of blocks, multiply the number of blocks per year by the total number of vacations.
   - Thus,
     \[
     48 \text{ blocks/year} \times 48 \text{ vacations} = 48^2 = 2304 \text{ blocks}
     \]

So, Gene has a total of 2304 quilt blocks in his quilt.<|im_end|>","Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the alarm rings over the course of a week based on the given information.

### Step 1: Determine the number of rings per day
- The alarm rings three times at regular intervals.
- Each interval between two rings is equal to the total number of rings minus one (e.g., if there are three rings, there are two intervals).

Let's denote:
- \( n \) = Number of days in a week
- \( r \) = Total number of rings in a week

Given that the alarm rings three times every day, let's calculate the total number of rings:

\[
r_{total} = n \times r_{per_day}
\]

where \( r_{per_day} \) is the number of rings per day.

From the information provided:
- On the first day, the alarm rings four times.
- On the second day, the alarm rings three times.
- On the third day, the alarm rings twice.

So, the total number of rings in a week can be calculated as follows:

\[
r_{total} = 3 \times 7 + 4 + 3 + 2
\]

Simplifying the calculation:

\[
r_{total} = 21 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 30
\]

Therefore, the alarm rings **30** times in total during the week.<|im_end|>","The second time Greg’s alarm went off, it rang three times as long as the first, so it rang 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 times the second time.
The third time it went off, it rang half as long as the second, so it rang 12 / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times the third time.
In all, Greg’s alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = <<4+12+6=22>>22 times.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial salary
- Given that each employee receives $600 per month.
- There are typically 24 months in a year.

\[
\text{Initial Salary} = \frac{\$600}{24} = \$25 \text{ (per month)}
\]

### Step 2: Increase the salary by 10%
- To increase the salary by 10%, multiply the monthly salary by 1.10.

\[
\text{Salary After First Year Increase} = \$25 \times 1.10 = \$27.50 \text{ (per month)}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the salary after three more years of service
- Since Sylvie has already been working for 5 years, she will receive an additional year of service from now until she retires or leaves the company.
- For each subsequent year, her salary increases by 10%.

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

#### Year 6 (current year) - Initial Salary Calculation:
- Current salary before any increase: $27.50/month.

#### Year 7 (next year):
- Increase factor: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
- New salary: \( \$27.50 \times 1.10 \)

\[
\$27.50 \times 1.10 = \$30.25 \text{ (per month)}
\]

#### Year 8 (the following year):
- Increase factor: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
- New salary: \( \$30.25 \times 1.10 \)

\[
\$30.25 \times 1.10 = \$33.275 \text{ (per month)}
\]

#### Year 9 (the year after next):
- Increase factor: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
- New salary: \( \$33.275 \times 1.10 \)

\[
\$33.275 \times 1.10 = \$36.5975 \text{ (per month)}
\]

#### Year 10 (the year after the year after next):
- Increase factor: 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
- New salary: \( \$36.5975 \times 1.10 \)

\[
\$36.5975 \times 1.10 = \$40.25725 \text{ (per month)}
\]

### Final Answer:
Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service will be approximately **$40.26** per month.<|im_end|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
According to the problem, Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. Therefore, Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
We know that together, they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( H \)
Divide both sides by 11 to isolate \( H \):
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will attend.
Christina has invited 16 people.

- According to the information provided, only 3 out of every 4 guests actually come to the party (since 1/4 don't show up).

So, let's calculate the total number of attendees:
\[ \text{Total attendees} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Number of invitations} \]

Given that she invited 16 people, we can substitute this into our equation:
\[ \text{Total attendees} = \frac{3}{4} \times 16 \]
\[ \text{Total attendees} = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total attendees} = 12 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of gift bags needed.
Since she wants to give each guest one gift bag, the number of gift bags required equals the number of attendees.

- Therefore, the number of gift bags needed is also 12.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gift bags.
Each gift bag costs $2.

- The total cost for all gift bags would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of gift bags} \times \text{Cost per gift bag} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \]

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the picnic**
- There are 20 adults.
- There are 5 children.

Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of children
= 20 (adults) + 5 (children)
= 25 people

**Step 2: Determine the amount of potato salad needed for one person**
- An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad.
- A child will eat half as much as an adult.

So, a child eats:
\( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \) lbs = 5 lbs per child

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all adults**
- Total amount of potato salad for adults = Number of adults × Amount per adult
= 20 (adults) × 10 lbs/adult
= 200 lbs

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all children**
- Total amount of potato salad for children = Number of children × Amount per child
= 5 (children) × 5 lbs/child
= 25 lbs

**Step 5: Sum up the total amount of potato salad needed for both adults and children**
- Total amount of potato salad needed = Potato salad for adults + Potato salad for children
= 200 lbs (for adults) + 25 lbs (for children)
= 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring **225 pounds of potato salad** to the picnic to ensure there is enough for everyone.<|im_end|>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

   - Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.
   - Therefore, Marcia's number of pets = Cindy's number of pets + 2.
   \[
   \text{Marcia's pets} = 4 + 2 = 6

2. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Therefore, Jan's number of pets = 3 × Marcia's number of pets.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine Jackson's age, we need to establish relationships between the ages of Emily's children based on the given information.

1. **Identify the relationship between Amy and Jackson:**
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Let \( J \) represent Jackson's age.
   - Therefore, Amy's age can be represented as \( J + 5 \).

2. **Identify the relationship between Amy and Corey:**
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Let \( C \) represent Corey's age.
   - Therefore, Amy's age can also be represented as \( C - 2 \).
   
3. **Use the information about James:**
   - James is 10 years old.
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Corey's age can be represented as \( J + 1 \).

4. **Set up an equation using the information from steps 2 and 3:**
   - From step 2, we have \( J + 5 = C - 2 \).
   - Substitute \( C = J + 1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     J + 5 = (J + 1) - 2
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     J + 5 = J + 1 - 2 \implies J + 5 = J - 1
     \]

5. **Solve for \( J \):**
   - Subtract \( J \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     5 = -1
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     6 = 7
     \]
   - We realize there was a mistake in our previous steps; let's correct it:

6. **Correctly set up the equation again:**
   - From step 2, we have \( J + 5 = C - 2 \).
   - Substitute \( C = J + 1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     J + 5 = (J + 1) - 2
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     J + 5 = J + 1 - 2 \implies J + 5 = J - 1
     \]

7. **Re-evaluate the logical steps:**
   - Correcting the approach, we should directly use the relationship between Amy and Corey to find Jackson’s age.
   - Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey and they share the same age difference relative to James:
     \[
     J + 5 = C - 2
     \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the initial conditions
- Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
- Lee takes 38 seconds.

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's original time
Since Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can set up an equation:
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = 38 + 2 \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation for Gerald's time
\[ \text{Gerald's time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

### Step 4: Apply the improvement due to Gerald's diet
It's stated that Gerald's diet improves his speed by 10%. This means he now runs at 90% of his previous speed.

### Step 5: Calculate Gerald's new time using his improved diet
We know that his current time (without the diet) was 40 seconds. With a 10% improvement, his new time will be:
\[ \text{New time} = \text{Original time} \times (1 - \text{Improvement factor}) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 \times (1 - 0.1) \]
\[ \text{New time} = 40 \times 0.9 \]

### Step 6: Perform the final calculation
\[ \text{New time} = 36 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds** with his improved diet.<|im_end|>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

                    question:
                    , In a neighborhood, the : number of rabbits pets : is twelve less , than . the , combined number : of pet dogs and cats. If ; there . are two : cats ; for : every dog, and the number of dogs is ! 60, how : many , pets in total are in . the , neighborhood?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood based on the given information.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

2. **Given Information:**
   - The number of cats is twice the number of dogs (\( C = 2D \)).
   - The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats (\( R = D + C - 12 \)).

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know that \( D = 60 \).
   - Substitute \( D = 60 \) into \( C = 2D \):
     \[
     C = 2 \times 60 = 120
     \]
   - Now substitute \( D = 60 \) and \( C = 120 \) into the equation for \( R \):
     \[
     R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 178
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Number of Pets:**
   - The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the sum of the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
     \[
     T = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 178
     \]
   - Perform the addition:
     \[
     T = 60 + 120 + 178 = 358
     \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 358.<|im_end|>","If there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, the number of cats is 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120

The number of rabbits pets is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, a total of 180-12 = 168
The total number of pets in the compound is 168+180 = <<168+180=348>>348

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boys:**
   - Total number of students = 200
   - Fraction of boys = \(\frac{2}{5}\)
   
   Number of boys = \(200 \times \frac{2}{5} = 80\)

2. **Calculate the number of girls:**
   - Since all students are either boys or girls, the rest must be girls.
   - Therefore, the fraction of girls = \(1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}\)
   
   Number of girls = \(200 \times \frac{3}{5} = 120\)

3. **Determine how many of the girls are part of the Girl Scout program:**
   - Fraction of girls in the Girl Scout program = \(\frac{2}{3}\)
   
   Number of girls in the Girl Scout program = \(120 \times \frac{2}{3} = 80\)

4. **Calculate the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout program:**
   - Subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout program from the total number of girls.
   
   Number of girls not in the Girl Scout program = \(120 - 80 = 40\)

Therefore, the final answer is: The number of girls who are not in the Girl Scout program is 40.<|im_end|>","There are 200 x 2/5 = <<200*2/5=80>>80 boys in Grade 5.

Out of the 120 girls, 120 x 2/3 = <<120*2/3=80>>80 are in the girl scout.
Therefore, 120 - 80 = <<120-80=40>>40 girls are not in the girl scout.

   - We know that James slept ""only"" \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept.
   - Harry slept 9 hours.

   Let's calculate how much James slept:
   \[
   \text{James' Sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   Simplify:
   \[
   \text{James' Sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the difference in their sleep times:**
   - Harry slept for 9 hours.
   - James slept for 6 hours.

   To find out how many more hours Harry slept compared to James:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total amount of tomatoes used in the sauce:**
   - Freda made 32 ounces of sauce.
   - Canned tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   - Therefore, to get 32 ounces of sauce from canned tomatoes, we need twice as much volume because the tomatoes shrink.

2. **Calculate the total volume of tomatoes needed for the sauce:**
   - Since the tomatoes shrink to half their original volume, we need twice the volume of the sauce.
   - For 32 ounces of sauce, we need \(32 \times 2 = 64\) ounces of tomato volume.

3. **Convert the volume of tomatoes to the number of cans:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - To find out how many cans are needed, divide the total volume of tomatoes required (in ounces) by the volume per can (in ounces).

\[
\text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total volume of tomatoes}}{\text{Volume per can}} = \frac{64}{16} = 4
\]

4. **Calculate the number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, for 4 cans, we need \(4 \times 3 = 12\) tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 12 tomatoes.<|im_end|>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cars**: The initial number of cars on the motorway is 30.

2. **Cars that drive through in the first 15 minutes**:
   - In the first 15 minutes, 5 cars leave the motorway.
   - Therefore, the number of cars that still remain after the first 15 minutes is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

3. **Cars that drive through in the remaining 15 minutes**:
   - After leaving 5 cars initially, 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
   - So, the total number of cars that drive through in both periods is \(5 + 20 = 25\).

4. **Final calculation**: 
   - Initially, there were 30 cars.
   - After driving for 15 minutes (initially), 5 cars left.
   - Then, another 20 cars left.
   - Total cars driven through: \(30 - 5 - 20 = 5\) cars.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of potted plants:**
   - Mary receives 18 new potted plants.
   - She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.

   So, the total initial number of potted plants = (Number of potted plants per ledge * Number of ledges) + Received potted plants
   = (2 * 40) + 18
   = 80 + 18
   = 98 potted plants

2. **Plants given away:**
   - Mary plans to give 1 potted plant to each friend or family member.
   
   Let's denote the number of friends/family members as \( n \).

3. **Final calculation:**
   - After giving away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges, we need to subtract those plants from the total.
   - The number of remaining potted plants after giving away some would be calculated as follows:
     Remaining plants = Total plants - Given away plants
   
   Since Mary gives away one potted plant from each of the 40 ledges,
     Given away plants = 40

Therefore, the number of remaining potted plants = Initial number of potted plants - Given away plants
= 98 - 40
= 58

**The final answer is:** 58 potted plants.<|im_end|>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants

   - Jerome's first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{5}{4} \) times more than the first friend (since \( 20 \times \frac{5}{4} = 25 \)).
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{5}{4} \) times more than the second friend (since \( 25 \times \frac{5}{4} = 37.5 \)).
   - The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

2. **Calculate the total number of doorbell rings made by all four friends combined:**
   - First friend: 20 rings
   - Second friend: 25 rings
   - Third friend: 37.5 rings
   - Fourth friend: 60 rings

Adding these together gives us the total number of doorbell rings:

To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day for the remaining 4 days, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total pages Solo still needs to read.**

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography)
= 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
= 39 pages

So, Solo needs to read **39 pages** in total.

**Step 2: Determine how many pages Solo can read on average per day over the next 4 days.**

Since there are 4 days left, we divide the total number of pages by 4.

Pages per day = Total pages / Number of days
= 39 pages / 4 days
= 9.75 pages/day

Therefore, Solo needs to read **9.75 pages** on average each day for the remaining 4 days.

                    question:
                    A fog bank rolls in from the ocean to cover a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If , the city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank , to cover the whole city?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance that needs to be covered:**
   - The city spans 42 miles from the oceanfront to the inland edge.

2. **Determine the coverage rate per minute:**
   - According to the information given, the fog bank covers 1 mile every 10 minutes.

3. **Convert the coverage rate into an hourly rate:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate the hourly coverage as follows:
     \[
     \text{Coverage rate (miles/hour)} = \frac{\text{Coverage rate (miles/minute)}}{60} = \frac{1}{10} \times \frac{1}{60} = \frac{1}{600}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time required to cover the entire city:**
   - To find out how long it takes to cover the entire 42-mile stretch at this rate, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Distance (miles)}}{\text{Coverage rate (miles/hour)}}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time (hours)} = \frac{42}{\frac{1}{600}} = 42 \times 600 = 25200 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Convert the time back to minutes:**
   - Finally, convert the time from hours to minutes:
     \[
     \text{Time (minutes)} = \text{Time (hours)} \times 60 = 25200 \times 60 = 1512000 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the fog bank will take **1512000** minutes to cover the whole city.<|im_end|>","The city will be covered in 42 / 3 = <<42/3=14>>14 intervals of 10 minutes.

<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Determine how many pieces Poppy initially places on the board.**

Poppy places one-quarter (1/4) of the total pieces on the board.

Total pieces = 1000
Pieces placed by Poppy = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \)

So, after Poppy places her quarter, there are:
\[ 1000 - 250 = 750 \] pieces remaining.

**Step 2: Calculate how many pieces Poppy's mother places on the board.**

Poppy's mother places one-third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.

Remaining pieces = 750
Pieces placed by Poppy's mother = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \)

So, after Poppy's mother places her portion, there are:
\[ 750 - 250 = 500 \] pieces left.

**Step 3: Determine the number of pieces left to be placed in the puzzle.**

After both Poppy and her mother have placed their portions, there are 500 pieces left to be placed in the puzzle.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{500}
\]<|im_end|>","Poppy has placed 1000 pieces / 4 = <<1000/4=250>>250 pieces.
This means there are 1000 – 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 pieces remaining.
Her mom therefore places 750 / 3 = <<750/3=250>>250 pieces.
This leaves a total of 750 – 250 = <<750-250=500>>500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine how many cookies Cody eats.
   - We know that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir does.
   - Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. Calculate the number of cookies Cody eats.
   - Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we multiply Amir's cookie count by 3.
   - \( \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times 5 \)

3. Perform the multiplication to find out how many cookies Cody eats.
   - \( \text{Cody's cookies} = 15 \)

4. Add the number of cookies Cody eats to the number of cookies Amir eats to get the total.
   - \( \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies} \)
   - \( \text{Total cookies} = 5 + 15 \)

5. Calculate the final sum.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the total inner volume of the three boxes after accounting for the wall thickness, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the outer dimensions**:
   - Each box has an outer length (L), width (W), and height (H).
   - Length: \( L = 5 \) inches
   - Width: \( W = 6 \) inches
   - Height: \( H = 4 \) inches

2. **Calculate the outer volume**:
   - Volume of one box = \( L \times W \times H \)
   - Outer volume of one box = \( 5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120 \) cubic inches

3. **Determine the thickness of the walls**:
   - Wall thickness is given as \( 1 \) inch.

4. **Calculate the inner length, width, and height**:
   - Inner length (inner_L) = Outer_length - 2 * Wall_thickness
   - Inner_width (inner_W) = Outer_width - 2 * Wall_thickness
   - Inner_height (inner_H) = Outer_height - 2 * Wall_thickness

   Since the thickness is on both sides, subtract twice the thickness from each dimension.

   - Inner length: \( inner_L = 5 - 2 \times 1 = 3 \) inches
   - Inner width: \( inner_W = 6 - 2 \times 1 = 4 \) inches
   - Inner height: \( inner_H = 4 - 2 \times 1 = 2 \) inches

5. **Calculate the inner volume**:
   - Volume of one box = Inner length × Inner width × Inner height
   - Inner volume of one box = \( 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \) cubic inches

6. **Calculate the total inner volume for all three boxes**:
   - Total inner volume = Inner volume of one box × Number of boxes
   - Total inner volume = \( 24 \times 3 = 72 \) cubic inches

Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is **72 cubic inches**.<|im_end|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches
So in total the inner volume of the 3 boxes is 3*24=<<3*24=72>>72 cubic inches

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break down Frankie's viewing schedule and calculate the number of 30-minute episodes he watched.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Monday and Tuesday**:
   - Frankie watches one 1-hour episode each night.
   - Total time spent watching: \(2 \times 1\) hour = 2 hours.

2. **Wednesday**:
   - Frankie watches a few episodes (let's assume x episodes) and a 30-minute show.
   - Let's denote the total time as \(T\).
   - We know that \(T\) should be less than or equal to 3 hours because there is a 30-minute show included.
   - Let's express the time spent in terms of x:
     \[
     T = x \text{ hours} + \frac{1}{4} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Since \(T \leq 3\), we have:
     \[
     x + \frac{1}{4} \leq 3
     \]
     \[
     x \leq 2.75
     \]

3. **Thursday**:
   - Frankie finishes homework early and watches another 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.
   - Total time spent: \(1 + \frac{1}{2}\) hour = 1.5 hours.

4. **Friday**:
   - Frankie gets to stay up late for the weekend, so he watches two 1-hour episodes.
   - Total time spent: \(2 \times 1\) hour = 2 hours.

### Calculating the Number of 30-Minute Episodes on Wednesday:

Since we don't have the exact number of episodes from Wednesday yet, let's use the information about the total time and the constraints to find out.

From the total time calculation, we need to ensure that the sum of the times for the days matches exactly 7 hours.

Let's summarize what we know:
- Monday and Tuesday: \(2\) hours
- Wednesday: \(x\) hours + \(\frac{1}{4}\) hours
- Thursday: \(1.5\) hours
- Friday: \(2\) hours

We can set up an equation based on the total time:
\[2 + x + \frac{x}{4} + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]

Simplify and solve for \(x\):
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7\]
\[5.5 = 7\]

This doesn't seem right since it implies no time was left over. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

### Re-evaluating the Approach:

Given that the total time must match exactly 7 hours and considering the constraints:
- From Monday and Tuesday: \(2\) hours
- From Thursday: \(1.5\) hours
- From Friday: \(2\) hours

Total time already accounted for:
\[2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5\]

Thus, the remaining time:
\[7 - 5.5 = 1.5\] hours

This confirms that the remaining time is correctly allocated.

Now, focusing on Wednesday:
- Let's denote the number of 30-minute episodes as \(y\).

Since each episode is at least 30 minutes long:
\[y \geq 1\]

But we also need to consider the constraint that \(x + \frac{1}{4} \leq 2.75\).

If \(y = 1\), then:
\[x + \frac{1}{4} = 2.75\]
\[x = 2.75 - \frac{1}{4} = 2.625\]

Since \(x\) must be an integer (as episodes are discrete units), and given that he watched at least one full episode, \(y = 1\) is not possible.

Therefore, if \(y > 1\), the remaining time cannot satisfy the conditions without breaking the constraint on the episodes.

Hence, the only feasible solution is:
\[y = 1\]

So, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is:
\[\boxed{1}\]<|im_end|>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year.

### Step 2: Calculate Actual Cookies Baked
Henry made double the amount he planned:
\[ 2x \]

### Step 3: Adjust for Extra Cookies
He actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended:
\[ 2x + 15 \]

### Step 4: Subtract Dropped Cookies
He dropped 5 cookies before cooling them:
\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

### Step 5: Final Number of Cookies
After dropping some, he had 110 cookies left:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
We need to find \( x \):
\[
2x + 10 = 110 \\
2x = 110 - 10 \\
2x = 100 \\
x = \frac{100}{2} \\
x = 50
\]

### Conclusion
Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]<|im_end|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.

<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the total number of roll-ups for each person.
- Marcell's roll-ups: 
  - Width: 3 roll-ups
  - Length: 14 roll-ups
- Beatrice's roll-ups:
  - Width: 2 roll-ups
  - Length: 24 roll-ups

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roll-ups each has.
- Total roll-ups for Marcell:
  \[
  \text{Total roll-ups} = (\text{Width}) \times (\text{Length}) = (3) \times (14) = 42
  \]
- Total roll-ups for Beatrice:
  \[
  \text{Total roll-ups} = (\text{Width}) \times (\text{Length}) = (2) \times (24) = 48
  \]

### Step 3: Determine whose total number of roll-ups is higher.
- Marcell's total roll-ups: 42
- Beatrice's total roll-ups: 48

Since Beatrice has more roll-ups in total, she will win the contest.

### Step 4: Calculate how many roll-ups each would need to eat to tie or exceed each other.
- To tie at 42 roll-ups:
  \[
  \text{Roll-ups per person} = \frac{\text{Total roll-ups}}{2} = \frac{42}{2} = 21
  \]
- To beat Marcell (who has 42 roll-ups):
  \[
  \text{Roll-ups per person} = 42 + 1 = 43
  \]

### Step 5: Find out which of them needs to eat more roll-ups.
- Beatrice needs to eat 43 roll-ups to tie or beat Marcell.
- Marcell only needs to eat 21 roll-ups to match Beatrice.

### Conclusion:
Beatrice needs to eat 43 roll-ups to tie or beat Marcell, meaning she eats more roll-ups on average compared to Marcell.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is that Beatrice eats more roll-ups on average.}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the rate at which the boat leaks water:**
   - We know that the boat takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet.
   - Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the speed in terms of feet per second.
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
     \]
   
2. **Calculate how many seconds it would take to reach the shore:**
   - The total distance from the starting point to the shore is 64 feet.
   - Using the same speed calculated above (1.25 feet per second), we can determine how long it will take to cover 64 feet.
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{1.25 \text{ feet/second}} = 51.2 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water the boat has leaked by the time Julia reaches the shore:**
   - We know that for every 10 feet rowed, the boat takes on 2 liters of water.
   - At a rowing speed of 1.25 feet per second, the number of 10-foot segments in 64 feet is:
     \[
     \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 6.4 \text{ segments}
     \]
   - For every 10 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water, so for 6.4 segments, it will have taken on:
     \[
     6.4 \times 2 \text{ liters} = 12.8 \text{ liters}
     \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.8 \text{ liters}}
\]<|im_end|>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.
Thus, she had to row 20 * 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 feet back to shore.
In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of Teachers**: There are 4 teachers.
2. **Number of Lessons per Teacher**: Each teacher takes 2 lessons per day.
3. **Total Number of Lessons per Day**: Since there are 4 teachers and each takes 2 lessons, the total number of lessons per day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Now, we need to calculate how many times the whiteboard is cleaned during these lessons.

4. **Cleaning Frequency Per Lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

So, for one lesson:
\[ 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} \]

Since there are 8 lessons per day:
\[ 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} \times 8 \text{ lessons/day} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day} \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day. 

{The final answer is} 24 times.<|im_end|>","In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days
Ryan has been planting flowers for 15 days.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers planted
Ryan plants 2 flowers per day. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of days by the number of flowers planted per day.
\[ \text{Total flowers} = 15 \times 2 \]

### Step 3: Perform the multiplication
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \]
So far, Ryan has planted 30 flowers.

### Step 4: Adjust for non-growing flowers
We know that out of these 30 flowers, 5 do not grow. To find the actual number of flowers grown, subtract the number of non-growing flowers from the total number of flowers planted.
\[ \text{Number of flowers grown} = 30 - 5 \]

### Step 5: Perform the subtraction
\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \]
Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has grown 25 flowers.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The final answer is **25**.<|im_end|>","Ryan plants 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 flowers in total.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold.
Given:
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

### Step 2: Determine the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
We know from the problem statement that Brittany's phone holds 50 times more photographs than Jamal's phone. Therefore:
\[ \text{Photographs on Brittany's phone} = 50 \times \text{Photographs on Jamal's phone} \]
Substituting the value we found for Jamal's phone:
\[ \text{Photographs on Brittany's phone} = 50 \times 1800 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of photographs on Brittany's phone.
\[ \text{Total photographs on Brittany's phone} = 50 \times 1800 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 50 \times 1800 = 90000 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold **90,000 photographs**.

### Step 4: Determine the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
From the problem statement, we know that the maximum number of photographs on Brittany's phone is 90,000. According to the given information, this number represents 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. We have:
\[ 50D = 90000 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( D \).
Divide both sides by 50:
\[ D = \frac{90000}{50} \]

Perform the division:
\[ D = 1800 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks visible in Jamal's photograph at the zoo is **1800**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{1800}}
\]<|im_end|>","Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos, which is 6 times more than Brittany's phone can hold, Brittany's phone can hold `1800/6=<<1800/6=300>>300 photographs.

                    question:
                    Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also ; has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine Sasha's profit from selling the lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total initial cost of the lumber:**
   - Sasha buys ten 2x4x10 boards at $10 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 2x4x10 boards} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100
     \]
   - Sasha buys five 4x4x10 boards at $16 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of 4x4x10 boards} = 5 \times \$16 = \$80
     \]

   Now, add both costs together to find the total initial cost.
   \[
   \text{Total Initial Cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
   \]

2. **Determine the increase in price due to inflation:**
   - The prices went up by 50%.

3. **Calculate the new price per board after the increase:**
   - For the 2x4x10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New Price per 2x4x10 Board} = \$10 + (50\% \times \$10) = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
     \]
   - For the 4x4x10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New Price per 4x4x10 Board} = \$16 + (50\% \times \$16) = \$16 + \$8 = \$24
     \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue if sold at the new prices:**
   - Selling ten 2x4x10 boards at the new price:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from 2x4x10 Boards} = 10 \times \$15 = \$150
     \]
   - Selling five 4x4x10 boards at the new price:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from 4x4x10 Boards} = 5 \times \$24 = \$120
     \]

   Add both revenues to find the total revenue.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \$150 + \$120 = \$270
   \]

5. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total initial cost from the total revenue:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Initial Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$270 - \$180 = \$90
   \]

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes from selling the lumber is $\boxed{90}$.<|im_end|>","She bought the 2 x 4s for $100 because 10 x 10 = 100

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define two variables:
- \( S \) for the number of teaspoons of sugar used.
- \( W \) for the number of cups of water used.

From the given information, we know that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \]

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We also know that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons (since she used a total of 120 teaspoons).

So, we have two equations:
1. \( \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13} \)
2. \( S + W = 120 \)

### Step 3: Solve for One Variable in Terms of the Other
From equation (1), we can express \( S \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13}W \]

### Step 4: Substitute into Equation (2)
Substitute \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \) into equation (2):
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + W = 120 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ \frac{7}{13}W + \frac{13}{13}W = 120 \]
\[ \frac{20}{13}W = 120 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( W \)
Multiply both sides by 13/20 to isolate \( W \):
\[ W = \frac{120 \times 13}{20} \]
\[ W = \frac{1560}{20} \]
\[ W = 78 \]

### Step 6: Find \( S \)
Now that we know \( W = 78 \), substitute back into \( S = \frac{7}{13}W \):
\[ S = \frac{7}{13} \times 78 \]
\[ S = \frac{546}{13} \]
\[ S = 42 \]

### Conclusion
Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}

   \[
   \text{Total pairs of shoes} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Find the total cost of the shoes**: Each pair of shoes costs $60. Therefore, to find the total amount paid for all the shoes, we multiply the total number of pairs by the price per pair.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 60 = 360

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many containers were imported on the second day given the information about the first day's imports.

1. **First Day Imports:**
   - We know there are 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Total Vehicles After Second Day:**
   - On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port becomes 30.

3. **Calculate Number of Containers for Second Day Imports:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
   - Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the total number of vehicles from the second day will be:
     \[
     x \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 5x \text{ vehicles}
     \]
   - According to the problem, the total number of vehicles after the second day should equal 30:
     \[
     5x = 30
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate Adrien's current salary:**
   - Adrien's original salary = $40,000.
   - His salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
   
2. **Determine Lylah's current salary:**
   - Let Lylah's current salary be \( x \).
   - According to the information given, Adrien's salary is 30% higher than Lylah's.
   - Therefore, \( 40,000 = x + 0.3x \) (since 30% increase means multiplying by 1.3).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   40,000 = 1.3x \\
   x = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \\
   x \approx 30,769.23
   \]

So, Lylah's current salary is approximately $30,769.23.

4. **Calculate Adrien's new salary after 4 years:**
   - Adrien's salary increases by 40% in 4 years.
   - Let \( y \) represent Adrien's new salary.
   - Therefore, \( y = 40,000 \times 1.4 \).

5. **Calculate Lylah's new salary after 4 years:**
   - Lylah's salary also increases by 40% in 4 years.
   - Let \( z \) represent Lylah's new salary.
   - Therefore, \( z = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 \).

6. **Sum their salaries:**
   - Total salary both received together = \( y + z \).

Let's perform these calculations:

- Adrien's new salary:
\[
y = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
\]

- Lylah's new salary:
\[
z = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.88
\]

Now, add their salaries together:
\[
Total \, Salary = y + z = 56,000 + 43,076.88 = 99,076.88
\]

Therefore, the total salary that both Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is $99,076.88.<|im_end|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.

                    question:
                    Miguel ! uses 2 pads of paper a week for his drawing. If there are 30 sheets of paper on a pad of paper, how many sheets of paper does he use every month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sheets used per day:**
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets.
   
   Therefore, the total number of sheets used in one week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. **Convert weeks to days:**
   - There are typically 7 days in a week.

   So, the number of sheets used per day is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ sheets/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 8.57 \text{ sheets/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of sheets used per month:**
   - Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month (since this information isn't specified, let's assume an average of about 4 weeks/month).

   The total number of sheets used in one month would be:
   \[
   8.57 \text{ sheets/day} \times 4 \text{ days/month} \approx 34.28 \text{ sheets/month}
   \]

Therefore, Miguel uses approximately \( 34.28 \) sheets of paper every month.<|im_end|>","Miguel uses 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 sheets of paper every week.

                    question:
                    , Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael : brought ? twice the . amount of apples ; and , half ! the number of oranges ! than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many apples Kael brought:**
   - Morisette brought 5 apples.
   - Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of apples Kael brought} = 2 \times (\text{Number of apples Morisette brought})
   \]
   
   Substituting Morisette's apple count:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples Kael brought} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

2. **Determine how many oranges Kael brought:**
   - Morisette brought 8 oranges.
   - Kael brought half as many oranges as Morisette.

   \[
   \text{Number of oranges Kael brought} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Number of oranges Morisette brought})
   \]
   
   Substituting Morisette's orange count:

   \[
   \text{Number of oranges Kael brought} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits each person has:**
   - Morisette's total: 
     \[
     \text{Total fruits Morisette brought} = 5 + 8 = 13
     \]
     
   - Kael's total:
     \[
     \text{Total fruits Kael brought} = 10 + 4 = 14
     \]

4. **Add up all the fruits together:**

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = (\text{Total fruits Morisette}) + (\text{Total fruits Kael})
   \]
   
   Substituting the totals we found:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 13 + 14 = 27
   \]

### Conclusion:
Morisette and Kael together have a total of 27 fruits. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down Sadie's sleeping pattern day by day.

1. **Monday**: She slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday. So, she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday. So, she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. **Thursday**: She slept 1 hour more than Wednesday. So, she slept \(4 + 1 = 5\) hours.
5. **Friday**: She slept 2 hours less than Thursday. So, she slept \(5 - 2 = 3\) hours.
6. **Saturday**: She slept 2 hours less than Friday. So, she slept \(3 - 2 = 1\) hour.
7. **Sunday**: She slept 2 hours less than Saturday. So, she slept \(1 - 2 = -1\) hour (but since it's not possible to sleep negative hours, we assume this should be interpreted as an error or adjustment).

Now let's sum up her total sleep for the week:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 5 hours
- Friday: 3 hours
- Saturday: 1 hour
- Sunday: Assuming corrected or adjusted to 0 hours due to the previous calculation issue.

Total sleep in the week = \(8 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 0\)

Calculating the sum:

\(8 + 6 = 14\)
\(14 + 4 = 18\)
\(18 + 5 = 23\)
\(23 + 3 = 26\)
\(26 + 1 = 27\)
\(27 + 0 = 27\)

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{27}\) hours.<|im_end|>","If on Monday she slept 8 hours, then she slept 8-2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours on each of the next two days.
The total number of hours slept for the two days will be 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.
If she slept 1 hour more for the rest of the week each day, then each day she slept 6+1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours.
The total for the rest of the week will be 4*7 = <<4*7=28>>28 hours.
The total number of hours slept for the whole week will be 8+12+28 = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down the problem into two parts: her initial running phase and her second phase.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie runs during her first phase**

Rosie's speed during her first phase is 10 miles per hour (mph), and she runs for 3 hours. To find the total distance covered during this period, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie covers 30 miles in the first 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Rosie runs during her second phase**

After the first 3 hours, Rosie increases her speed to 5 mph and continues running for the remaining time. The total time available for running is 7 hours, so the remaining time after the first 3 hours is:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

During this last 4-hour period at 5 mph, we calculate the distance using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

**Step 3: Add the distances from both phases together**

Now, we add the distance covered in the first phase to the distance covered in the second phase:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Rosie can run in 7 hours is **50 miles**.<|im_end|>","For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.
However, she still has 7-3=<<7-3=4>>4 hours left to room.
For the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.
In total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of letters needing stamps:**
   - Jennie has a pile of 60 letters.
   - She puts stamps on one-third of these letters.
   - One-third of 60 = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.

2. **Calculate the number of letters already stamped:**
   - There are 30 letters already stamped.
   
3. **Verify if all letters need stamps have been accounted for:**
   - Since she only put stamps on 20 out of 60 letters, we should check if there are any letters left without stamps.
   - 60 - 20 = 40 letters still need stamps.

Given the information provided, we can conclude:

- The number of letters needing stamps initially was 60.
- After putting stamps on one-third (20), 40 more letters still needed stamps remain.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Condition**: Julia was planning on serving stew at her own home.
   
   - Julia noticed she was out of plastic spoons.
   - She decided to buy a new package of spoons.

2. **Additional Spoons**:
   
   - Her husband bought another package of 5 new spoons and gave it to Julia.
   
3. **Spoons Used and Remaining**:
   
   - Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew while cooking.
   - When setting up the table later, she found a total of 12 spoons.

4. **Finding the Number of Spoons Bought Initially**:
   
   Let's denote the number of spoons Julia initially bought as \( x \).

   - After using 3 spoons for tasting, she has \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) spoons left.
   - Since she originally had \( x \) spoons plus the 5 additional spoons from her husband, we can write: 
     \[
     x + 5 = 9
     \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 9 - 5 = 4
   \]

So, Julia initially bought 4 packages of spoons before buying more spoons from her husband.

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought initially is **4**.<|im_end|>","The total number of spoons from Julia and her husband was 12+3=<<12+3=15>>15 spoons.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the quantities given:**
   - Dylan needs chicken sausages.
   - Dylan needs fish.
   - Dylan buys 38 chicken sausages.
   - Dylan buys 6 more fish.

2. **Determine how many chicken sausages Dylan has in total:**
   - Since he needs chicken sausages but only bought 38, his need for chicken sausages equals his purchase.
   
3. **Calculate the number of sausages Dylan has in total:**
   - We know that he also bought 6 more fish, which we can assume he used some of these fish to make sausage buns (as stated).
   
4. **Assess what happens next:**
   - After making sausage buns from the sausages, he still needs chicken sausages. 

5. **Calculate how many sausages he needs after buying the sausages:**
   - Let's denote the number of sausages he needs as \( S \).

6. **Set up an equation based on the information provided:**
   - We know he bought 38 chicken sausages initially.
   - He then makes sausage buns using some of these chicken sausages, plus 6 more fish, and still needs more chicken sausages.

7. **Solve for the total number of sausages:**
   - From the above steps, we understand that he needs chicken sausages beyond those he already had.
   - If he made sausage buns with some chicken sausages, he must have started with more than just the 38 he bought.
   - The remaining chicken sausages he still needs after making sausage buns would be less than or equal to the initial 38 he bought.

8. **Final calculation:**
   - Given he bought 38 chicken sausages and still needs more, we calculate the total number of sausages he needs.
   - This means he buys additional sausages to meet his need.
   - Therefore, the total number of sausages he buys is greater than 38.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Dylan buys more sausages than he originally intended, likely aiming to balance out the need for both chicken sausages and fish.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: Dylan bought a total of 38 chicken sausages + [additional chicken sausages needed] = 44 chicken sausages in total.<|im_end|>","He bought 38 + 6 = <<38+6=44>>44 fish sausages.

   - According to the information provided, Lily made 50 friends.

2. **Determine the number of friends Amy has based on the given relationship:**
   - The problem states that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily.
   - Since Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20
     \]
     Substituting the value for Lily's friends:
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the price of a watermelon
Given that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, we can set up an equation based on this information.

Let \( W \) represent the cost of one watermelon.
Then, the cost of one orange would be \( W - 5 \).

Since the cost of a watermelon is three times that of a pepper, and knowing that one pepper costs $15 (as given), we have:
\[ W = 3 \times 15 \]
\[ W = 45 \]

So, the cost of one watermelon is $45.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for each item
Now that we know the cost of one watermelon ($45), we can calculate the total cost for each item Dillon needs to purchase:
- Watermelons: 4 watermelons × $45 per watermelon = $180
- Peppers: 20 peppers × $15 per pepper = $300
- Oranges: 10 oranges × $[W] per orange

Since we already determined that \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value in:
- Oranges: 10 oranges × $45 per orange = $450

### Step 3: Sum up all the costs
Finally, we add up the costs of all items to find the total amount Dillon will spend:
\[ Total\ Cost = $180 + $300 + $450 \]
\[ Total\ Cost = $930 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is $930.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $930.<|im_end|>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

He also purchases peppers at a total price of 20 * 15 = $<<20*15=300>>300.
The oranges cost him a total of 10 * 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.

To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to consider both revenue and costs associated with the services provided. Let's break this down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Visits per Day
- There are 500 people visiting the hospital each day.

### Step 2: Calculate Average Time Spent on Visits
- Each visit takes 24 minutes.
- Convert 24 minutes to hours (since the rates are given in hourly rates):
  \[
  24 \text{ minutes} = \frac{24}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Revenue from Visits
- Revenue is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Average Time Per Visit} \times \text{Rate Charged Per Hour}
  \]
- Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = 500 \times 0.4 \times 150 = 300,000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Costs
- **Doctor's Fees**: 
  - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
  - They see 500 patients per day, so their total time spent seeing patients is:
    \[
    500 \times 0.4 \text{ hours/day} = 200 \text{ hours/year}
    \]
  - Therefore, they earn:
    \[
    \text{Annual Earnings from Doctor's Fees} = 200 \text{ hours/year} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year}
    \]
- **Patient Charges**:
  - Patients pay $200 per hour.
  - They spend 0.4 hours per visit, so the total chargeable time per visit is:
    \[
    0.4 \text{ hours/visit} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 80 \text{ dollars/visit}
    \]
  - For 500 patients per day, the total chargeable time is:
    \[
    500 \text{ visits/day} \times 80 \text{ dollars/visit} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day}
    \]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Cost
- Annual cost calculation:
  - **Doctor's Fees**:
    \[
    \text{Annual Cost from Doctor's Fees} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year}
    \]
  - **Patient Charges**:
    \[
    \text{Annual Cost from Patient Charges} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day} \times 365 \text{ days/year} = 14,600,000 \text{ dollars/year}
    \]
  - **Total Annual Cost**:
    \[
    \text{Total Annual Cost} = 30,000 + 14,600,000 = 14,630,000 \text{ dollars/year}
    \]

### Step 6: Calculate Profit
- Profit is calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
  \]
- Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = 300,000 - 14,630,000 = -14,330,000 \text{ dollars/year}
  \]

### Conclusion
The hospital incurs a significant loss of approximately $14,330,000 annually due to its operations. This indicates that the hospital might need to increase its revenues or reduce its costs significantly to achieve profitability.<|im_end|>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day
That means they see patients for 12000/60=<<12000/60=200>>200 hours a day
They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

<|im_start|>waitress
To determine how many elves are left, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial number of elves**: 60
2. **Elves who quit after being sickened**: 30 (since 60 * 50% = 30)
   - This means that initially 60 elves were hired.

3. **Remaining elves after first round of quitting**: 
   - Initial total - Elves who quit after sickness = 60 - 30 = 30 elves left.

4. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 (since 30 * 33.33% ≈ 10)
   - This indicates that out of the remaining 30 elves, 10 quit because of getting their shins kicked.

5. **Final number of elves**:
   - Remaining elves from the previous round minus those who quit = 30 - 10 = 20 elves left.

Therefore, the final number of elves left is 20. 

{The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.
Then subtract that number from the starting number of elves to find out how many are left: 60 elves - 20 elves = <<60-20=40>>40 elves.
Then subtract the number of elves who quit after being kicked to find the total number who left: 40 elves - 10 elves = <<40-10=30>>30 elves.

To determine Joseph's total expenditure over May and June, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given data:**
   - Joseph's expenditure in May = $500.
   - Joseph's expenditure in June = $500 - $60 (since it was $60 less than in May).

2. **Calculate Joseph's expenditure in June:**
   \[
   \text{Expenditure in June} = \$500 - \$60 = \$440
   \]

3. **Sum up the expenditures from both months:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenditure} = \$500 (\text{May}) + \$440 (\text{June})

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step by step:

1. **Pam's rides**:
   - Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
   - Each ride costs 6 tickets.

   Calculation for Pam:
   \[
   \text{Tickets used by Pam} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

2. **Fred's rides**:
   - Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times.
   - Each ride costs 6 tickets.

   Calculation for Fred:
   \[
   \text{Tickets used by Fred} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Luge rides**:
   - Both Pam and Fred decide to ride the luge 2 times each.

   Since there is no mention of any additional rides other than what's already calculated (roller coasters), we don't need to consider anything else for the luges.

Now, let's add up all the tickets used:

- Tickets used by Pam: 12
- Tickets used by Fred: 24

Total tickets used:
\[
12 + 24 = 36
\]

So, the total number of tickets they used on that day is 36. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday
- Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday.

\[ \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles walked on Monday} \]

Substitute the given value for Monday’s miles:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance walked from Monday to Tuesday
- Total distance from Monday to Tuesday is the sum of the distances walked on both days.

\[ \text{Total distance from Monday to Tuesday} = \text{Miles walked on Monday} + \text{Miles walked on Tuesday} \]

Substitute the values calculated above:

\[ \text{Total distance from Monday to Tuesday} = 4 + 24 = 28 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of miles Walt walked on Wednesday
- The total distance from Monday to Wednesday is given as 41 miles.

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = \text{Total distance from Monday to Wednesday} - \text{Total distance from Monday to Tuesday} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \text{Miles walked on Wednesday} = 41 - 28 = 13 \]

To determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate monthly cost:**
   - Tom gets 0.4 car washes per month.
   - Each car wash costs $15.

2. **Determine total number of car washes per month:**
   \[
   \text{Total car washes per month} = 0.4 \times 15 = 6 \text{ car washes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost per month:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per month} = 6 \times 15 = \$90
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for a year (12 months):**

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. First, we need to determine how many video games Bobby initially had.
   - We know that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.
   - Brian originally had 20 video games.

2. Calculate three times the number of Brian's video games:
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. Subtract 5 from this result to find out how many more video games Bobby has compared to what he would normally have:
   \[
   60 - 5 = 55
   \]

4. This means Bobby currently has 55 video games.

Therefore, Bobby has 55 video games.

{The final answer is} 55.<|im_end|>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of unicorns:**
   - We know that there are 27 unicorns in the world.

2. **Calculate the number of unicorns in Scotland:**
   - According to the information given, one-third of all unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.
   - Therefore, the number of unicorns in Scotland = (1/3) * Total unicorns
     \[
     \text{Number of unicorns in Scotland} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
     \]

3. **Find out how many of these unicorns are male:**
   - Since two-thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female, we can find the number of males by subtracting the females from the total.
   - The number of males = (2/3) * Number of unicorns in Scotland
     \[
     \text{Number of males} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of female unicorns in Scotland:**
   - Finally, since two-thirds of the unicorns are female, we calculate the number of females as follows:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discounts or fees.
First, let's calculate the cost of the items Rory ordered.

- Subs: 2 subs * $7.50 each = $15.00
- Bags of chips: 2 bags * $1.50 each = $3.00
- Cookies: 2 cookies * $1.00 each = $2.00

Now, sum up all these costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

### Step 2: Apply the delivery fee.
There is a 20% delivery fee on top of the total order cost. Let's calculate this.

- Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00
\[ \text{Delivery fee} = 0.20 \times 20.00 = \$4.00 \]

### Step 3: Add the tip.
Rory wants to add a $5.00 tip.

- Total cost after adding the delivery fee and tip:
\[ \text{Final cost} = (\$20.00 + \$4.00) + \$5.00 \]
\[ \text{Final cost} = \$28.00 + \$5.00 \]
\[ \text{Final cost} = \$33.00 \]

To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of questions in both tests**

- First test: 75 questions
- Second test: 100 questions

Total number of questions = 75 + 100 = 175 questions

**Step 2: Determine the time taken for each test**

- Time taken for the first test: 8 hours
- Time taken for the second test: 6 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the number of questions Mark can complete in each given time period**

- Rate of completing questions: 5 questions per hour

First Test (Time: 8 hours):
\[ \text{Number of questions} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Number of questions} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Second Test (Time: 6 hours):
\[ \text{Number of questions} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Number of questions} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

**Step 4: Sum up the number of questions completed in both tests**

\[ \text{Total questions completed} = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

**Step 5: Subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions**

\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = \text{Total questions} - \text{Total questions completed} \]
\[ \text{Questions left incomplete} = 175 - 70 = 105 \]

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we have:
\[ B = 12 \]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
According to the problem statement, there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs compared to the number of blue gumballs. This can be written as:
\[ P + 22 = 4B \]

### Step 3: Substitute the Known Value
Substitute \( B = 12 \) into the equation:
\[ P + 22 = 4(12) \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Calculate \( 4 \times 12 \):
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
So, our equation now becomes:
\[ P + 22 = 48 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( P \)
Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 48 - 22 \]
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of pink gumballs is **26**.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 26 pink gumballs.<|im_end|>","Four times the number of blue gumballs is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 gumballs

                    Of the ! 20 available cars , for ? rent, 12 are . automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and : the rest ; are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of semi-automatic cars**:
   - Total number of cars: 20
   - Number of automatic cars: 12
   - Number of manual cars: 4
   
   Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
                          = 20 - 12 - 4
                          = 20 - 16
                          = 4

2. **Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars**:
   - Percentage calculation formula: (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) * 100
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100
     \]
   
3. **Simplify the fraction**:
   - Simplify \(\frac{4}{20}\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5}
     \]

4. **Convert the simplified fraction to a percentage**:
   - Multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:
     \[
     \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Identify the total number of bees**: We know that there are 700 bees in total.

2. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

3. **Establish relationships between quantities**:
   - According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \).
   - Also, there are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \).

4. **Express everything in terms of one variable**:
   - From \( B = 2Q \), we can express \( Q \) in terms of \( B \): \( Q = \frac{B}{2} \).
   - Substitute \( Q \) back into the equation for \( B \): \( B = 2 \times \frac{B}{2} = B \). This confirms our relationship holds true.

5. **Substitute \( Q \) and \( B \) into the total bee count**:
   - Since \( Q = \frac{B}{2} \), substitute \( Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
     \[
     W = 2B
     \]
   - Now, substitute \( B \) into the total bee count equation:
     \[
     W + B + Q = 700
     \]

6. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - Substitute \( Q = \frac{B}{2} \) into the total bee count equation:
     \[
     W + B + \frac{B}{2} = 700
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     W + \frac{3B}{2} = 700
     \]
   - Multiply every term by 2 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2W + 3B = 1400
     \]
   - Substitute \( W = 2B \) into the equation:
     \[
     4B + 3B = 1400
     \]
     \[
     7B = 1400
     \]
     \[
     B = \frac{1400}{7}
     \]
     \[
     B = 200
     \]

7. **Find the number of worker bees**:
   - Given \( W = 2B \):
     \[
     W = 2 \times 200
     \]
     \[
     W = 400
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The number of worker bees is 400}.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of queens

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many hours Jordan spends on video games in one week.
2. Determine how much Jordan would earn from his part-time job in that same period.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games in one week.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

So, Jordan spends 14 hours playing video games in one week.

Next, let's move to the second step:

Step 2: Determine how much Jordan would earn from his part-time job.

Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job. To find out how much he would earn in one week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly wage:

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \]

Therefore, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items before taxes and then apply the 10% tax if applicable.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Non-food Items:**
   - Milk (for $2)
   - Eggs (for $3)
   - Light Bulbs (for $3)
   - Cups (for $3)

2. **Calculate Total Cost Before Tax:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$2 + \$3 + \$3 + \$3 = \$11
   \]

3. **Apply 10% Tax:**
   - Since all items except milk, eggs, light bulbs, and cups are considered non-food items, they will have a 10% tax applied to them.
   - The tax amount per item can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Tax per item} = \left(\frac{\$1}{\text{number of items}}\right) \times 10\%
     \]
   - For milk, eggs, light bulbs, and cups:
     \[
     \text{Tax per item} = \left(\frac{\$1}{4}\right) \times 10\% = \$0.25
     \]
   - Calculate the total tax for all non-food items:
     \[
     \text{Total tax} = 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1
     \]

4. **Add the Taxed Amount to Original Cost:**
   \[
   \text{Final cost} = \$11 + \$1 = \$12

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waiter
To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Income:**
   - Kim currently has 3 clients.
   - He talks to 5 more potential clients.
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of clothes.

Let's determine the total number of items needed per client:
- Bleach: 2 bottles × 3 clients = 6 bottles
- Clothes: 1 pack × 5 clients = 5 packs

Total items needed per client = 6 bottles + 5 packs = 11 items per client.

Since he has multiple clients, let's assume he can serve all 8 clients (3 current + 5 potential).

Now, calculate the total number of items needed for all clients:
- Total items = 11 items/client × 8 clients = 88 items.

Next, calculate the cost based on the number of items needed:
- Cost of bleach: \( 88 \text{ items} \times \$2/\text{item} = \$176 \)
- Cost of clothes: \( 88 \text{ items} \times \$5/\text{item} = \$440 \)

Total expenses = Cost of bleach + Cost of clothes = \$176 + \$440 = \$616.

2. **Calculate Total Income:**
   - Kim's total income per week is given as \$92.

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses = \$92 - \$616 = -\$524.

Therefore, Kim will incur a loss of \$524 each week due to his expenses.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** 
\[
\boxed{-524}

The bottles of bleach will cost him 16 bottles of bleach * $2 per bottle of bleach = $<<16*2=32>>32.
The packs of cloths will cost him 8 packs of cloths * $5 per pack of cloths = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So each week, Lucas' total expenses will be $32 for bleach + $40 for packs of cloths = $<<32+40=72>>72.
His profit will therefore be $92 total income - $72 total expenses = $<<92-72=20>>20.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pineapples in the entire field.
2. Determine how often John can harvest his pineapples.
3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested over one year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples in the field**

John's field size is 10 hectares, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare.

\[ \text{Total pineapples} = \text{Field size (hectares)} \times \text{Pineapples per hectare} \]

\[
= 10 \, \text{hectares} \times 100 \, \text{pineapples/hectare}
\]

\[
= 1000 \, \text{pineapples}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how often John can harvest his pineapples**

John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested over one year**

There are 12 months in a year.

John can harvest his pineapples once every 3 months. So, he can do this:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of months in a year}}{\text{Months between harvests}}
\]

\[
= \frac{12}{3}
\]

\[
= 4 \, \text{harvests/year}
\]

Now, multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of harvests per year:

\[
\text{Total pineapples harvested in a year} = \text{Total pineapples} \times \text{Harvests per year}
\]

\[
= 1000 \, \text{pineapples} \times 4
\]

\[
= 4000 \, \text{pineapples}
\]

Therefore, John can harvest **4000** pineapples within a year.<|im_end|>","John has 100 x 10= <<100*10=1000>>1000 pineapples on his field.

2. The second box contains 3 times as many pieces as the first box: \( 500 \times 3 = 1500 \) pieces.
3. The third box contains 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box: \( 500 / 4 = 125 \) pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

                    question:
                    Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that initially leave the hive.**
Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

**Step 2: Determine the number of bees that return after leaving.**
She sees half that many bees return in the next 6 hours. Since 30 bees leave, half of them would be:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]
So, 15 bees return back to the hive.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of bees that leave the hive over the entire period.**
We know that 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours and then another 15 bees leave in the next 6 hours (since they return half of what leaves). So, the total number of bees that leave is:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of bees that return to the hive.**
Debra sees twice as many bees returning compared to those that left. Therefore, if \( x \) bees leave, \( 2x \) bees return. We don't have the exact number of bees that leave again, but we can use the information given about the initial numbers.
Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of bees that return for the second time, we assume the same pattern continues, meaning the same ratio applies. However, since the problem states ""two times as many bees as she saw first,"" it implies the same number of bees return as initially seen (30), which means no additional bees return beyond the initial count.

Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive is the same as the number that initially left, which is 30.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.

In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

Brittany's mom ; gives ! the cashier money for 1 child ticket and ; 1 adult : ticket. If she : received $8 ; in change, how much , money, in ; dollars, did she give the : cashier?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total amount paid:**
   - Brittany's mom gave the cashier $40 (as given in change).

2. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts or changes:**
   - The total cost should equal the amount given minus the change.
   - Total cost = $40.

3. **Determine the number of tickets bought:**
   - Brittany's mom bought one child ticket and one adult ticket.

4. **Calculate the cost per type of ticket:**
   - Adult ticket costs $12.
   - Child ticket costs $10.

5. **Set up an equation based on the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of adult tickets} \times \text{Adult ticket price}) + (\text{Number of child tickets} \times \text{Child ticket price})
   \]
   Let \( x \) be the number of adult tickets and \( y \) be the number of child tickets.
   So,
   \[
   12x + 10y = 40
   \]

6. **Solve for the possible combinations of tickets that satisfy the above equation:**
   - Since we know there was only one adult ticket purchased, \( x = 1 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     12(1) + 10y = 40
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     12 + 10y = 40
     \]
     Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     10y = 28
     \]
     Divide by 10:
     \[
     y = 2.8
     \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Number of adult tickets = 1.
   - Number of child tickets = 2.8 (not possible as you can't buy a fraction of a ticket).
   
Since we cannot have a fractional number of tickets, re-evaluate the constraints. Given that she gave $40 in total and received $8 back, the correct interpretation would be to consider whole numbers of tickets.

Given the original problem statement, if we assume whole tickets were bought, then:
- She must have bought either 1 adult ticket and no child tickets or 0 adult tickets and 2 child tickets, but since 2.8 is not feasible, let's reconsider the initial assumption about tickets being bought.

Revisiting the calculation, if she bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, the cost would be:
- Cost of 1 adult ticket = $12
- Cost of 1 child ticket = $10
- Total cost = $12 + $10 = $22
- Change received = $40 - $22 = $18 (which does not match the given information)

Therefore, she must have bought 1 adult ticket and 1 child ticket, but the change scenario doesn't fit with whole numbers.

Thus, the correct approach is to directly calculate the change given as part of the total amount paid minus the change received:
\[
\text{Amount paid} = 40
\]
\[
\text{Change received} = 8
\]
\[
\text{Amount given} = 40 - 8 = 32
\]

So, the final answer is: \boxed{32}<|im_end|>","The total cost of the tickets is 12+10=<<12+10=22>>22 dollars.
Brittany's mom gave the cashier 22+8=<<22+8=30>>30 dollars.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
Given that Charlie has 12 Facebook friends and he has three times as many friends as Dorothy, we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has.

Let \( D \) represent the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.

We know:
\[ 3D = 12 \]

Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ D = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of Facebook friends James has.
James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. Therefore, if Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, then James would have:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of Facebook friends James has is **16**.<|im_end|>","Dorothy has 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 Facebook friends.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine who wins the race and for how long, we need to calculate the time it takes each person to reach home.

1. **Calculate the time it takes Steve to reach home:**
   - Distance = 3 miles
   - Speed = 440 feet per minute
   - Convert miles to feet (since 1 mile = 5280 feet)
     \[
     \text{Distance in feet} = 3 \times 5280 = 15720 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
     \[
     \text{Time taken by Steve} = \frac{15720}{440} \approx 36 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes Tim to reach home:**
   - Distance = 2 miles
   - Speed = 264 feet per minute
   - Convert miles to feet (same conversion as above)
     \[
     \text{Distance in feet} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
     \[
     \text{Time taken by Tim} = \frac{10560}{264} \approx 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

**Conclusion:** 
- The winner is Tim because he reaches home faster.
- The loser is Steve because he took longer to complete the race.
- The winner will finish first, so they won't have to wait for the loser.
  
Therefore, the final answer is: Tim.<|im_end|>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.
It will take Steve 15840 feet / (440 feet/minute) = <<15840/(440)=36>>36 minutes to get home.
Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.
Steve will finish the race in 40 minutes - 36 minutes = <<40-36=4>>4 minutes less time than Tim.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost for inflating one bicycle tire:**
   - Cost per tire = $0.25

2. **Calculate the total number of tires inflated in the first scenario (bicycles):**
   - Number of cyclists who got both tires inflated = 5
   - Total tires inflated = 5 * 2 = 10 tires

3. **Calculate the total cost for these bicycles:**
   - Total cost for bicycles = 10 tires * $0.25/tire = $2.50

4. **Calculate the total number of tires inflated in the second scenario (tricycles):**
   - Number of tricyclists who got all tires inflated = 3
   - Total tires inflated = 3 * 3 = 9 tires

5. **Calculate the total cost for these tricycles:**
   - Total cost for tricycles = 9 tires * $0.25/tire = $2.25

6. **Calculate the total number of tires inflated in the third scenario (unicycles):**
   - Number of unicyclists who got one tire inflated = 1
   - Total tires inflated = 1 * 1 = 1 tire

7. **Calculate the total cost for these unicycles:**
   - Total cost for unicycles = 1 tire * $0.25/tire = $0.25

8. **Sum up the total costs from all scenarios:**
   - Total cost = Cost for bicycles + Cost for tricycles + Cost for unicycles
     = $2.50 + $2.25 + $0.25 = $5.00

Therefore, the amount Shawnda made that day is **$5.00**.<|im_end|>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.

- Carl buys ten packs of cookies.
- Each pack contains six cookies.
  
\[ \text{Total number of cookies} = 10 \times 6 \]

\[

\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of all the cookies**
- Each cookie costs $0.10.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 60 \times 0.10 \]

\[

**Step 3: Calculate how much money Carl pays initially**
- Carl uses a $10 bill.

\[ \text{Money paid} = \$10 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl pays**

\[ \text{Change received} = \$10 - \$6 \]

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Dave buys a pack of 14 French Fries.

2. **Seagull Theft**: The seagull steals half the amount of French Fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 French Fries, the seagull takes \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) French Fries.

3. **Pigeon Bullying**: Three pigeons bully Dave away from the remaining French Fries. Each pigeon eats 3 French Fries. Therefore, the total eaten by the pigeons is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

4. **Raccoon Theft**: A raccoon steals two-thirds of the remaining French Fries. After the seagull took its share, there are \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) French Fries left. So, the raccoon steals \( \frac{2}{3} \times 7 = \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \), but since we can't have a fraction of a French Fry, let's round up to 5 (because even if it's not an exact whole number, it still counts as one more for practical purposes).

   Now, after the raccoon takes its share, there are approximately \( 7 - 5 = 2 \) French Fries left.

5. **Ants Carrying Off**: Finally, ants carry off a single French Fry, leaving only 1 French Fry behind.

So, at the end, there was exactly 1 French Fry in the pack when Dave bought it.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 1.<|im_end|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.

The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate his total class time for each type of day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and then sum these values.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Class Schedule:**
   - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: 3 classes per day for 1 hour each.
   - Tuesday and Thursday: 2 classes per day for 2 hours each.

2. **Calculate Class Time for Each Type of Day:**

   - **Mon, Wed, Fri (MWF):**
     - Number of days = 3
     - Classes per day = 3
     - Total classes per week = \(3 \times 3 = 9\) classes
     - Time spent on MWF = \(9 \times 1 = 9\) hours per week
     - Weeks in semester = 16
     - Total class time for MWF = \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours

   - **Tues, Thurs (TW):**
     - Number of days = 2
     - Classes per day = 2
     - Total classes per week = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) classes
     - Time spent on TW = \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours per week
     - Weeks in semester = 16
     - Total class time for TW = \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours

3. **Sum the Total Class Time for One Semester:**
   - Total class time = \(144 + 128 = 272\) hours

Therefore, Kimo spends a total of **272** hours attending classes in one semester.<|im_end|>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of the rolls.
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.

\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the croissants.
- Bill bakes 120 croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.

\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total length of the baguettes.
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

First, convert the length from feet to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches):

\[
2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, calculate the total length of the baguettes:

\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Sum up the total lengths.
Add the lengths of all the items together:

\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 \text{ inches (rolls)} + 720 \text{ inches (croissants)} + 1440 \text{ inches (baguettes)}
\]

\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the total length back to feet.
Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

\[
\text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

### Final Answer:
Bill's baked goods will be 280 feet long when stacked end-to-end. {The final answer is} 280 feet.<|im_end|>","First find the total length of the rolls: 300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = <<300*4=1200>>1200 inches

Then add the length of the rolls and croissants to find the total length in inches: 1200 inches + 720 inches = <<1200+720=1920>>1920 inches
Then divide the total length by 12 inches per foot to find the length in feet: 1920 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1920/12=160>>160 feet
Then find the total length of the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet/baguette = <<60*2=120>>120 feet

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bananas needed for one month.
\[ \text{Total bananas per month} = (M \times 200) + (G \times 400) + (B \times 100) \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of bananas needed for two months.
\[ \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 2 \times \left( (M \times 200) + (G \times 400) + (B \times 100) \right) \]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression.
Since the numbers of monkeys, gorillas, and baboons do not change over time, let's denote them as follows:
\[ M = x \]
\[ G = y \]
\[ B = z \]

So,
\[ \text{Total bananas per month} = (x \times 200) + (y \times 400) + (z \times 100) \]

And thus,
\[ \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 2 \times ((x \times 200) + (y \times 400) + (z \times 100)) \]

### Step 6: Substitute values into the equation.
Given that the zookeeper orders bananas from a local farm every 2 months, we can substitute the given numbers into the equation. Let's assume the zookeeper orders 1000 bananas every 2 months for simplicity.

For example, if there were 5 monkeys, 3 gorillas, and 2 baboons:
\[ \text{Total bananas per month} = (5 \times 200) + (3 \times 400) + (2 \times 100) = 1000 + 1200 + 200 = 2400 \]
\[ \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 2 \times 2400 = 4800 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the zookeeper would need to order **4800** bananas to last 2 months.

\boxed{4800}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how far the winner runs compared to the loser, we need to calculate the distance each person runs and compare those distances.

### Step 1: Calculate Distance Run by Blake
- **Distance per round trip**: 20 yards (since the field is 100 yards long).
- **Number of trips**: 15 times.
- **Total distance for one way**: \( 20 \text{ yards} \times 15 = 300 \text{ yards} \).

So, Blake runs a total of 300 yards.

### Step 2: Calculate Distance Run by Kelly
- **Distance per trip**: 20 yards (since the field is 100 yards long).
- **Number of trips**: 34 times.
- **Total distance for one way**: \( 20 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 680 \text{ yards} \).

However, Kelly only runs from her starting point at the 40-yard line up to the 100-yard mark and back, effectively covering half the length of the field twice. 

- **Total distance for one way**: \( 100 \text{ yards} \times 2 = 200 \text{ yards} \).

Since Kelly covers this distance 34 times, but only moves along the same straight line path, her effective coverage is just over the field's length:

\[ 200 \text{ yards} \times 34 = 6800 \text{ yards} \]

### Conclusion
Blake runs 300 yards, while Kelly runs approximately 700 yards (6800 yards).

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs more than the loser (Kelly). The difference is:

\[ 7000 \text{ yards} - 300 \text{ yards} = 6700 \text{ yards} \]

**Final Answer:** The winner runs 6700 yards more than the loser.<|im_end|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720

**Step 3: Add the cost of the pencil box (bond paper)**
- The pencil box costs $20.

\[

**Step 4: Sum up all the costs**

\[
\text{Total spent} = \$6 (\text{pens}) + \$8 (\text{notebooks}) + \$20 (\text{pencil box})

   - The depth of the water on Monday is given as 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fish Anakin and Locsin were able to catch based on their individual catches and the conditions given.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Anakin's Catch:**
   - Starfish: 10
   - Sea Horses: 6
   - Clownfish: Let \( C \) be the number of clownfish.
   - Total for Anakin = Starfish + Sea Horses + Clownfish = 10 + 6 + \( C \)

2. **Locsin's Catch:**
   - Starfish: Given that Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin.
     \[
     \text{Starfish} = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]
   - Sea Horses: Given that Locsin caught 3 fewer sea hores than Anakin.
     \[
     \text{Sea Horses} = 6 - 3 = 3
     \]
   - Clownfish: Given that Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin.
     \[
     \text{Clownfish} = C + 2
     \]
   - Total for Locsin = Starfish + Sea Horses + Clownfish = 5 + 3 + (C + 2)
     \[
     \text{Total for Locsin} = 10 + C
     \]

3. **Combine Both Totals:**
   - The total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin must equal the sum of all the individual catches because they were able to catch everything together.
     \[
     \text{Total fish} = 10 + 6 + C + 5 + 3 + (C + 2)
     \]
     Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Total fish} = 24 + 2C
     \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin were able to catch is \(\boxed{24 + 2C}\). Since \(C\) represents the number of clownfish, it cannot be determined without additional information about Locsin's clownfish count. If we assume \(C\) should be an integer value that fits within reasonable constraints, then \(C = 8\), giving us the final answer as 24.<|im_end|>","Locsin caught 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 starfishes.
They caught 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 starfishes.

They caught 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 seahorses
Locsin caught 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 clownfish.
So, they caught 3 + 5 = <<3+5=8>>8 clownfish.
Therefore, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 15 + 9 + 8 = <<15+9+8=32>>32 fish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial cost per bag of marbles:**
   - The initial cost is given as $20.

2. **Calculate the increase in price for each interval (every two months):**
   - The price increases by 20% of the current price.
   
3. **Compute the total number of intervals over 36 months:**
   - Since there are 36 months and each interval is two months long, the number of intervals is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).

4. **Apply the price increase formula iteratively for each interval:**
   - Let's denote the initial price as \( P_0 = \$20 \).
   - After one interval, the new price will be \( P_1 = P_0 + 0.20 \times P_0 \).
   - After two intervals, the new price will be \( P_2 = P_1 + 0.20 \times P_1 \), and so on.

5. **Sum up all the increased prices for the 18 intervals:**
   - We can use the formula for compound interest or geometric series to find the total amount after 18 intervals.

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Cost
- The initial cost is \( P_0 = \$20 \).

### Step 2: Increase Formula
- Each time the price increases, it becomes \( P_{n+1} = P_n \times (1 + r) \), where \( r \) is the rate of increase (20%, or 0.20).

### Step 3: Number of Intervals
- There are 18 intervals (since 36 months divided by 2 months per interval equals 18).

### Step 4 & 5: Iterative Calculation
- Let's compute the price after each interval using the iterative formula until the final price after 18 intervals.

Starting from \( P_0 = \$20 \):

- After 1st interval: 
  \[
  P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + 0.20) = 20 \times 1.20 = \$24
  \]

- After 2nd interval:
  \[
  P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + 0.20) = 24 \times 1.20 = \$28.80
  \]

- Continue this process until the 18th interval:
  
  - After 3rd interval:
    \[
    P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + 0.20) = 28.80 \times 1.20 = \$34.56
    \]
  
  - And so on...

We can see that each subsequent price is multiplied by 1.20, which means the cost keeps increasing exponentially.

### Final Answer:
After applying the price increase formula iteratively for 18 intervals, the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $79.20.<|im_end|>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4
If the price increases after every two months, in 36 months, it will increase 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 times.
If each increase is $4, the total amount the price of the bag of marbles will have increased by after 36 months is 18*$4 = $<<18*4=72>>72

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the value of one red car**: 
   - We know that one red car costs $4.

2. **Determine the combined value of one red car and one action figure**:
   - Since one red car equals three action figures, we can say that one red car = $4.
   - Therefore, one action figure = $\frac{4}{3}$ dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of five red cars**:
   - Five red cars would be worth $4 × 5 = $20.

4. **Determine the value of one doll**:
   - One doll costs as much as three action figures.
   - So, one doll = $5 × 3 = $15.

5. **Calculate the total value of three action figures**:
   - Three action figures would be worth $5 × 3 = $15.

6. **Add up all values to find the total worth of the toys**:
   - Total worth = Value of dolls + Value of action figures + Value of red cars
   - Total worth = $15 (doll) + $15 (action figures) + $20 (red cars)
   - Total worth = $50.

Therefore, the total worth of all the toys in the room is $50.<|im_end|>","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.

   - She plans to miss 3 hours of freelance work.

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \text{Hourly Lost Income} \times \text{Number of Hours Missed}
\]

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \$35 \times 3 = \$105

2. **Determine the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90 for their services.

3. **Compare the costs:**
   - If Jackie does the taxes herself, she will lose $105 in income but save $90 on accounting fees.

\[

To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of all the items purchased:**
   - Computer: €1090
   - Screen: €50 (assuming it's part of the computer)
   - Keyboard: €60
   - Mouse: €80
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD Burner: €74
   - Printer: €102

2. **Sum up the costs:**

\[
1090 + 50 + 60 + 80 + 157 + 74 + 102 = 1623
\]

Elvira spends a total of €1623 on the computer and its accessories.

3. **Subtract this amount from her budget:**

Her budget is €1500.

\[
1500 - 1623 = -123
\]

Elvira does not have enough money in her budget to cover the total cost of the computer and its accessories. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} -€123. This means Elvira would be short by €123 to purchase everything she wants.<|im_end|>","First, let’s look at the total cost of computer equipment: 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102 = <<1090+157+74+102=1423>>1423 euros

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans**

Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs.
Therefore, for 15 flans, we need:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect enough eggs**

Sandra receives 9 eggs each time she babysits.
So, we divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs per babysitting session (9):
\[ \frac{45}{9} = 5 \]

**Conclusion:**
Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Seth's current age based on the given information.

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.
   Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

2. **Set up equations based on the given conditions:**

   - According to the first condition, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be written as:
     \[
     S = 2B

   - According to the second condition, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as:
     \[
     (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28

     Simplify the equation:
     \[
     S + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \\
     S + B + 4 = 28 \\
     S + B = 24

3. **Substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
   From \( S = 2B \), substitute \( S \) in \( S + B = 24 \):
   \[
   2B + B = 24 \\
   3B = 24 \\
   B = 8

4. **Find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):**
   Since \( B = 8 \),
   \[
   S = 2 \times 8 \\

1. **Determine the number of days Pancho walks during the weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - Each weekday, Pancho walks 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Total miles walked on weekdays} = 5 \times 20 = 100 \text{ miles}

   - Jacket: Three times the cost of the hat = 3 * $25 = $75
   - Pants: Average of the costs of the hat and jacket = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

2. **Calculate the total cost of one uniform:**
   - Total cost for one uniform = Cost of hat + Cost of jacket + Cost of pants
   - Total cost for one uniform = $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants)

3. **Perform the addition:**

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the number of legs for each group of creatures he encounters and then sum them up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of legs from the spiders.
- Number of spiders = 80
- Each spider has 8 legs
- Total legs from spiders = \( 80 \times 8 = 640 \)

Step 2: Calculate the number of legs from the insects.
- Number of insects = 90
- Each insect has 6 legs
- Total legs from insects = \( 90 \times 6 = 540 \)

Step 3: Calculate the number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates.
- Number of rare mutant invertebrates = 3
- Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs
- Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

Step 4: Sum up all the legs from the different groups.
Total legs = Legs from spiders + Legs from insects + Legs from rare mutant invertebrates

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all four birds based on the given relationships between their ages.

1. **Determine Sally Three's age:**
   - We know that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
   - Since Sally Fortytwo is twice as old as Sally Three, let \( S_3 \) represent Sally Three's age.
     \[
     S_{42} = 2 \times S_3

   - Given \( S_{42} = 8 \):

     8 = 2 \times S_3 \\
     S_3 = \frac{8}{2} = 4

2. **Determine Granny Red's age:**
   - We know that Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Three (\( S_3 \)).
     \[
     G_R = 2 \times S_3
     \]
   - Given \( S_3 = 4 \):
     \[
     G_R = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]

3. **Determine Sally Two's age:**
   - We know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red (\( G_R \)).
     \[
     S_2 = G_R + 3

   - Given \( G_R = 8 \):
     \[
     S_2 = 8 + 3 = 11

4. **Determine Sally Ten's age:**
   - We know that Sally Ten is the same age as Sally Thirty-two (\( S_{42} \)).

   - Given \( S_{42} = 8 \):
     \[
     S_{10} = 8

5. **Calculate the total age of the four birds:**
   - Sum up the ages of Sally Two, Sally Three, Sally Four, and Sally Ten:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = S_2 + S_3 + S_4 + S_{10}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Jessica would pay if she increases her monthly payments by 50%. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the current total monthly payment.
- Student Loans (minimum payment): $300
- Credit Card (minimum payment): $200
- Mortgage (minimum payment): $500

Total monthly payment = Minimum Payment from Student Loans + Minimum Payment from Credit Card + Minimum Payment from Mortgage
= $300 + $200 + $500
= $1000 per month

### Step 2: Determine the increased monthly payment.
Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the current total monthly payment.

Increase amount = Current Total Monthly Payment * 50%
= $1000 * 0.5
= $500

Increased Monthly Payment = Current Monthly Payment + Increase Amount
= $1000 + $500
= $1500 per month

### Step 3: Calculate the annual payment.
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the increased monthly payment by 12 to find the annual payment.

Annual Payment = Increased Monthly Payment * 12
= $1500 * 12
= $18,000 per year

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Jessica would pay \boxed{18000} in a year.<|im_end|>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month

Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

To determine how long it will take Billy to prepare all the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent on both peeling and cutting.

1. **Calculate the number of potatoes Billy needs to peel:**
   - Billy has 60 potatoes.
   - Each potato requires approximately 2 minutes (since 1 minute = 60 seconds).

2. **Calculate the total time required to peel all potatoes:**
   - Time to peel one potato = 2 minutes
   - Number of potatoes = 60
   - Total time = 2 minutes × 60 potatoes = 120 minutes

3. **Calculate the time required to cut each potato:**
   - Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds
   - Number of potatoes = 60
   - Total time = 5 seconds × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

4. **Convert the total time from seconds to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute,
   - Total time = 300 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 5 minutes

5. **Add the time spent peeling and cutting together:**
   - Total time = Time to peel + Time to cut
   - Total time = 120 minutes (peeling) + 5 minutes (cutting)
   - Total time = 125 minutes

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 125 minutes.<|im_end|>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.

                    Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. For each gallon they make it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar. They sell each glass for : $0.50 and get 20 glasses per . gallon. If they made $25 in profit, how much did they spend on ? lemons?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from sales:**
   - Each gallon produces 20 glasses.
   - Each glass sells for $0.50.
   - Total number of glasses sold = \(20 \text{ gallons} \times 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} = 400 \text{ glasses}\).
   - Revenue from sales = \(400 \text{ glasses} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$200\).

2. **Determine the total cost:**
   - Let \(L\) be the amount spent on lemons.
   - The cost of ingredients (lemons + sugar) for one gallon is \(\$3 + \$2 = \$5\).
   - Since they produced 1 gallon, their total cost is \(5 \text{ dollars/gallon} \times 1 \text{ gallon} = \$5\).
   - Profit is defined as total revenue minus total cost.

3. **Set up the equation based on profit:**
   - Profit = Revenue - Cost.
   - Given that they made a profit of \$25, we can write: 
     \[
     \$25 = \$200 - (\$5 + L)
     \]

4. **Solve for \(L\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \(L\):
     \[
     \$25 = \$200 - \$5 - L \\
     \$25 = \$195 - L \\
     L = \$195 - \$25 \\
     L = \$170
     \]

Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $170 on lemons. 

**The final answer is:** {The final answer is} $170.<|im_end|>","Each gallon sells for a total of $10 because 20 x .5 = <<20*.5=10>>10

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Asian participants:**
   The total number of Asian participants in the race is given as 240.

2. **Identify the number of Japanese participants:**
   We know that there are 80 Japanese participants.

3. **Calculate the number of Chinese participants:**
   Since the total number of Asian participants (240) includes both Japanese and Chinese participants, we can find the number of Chinese participants by subtracting the number of Japanese participants from the total number of Asian participants.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Chinese participants} = 240 - 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Given that the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60, determine the number of girls on the Chinese team:**
   Let \( G_c \) represent the number of girls on the Chinese team. According to the information provided, the number of boys on the Chinese team is 60.

5. **Use the fact that the total number of participants in the Chinese team equals the sum of the number of boys and girls on the Chinese team:**
   Since all participants are either boys or girls, the total number of Chinese participants must equal the sum of the number of boys and girls on the Chinese team.

   \[
   G_c + B_c = 160
   \]
   
   Where \( B_c \) represents the number of boys on the Chinese team.

6. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**
   Given \( B_c = 60 \), substitute this value into the equation.

   \[
   G_c + 60 = 160
   \]

7. **Solve for \( G_c \):**
   To find the number of girls on the Chinese team, subtract 60 from 160.

   \[
   G_c = 160 - 60 = 100

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is \( \boxed{100} \).<|im_end|>","If there were 80 Japanese, the number of Chinese was 240-80=<<240-80=160>>160.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationships between the numbers:**
   - Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica.
   - Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monica has:**
   - Since Bo has 40 crabs, we can find out how many crabs Monica has by subtracting 4 from 40.
     \[
     \text{Monica's crabs} = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Since Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica, we add 10 to the number of crabs Monica has.
     \[
     \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 = 46
     \]

4. **Verify the relationship between Monica and Bo:**
   - We know that Monica has 36 crabs, and Bo has 40 crabs. This confirms that Monica indeed has 4 fewer crabs than Bo (since \(40 - 36 = 4\)).

5. **Sum up all the crabs:**
   - Now, we add the number of crabs each person has to get the total number of crabs.
     \[
     \text{Total crabs} = \text{Rani's crabs} + \text{Monica's crabs} + \text{Bo's crabs}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40
     \]

6. **Perform the addition:**
   - Add the numbers together.
     \[
     46 + 36 = 82
     \]
     \[
     82 + 40 = 122

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers Sandra ordered.
Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( W \).

According to the problem:
- Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4W \).
- The number of pink calla lilies is given as 200, and they are 5 times the number of white carnations. This means that \( 200 = 5W \).

From the second equation, we can find \( W \):
\[ 200 = 5W \]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers Sandra ordered.
Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can calculate the total number of flowers:
- Red roses: \( 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160 \)
- White carnations: \( W = 40 \)
- Pink calla lilies: \( 200 \)

Adding these together gives us the total number of flowers Sandra ordered:
\[ 160 (red) + 40 (white) + 200 (pink) = 400 \text{ flowers} \]

### Step 3: Determine the minimum number of red roses needed for Sandra to threaten switching suppliers.
Sandra will threaten to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM. Let's assume Fred delivers some number of red roses, say \( x \). Since Sandra threatens to switch suppliers if there are any missing red roses, she wants at least one red rose delivered.

Since she ordered 160 red roses in total, delivering fewer than 160 red roses would mean no threat from her side, but more than 160 red roses could lead to a threat.

Therefore, the minimum number of red roses Fred needs to deliver to avoid Sandra threatening to switch suppliers is exactly 160.

### Final Answer:

Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age when Jan was 30. So, we need to find out what half of Jan's age would be at that time.

Half of Jan's age = 30 / 2 = 15

Since Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, Mark must have been 15 + 5 = 20 years old when Jan was 30.

So, Mark is currently 20 years old.

Step 2: Calculate Jean's age.
Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean is currently 20 + 2 = 22 years old.

Therefore, Jean is 22 years old.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total distance for both teams:**
   - Each team runs 4 legs (each 400 meters), so the total distance is \(4 \times 400 = 1600\) meters.

2. **Calculate the time taken by the faster team:**
   - The fastest team has runners who complete their laps exactly 55 seconds.
   - Since there are 4 runners on each team, we need to calculate the total time for these runners.

   For the fastest team:
   - Runner 1: 55 seconds
   - Runner 2: 55 seconds
   - Runner 3: 55 seconds
   - Runner 4: 55 seconds
   
   Total time for the fastest team: \(55 + 55 + 55 + 55 = 220\) seconds.

3. **Calculate the time taken by the slower team:**
   - The second-fastest team has runners who complete their laps slightly longer.
   - The first runner takes 60 seconds.
   - Each subsequent runner takes 3 seconds more than the previous one.

   Let's denote the times as follows:
   - Runner 1: 60 seconds
   - Runner 2: 63 seconds
   - Runner 3: 66 seconds
   - Runner 4: 69 seconds

   Total time for the slower team: \(60 + 63 + 66 + 69\).

   Calculate the sum:
   \[
   60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Compare the total times:**
   - Faster team time: 220 seconds
   - Slower team time: 258 seconds

5. **Determine the difference in time:**
   - Difference in time: \(258 - 220 = 38\) seconds

Therefore, the faster team wins by 38 seconds.

**Final Answer:** The faster team wins by 38 seconds.<|im_end|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.

Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                    question:
                    Jerry is rolling , a ? six-sided die. . How much , more likely . is it (expressed ! as ? a percentage) that he rolls ! a ! number greater than 3 than that he rolls two . even numbers in a row?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:**

   A six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6.
   
   - Numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   
   There are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling a number greater than 3.

   The total number of possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die is 6.

   Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{number > 3}) \):
   \[
   P(\text{number > 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
   \]

2. **Calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die:**

   Even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   
   There are 3 favorable outcomes for rolling an even number.

   Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{even number}) \):
   \[
   P(\text{even number}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ or } 50\%
   \]

3. **Determine the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**

   To find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, we multiply the probabilities of each event happening independently.

   Probability of rolling an even number on one roll:
   \[
   P(\text{even number}) = 0.5
   \]
   
   Since the rolls are independent events, multiplying these probabilities gives us the combined probability:
   \[
   P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even number}) \times P(\text{even number}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\%
   \]

4. **Compare the probabilities:**
   
   We have calculated:
   - The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 (\(P(\text{number > 3})\) ) is 50%.
   - The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row (\(P(\text{two even numbers in a row})\) ) is 25%.

5. **Determine how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row:**

   To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3, we calculate the difference between these probabilities.

   Difference in likelihood:
   \[
   \Delta P = P(\text{number > 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers in a row})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \Delta P = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25 \text{ or } 25\%
   \]

Therefore, it is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. 

**Final Answer:**  
The final answer is: 25%.<|im_end|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Jenna and her mother picked apples.
   - Jenna picked ""half as many apples"" as her mom.
   - Her mom picked 20 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked:**
   - Since Jenna picked ""half as many apples"" as her mom, we can calculate this by dividing the number of apples her mom picked by 2.
     \[
     \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{\text{Number of apples her mom picked}}{2}
     \]
     Substituting the known value (20):
     \[
     \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both:**
   - We add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number her mom picked.
     \[
     \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mom picked}
     \]
     Substituting the values calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20 = 30

<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of rats**:
   - We know there are 10 cages for hamsters.
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, if there are 10 cages, then there must be \( \frac{10}{5} = 2 \) hamsters per cage.

2. **Calculate the total number of rats**:
   - Since there are 10 cages for hamsters and each has 2 hamsters, the total number of hamsters (and thus rats) is \( 10 \times 2 = 20 \).

3. **Verify the total number of hamsters**:
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so with 20 hamsters, they receive \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \) pieces of straw.
   - This matches the information given about the hamsters.

4. **Determine the total number of rabbits**:
   - There is only one pen for rabbits.
   - It receives 20 pieces of straw.

5. **Verify the total number of rabbits**:
   - Each rabbit gets 20/20 = 1 piece of straw.
   - This means there are 20 rabbits (since each rabbit gets exactly 1 piece of straw).

6. **Calculate the total number of rodents**:
   - We already calculated that there are 20 hamsters and 20 rabbits.
   - So, the total number of rodents is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \).

7. **Calculate the total amount of straw**:
   - We need to find out how much straw is distributed to these 40 rodents.
   - Let’s denote the total number of rods as \( R \).
   - The distribution of straw can be represented as follows: 
     - 20 hamsters: \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \) pieces of straw.
     - 20 rabbits: \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \) pieces of straw.
   
8. **Set up the equation**:
   - Total straw distributed = Straw for hamsters + Straw for rabbits + Straw for other animals (which is zero since no straw was used elsewhere)
   - \( 120 + 20 + 0 = 160 \)

9. **Solve for the number of rats**:
   - We know the total number of rats is 20.
   - Since we've accounted for all the straw, we now need to determine how many rats are in each cage.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - Given there are 20 hamsters, each getting 6 pieces of straw, the total amount of straw distributed equals the number of hamsters multiplied by their share.
   - Hence, \( 20 \times 6 = 120 \) pieces of straw were distributed among the hamsters.

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is determined by dividing the total number of hamsters by the number of cages, which gives us:
\[ \text{Number of rats in each cage} = \frac{\text{Total number of hamsters}}{\text{Number of cages}} = \frac{20}{\text{Number of cages}} \]

Since we don't have the exact number of cages, but we know that the total number of hamsters is 20, and they are divided equally into cages, the number of rats in each cage will be:
\[ x = \frac{20}{\text{Number of cages}} \]

Given that the total number of hamsters is 20, and they are evenly distributed across cages, the number of rats in each cage would be:
\[ x = 2 \]
Thus, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]<|im_end|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Mandy owed over 3 months.

Mandy originally owes Benedict $100 per month. Since they agreed to add an annual (12-month) interest rate of 2%, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy would owe if she were to continue paying for another year.

- Monthly payment = $100
- Annual interest rate = 2%

First, convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate:
\[ \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{\text{Annual interest rate}}{12} = \frac{2\%}{12} = \frac{0.02}{12} = 0.00167 \% \]

Now, calculate the total amount owed over 3 months:
\[ \text{Total amount owed} = \text{Monthly payment} \times \text{Number of months} \]
\[ \text{Total amount owed} = \$100 \times 3 = \$300 \]

So far, Mandy has paid $300 in three years without any additional payments or deductions.

### Step 2: Determine the remaining debt after 3 months.

Since Mandy only pays for the first 3 months, her total payment will be exactly what she owes at that point. Therefore, she does not need to make any further payments beyond these 3 months.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the amount Mandy needs to give to Benedict is $\boxed{0}$ since she has already fully paid off the debt within the 3-month period.<|im_end|>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cost for transportation**:
   - The cost to transport one bag is $2.
   - Therefore, the total transportation cost for \( x \) bags = \( 2x \).

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags**:
   - The trader sells each bag for $30.
   - So, the total revenue from selling \( x \) bags = \( 30x \).

3. **Calculate the total expenses**:
   - The cost to buy \( x \) bags of wheat at $20 each = \( 20x \).
   - Add the total transportation cost: 
     \[
     \text{Total Expenses} = 20x + 2x = 22x
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for profit**:
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses.
   - Given that the profit is $400, we can write:

1. **Calculate total spending on tickets:**
   - The total amount spent on tickets is given as $20.25.

2. **Determine the cost per ticket:**
   - Since there were 3 friends sharing the tickets, we need to divide the total cost by 3.
     \[
     \text{Cost per ticket} = \frac{\$20.25}{3} = \$6.75
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for rides:**
   - Each friend paid an equal share of the remaining money after buying the tickets, so let's first find out what remains after purchasing the tickets.
   
4. **Subtract the cost of the tickets from the total spent:**
   - Total spent = $20.25 (tickets) + some other expenses (food).
   - Let's assume the rest of their expenses include $4.50 less than the ticket cost, i.e., $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25 on food.
   - So, the total spent excluding food is $20.25 + $2.25 = $22.50.

5. **Divide the remaining money equally among the three friends:**
   - Now, if they spent another $22.50 in addition to the tickets, then each person would contribute equally.
     \[
     \text{Amount each pays} = \frac{\$22.50}{3} = \$7.50

Therefore, each friend will pay $7.50.

   - Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.
   - There are 10 ducks in the flock.

2. **Calculate total weekly insect consumption for all ducks combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Insect Consumption} = \text{Insects per Duck per Week} \times \text{Number of Ducks}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of trees chopped over time
Tom plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year. So, every year, he loses:
\[ 2 \text{ trees/year} \]

Over 10 years, the total number of trees chopped would be:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 2: Determine the initial number of trees
Tom starts with 50 trees.

### Step 3: Calculate the net increase in trees after chopping
Each year, the number of trees increases by:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees/year} \]

So, after 10 years, the total increase in trees is:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total chopped trees from the initial count
After 10 years, the remaining number of trees can be calculated as follows:
\[ 50 + 80 - 20 = 110 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 5: Apply the 30% loss rule
If 30% of the trees die, then:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 110 = 0.30 \times 110 = 33 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 6: Subtract the lost trees from the current count
Finally, subtract the 30% loss from the current number of trees:
\[ 110 - 33 = 77 \text{ trees} \]

### Final Answer
After 10 years, Tom has **77** trees left.<|im_end|>","He gets 10-2=<<10-2=8>>8 new trees a year
After 10 years he has 8*10=<<8*10=80>>80 new trees

He lost 130*.3=<<130*.3=39>>39 trees
That means he had 130-39=<<130-39=91>>91 trees

                    Sue lives in a fun neighborhood. !  One weekend, the : neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.  On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Placement**:
   - On Friday morning, there are 18 pink plastic flamingos.

2. **First Removal and Repositioning**:
   - On Saturday morning, the neighbors take away one-third of the flamingos.
     \[
     \text{Number of flamingos taken} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
     \]
   - They paint these flamingos white and put them back on Sue's front yard.
     \[
     \text{Remaining flamingos after removal} = 18 - 6 = 12
     \]

3. **Final Count After Repositioning**:
   - There are now 12 flamingos on the lawn (all pink).

4. **Second Addition**:
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink, plastic flamingos.
     \[
     \text{Total number of flamingos after addition} = 12 + 18 = 30
     \]

5. **Counting Flamingos**:
   - Out of the 30 flamingos, all are pink.
   - Therefore, there are no white flamingos at any point during this process.

Since all the flamingos are pink and not white, we can conclude that the number of pink flamingos is equal to the total number of flamingos.

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are \(30\) pink plastic flamingos out, which means there are no white flamingos left.

Hence, the number of pink flamingos exceeds the number of white flamingos by \(0\).

Ending Answer: The final answer is {The final answer is} 0.<|im_end|>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.

On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of crayons Violetta needs:**
   - Violetta wants to buy 5 different colors of crayons.
   
2. **Calculate the total cost if one crayon costs $2:**
   - Since she needs 5 crayons, we multiply the cost per crayon by the number of crayons.
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10
     \]

3. **Subtract the total cost from the amount Violetta has ($20):**
   - To find out how much change she gets, subtract the total cost from the amount she has.
     \[
     \text{Change} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10
     \]

Therefore, Violetta will get back $10 in change.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many pencils can be bought for the given amount.
Given that one pen costs as much as one pencil plus one eraser, we need to find out how many pencils can be bought if one eraser costs $0.30.

Let \( P \) represent the number of pencils that can be bought for one pen. According to the problem, one pen costs as much as one pencil plus one eraser, which means:
\[ P = 1 + 1 \]
Since we don't know the exact value yet, let's denote the total cost for \( P \) pencils as \( C_p \).

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of one pen.
We know from the information provided that one pencil costs $1.20, so:
\[ C_p = 120 \times P \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 8 pens.
If we buy 8 pens, the total cost would be:
\[ Total\ Cost_{8Pens} = 8 \times (C_p) \]

Now, substitute \( C_p \) in terms of \( P \):
\[ Total\ Cost_{8Pens} = 8 \times (120 \times P) \]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression.
Simplify the equation:
\[ Total\ Cost_{8Pens} = 960 \times P \]

### Step 5: Find the value of \( P \).
From Step 1, we determined that \( P \) represents the number of pencils that can be bought for one pen. Since one eraser costs $0.30, and the total cost of one pen includes both the cost of one pencil and one eraser, we have:
\[ 1 + 0.30 = 1.30 \]

Therefore, the cost of one pen is $1.30. Now, substitute \( P = 1 \) (since one pencil costs $1.20, we can consider buying only one pencil for simplicity):

### Final Calculation:
\[ Total\ Cost_{8Pens} = 960 \times 1 = 960 \]

Thus, the total cost for 8 pens is **$960**.<|im_end|>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.
So, 8 pens cost $1.50 x 8 = $<<8*1.5=12>>12.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots needed:**
   - There are 40 restaurants.
   - Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots.

   \[
   \text{Total pounds} = \text{Number of restaurants} \times \text{Pounds per restaurant}
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Total pounds} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how much of the total carrots can be distributed:**
   - We have a total of 200 pounds of carrots.

   \[
   \text{Pounds distributed} = \text{Total pounds} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Subtract the distributed amount from the total amount available:**
   - The remaining amount that cannot be distributed will be what we're looking for.

   \[
   \text{Remaining pounds} = \text{Total pounds} - \text{Pounds distributed}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Remaining pounds} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cards**:
   - Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards.

2. **First Month Collection**:
   - She collects three times her initial amount.
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.

3. **Second Month Collection**:
   - She collects 20 fewer cards than what she collected in the first month.

4. **Third Month Collection**:
   - She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first two months.
   - Combined number from first two months: \(60 + 40 = 100\).
   - Calculation for the third month: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.

5. **Total Number of Cards**:
   - Add up all the collections over the three months.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total number of 1000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents , per sentence. How much does Mark make in a week, in cents?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the earnings from Publisher A
Mark earns 5 cents per sentence from Publisher A.

Given:
- Total sentences edited = 1000 sentences
- Earnings per sentence from Publisher A = 5 cents

Earnings from Publisher A:
\[
1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the earnings from Publisher B
Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A per sentence.

Given:
- Earnings per sentence from Publisher A = 5 cents
- Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A

Therefore, earnings per sentence from Publisher B:
\[
5 \text{ cents} \times 2 = 10 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from Publisher B
Total earnings from Publisher B can be calculated similarly to the one from Publisher A.

Given:
- Total sentences edited = 1000 sentences
- Earnings per sentence from Publisher B = 10 cents

Earnings from Publisher B:
\[
1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all earnings
Now, add up the earnings from both Publishers:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 5000 \text{ cents (from Publisher A)} + 10000 \text{ cents (from Publisher B)}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 15000 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer:
Mark makes a total of **15000** cents in a week.<|im_end|>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.
Thus, he earns 2500 + 5000 = <<2500+5000=7500>>7500 cents in total.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water Baldur drinks in total over one day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pails Baldur uses per day:**
   - Baldur gets water twice a day (morning and afternoon).
   - In the morning, he uses 5 pails.
   - In the afternoon, he uses 6 pails.

2. **Calculate the total number of pails used per day:**
   \[
   5 \text{ pails (morning)} + 6 \text{ pails (afternoon)} = 11 \text{ pails}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of water each pail holds:**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water used per day:**
   \[
   11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail} = 55 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, Baldur gets a total of \(55\) liters of water every day.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\).<|im_end|>","Baldur gets 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25 liters of water in the morning.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money John made over the course of the year after receiving his award. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate John's weekly earnings including the raise
John receives a 5% raise in salary per week.

- Original weekly salary: $2000
- Raise percentage: 5%

First, let's find out how much the raise is:

\[ \text{Raise} = \text{Original Salary} \times \frac{\text{Raise Percentage}}{100} \]

\[ \text{Raise} = \$2000 \times \frac{5}{100} \]
\[ \text{Raise} = \$2000 \times 0.05 \]
\[ \text{Raise} = \$100 \]

Now add the raise to his original salary to get his new weekly salary:

\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = \text{Original Salary} + \text{Raise} \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = \$2000 + \$100 \]
\[ \text{New Weekly Salary} = \$2100 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for the entire year
Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can now calculate his total earnings for the year:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{New Weekly Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$2100 \times 52 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$2100 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$112,200 \]

So, John made a total of $112,200 in the year after receiving the award.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total amount of grapes produced in one year:**
   - Josie's farm has an area of 10 acres.
   - Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year.
   
   \[
   \text{Total grapes per year} = 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre/year}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total grapes per year} = 50 \text{ tons/year}
   \]

2. **Convert the total amount of grapes into barrels of wine:**
   - Each ton of grapes can be turned into 2 barrels of wine.

   \[
   \text{Total barrels of wine} = 50 \text{ tons/year} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total barrels of wine} = 100 \text{ barrels/year}

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many slices of cheese Carl used, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Sandwiches**:
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Carl eats 5 sandwiches (lunch + 3 breakfasts).
   - Total slices from sandwiches = 5 * 2 = 10 slices.

2. **Omelets**:
   - Each omelet uses 4 slices of cheese (one more than a sandwich).
   - Carl makes 3 omelets.
   - Total slices from omelets = 3 * 4 = 12 slices.

3. **Macaroni and Cheese**:
   - This is his main meal that lasts several dinners.
   - He uses 8 slices of cheese for this dish.
   - This is the total number of slices needed for all dinners.

Now we sum up the total number of slices:
- From sandwiches: 10 slices.
- From omelets: 12 slices.
- From Macaroni and Cheese: 8 slices.

Total slices of cheese used = 10 (sandwiches) + 12 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese).

Let's add these numbers together:

\[ 
\text{Total slices} = 10 + 12 + 8 = 30

To determine how many pens Janet has in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of green pens:**
   Janet initially has 22 green pens.

2. **Calculate the number of yellow pens:**
   Janet also has 10 yellow pens.

3. **Calculate the number of blue pens:**
   Janet buys 6 bags of blue pens.
   
   - Each bag contains 9 blue pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of blue pens = \( 6 \times 9 \).

4. **Calculate the number of red pens:**
   Janet buys 2 bags of red pens.
   
   - Each bag contains 6 red pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens = \( 2 \times 6 \).

5. **Sum up all the pens:**

Let's perform the calculations:

- Green pens: 22
- Yellow pens: 10
- Blue pens: 
  \[
  6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens per bag} = 54 \text{ pens}
  \]
- Red pens: 
  \[
  2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens per bag} = 12 \text{ pens}

Now, add all the pens together:
\[
22 \text{ (green)} + 10 \text{ (yellow)} + 54 \text{ (blue)} + 12 \text{ (red)}

                    question:
                    Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score . from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To find out how many points Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of all six test scores:**
   - We know that Brinley wants an average of 93 over six tests.
   - The formula for the average (mean) is: \(\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{\text{Number of Scores}}\).
   - Plugging in the values, we have: \(93 = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{6}\).

2. **Solve for the Total Sum:**
   - To isolate the total sum, multiply both sides by 6: 
     \[
     93 \times 6 = \text{Total Sum}
     \]
   - Simplifying this multiplication gives us: 
     \[
     558 = \text{Total Sum}
     \]

3. **Determine the required sum excluding the lowest score:**
   - We know Brinley removes the lowest score. Let’s denote her lowest score as \(x\). Her other scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

4. **Calculate the sum of the remaining scores:**
   - Since removing the lowest score reduces the sum by \(x\), we subtract \(x\) from the total sum obtained earlier: 
     \[
     \text{Sum of remaining scores} = 558 - x
     \]

5. **Find the minimum value of \(x\):**
   - \(x\) must be at least the smallest score among the given scores. So, let's check them:
     \[
     \min(89, 71, 92, 100, 86) = 71
     \]
   - Therefore, \(x = 71\).

6. **Substitute back into our equation:**
   - Substitute \(x = 71\) into the equation for the sum of the remaining scores:
     \[
     \text{Sum of remaining scores} = 558 - 71 = 487
     \]

7. **Calculate the score needed on the sixth test:**
   - Brinley already scored 89, so we add the difference between the target average and her current average to find out what additional score she needs:
     \[
     \text{Score needed} = 93 - \left(\frac{487}{5}\right)
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{487}{5} = 97.4
     \]
   - Subtract this from 93:
     \[
     93 - 97.4 = -4.4
     \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score more than 97.4 on her sixth test to reach an average of 93. This indicates she will exceed her current average without needing to adjust her scores further. 

**Final Answer:** Brinley needs to score more than 97.4 on the sixth test to ensure her average remains above 93.<|im_end|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

                    question:
                    Micheal loves riding a bike. He rode ; it at least 5 times a week ; and ? makes . 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and then he decided, to ride the ! bike only 2 times a week, but for 60 kilometers each : time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down Michael's biking schedule into two parts: his initial 4-week period and his subsequent 3-week period.

### Initial 4-Week Period:

1. **Frequency**: At least 5 times per week.
2. **Distance per trip**: 25 km.
3. **Number of trips per week**: Let \( n \) be the number of rides per week during this period.
4. **Total distance** = Distance per trip * Number of trips per week * Number of weeks

Since we know the total distance covered over these 4 weeks, we can set up an equation based on the information given.

Given:
\[ 25n \times 4 = \text{total distance} \]

Let’s denote the total distance as \( D_1 \).

### Subsequent 3-Week Period:

1. **Frequency**: Only 2 times per week.
2. **Distance per trip**: 60 km.
3. **Number of trips per week**: Let \( m \) be the number of rides per week during this period.
4. **Total distance** = Distance per trip * Number of trips per week * Number of weeks

Similarly, let’s denote the total distance covered during this 3-week period as \( D_2 \).

We need to find the values of \( n \), \( m \), and calculate both distances.

### Solving for Total Distance:

First, let's determine how many miles Michael traveled during the initial 4-week period:

\[ D_1 = 25n \times 4 \]

Now, we will find out how far he went during the subsequent 3-week period:

\[ D_2 = 60m \times 3 \]

Finally, summing these distances gives us the total distance:

\[ D_{\text{total}} = D_1 + D_2 \]

To proceed further, we need more specific details about the frequency \( n \) and \( m \). However, if you provide those values or any other constraints, I can compute the exact numbers.

For now, without knowing \( n \) and \( m \):

\[ \boxed{\text{No numerical value provided}} \]<|im_end|>","In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.

After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the weights given:**
   - Each chocolate bar weighs 40 g.
   - Each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar.

2. **Calculate the weight of one candied apple:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ g}}{2} = 20 \text{ g}

3. **Determine the number of each type of candy:**
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - There are 80 candied apples.

4. **Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight per chocolate bar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ g} = 1000 \text{ g}

6. **Sum the total weights to find the overall weight of the candy bag:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of the candy bag} = \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} + \text{Total weight of candied apples}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of the candy bag} = 1000 \text{ g} + 1600 \text{ g} = 2600 \text{ g}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cakes Rose buys over the three days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Monday:**
   - She bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - She bought three times the amount she bought on Monday.
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

3. **Wednesday:**

Now, let's sum up the total number of cakes purchased over the three days:

- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

Total cakes bought in three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60\]

Let's perform the addition:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

### Step 2: Convert the quantities into numerical values
- One dozen = 12
- Half a dozen = 12 / 2 = 6
- Therefore, twenty dozen cups = 20 * 12 = 240

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the given information
Let \( C \) be the total cost of one plate (half a dozen).

Given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates, we can write:
\[ 240C - C = 1200 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ 239C = 1200 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)
Divide both sides by 239:
\[ C = \frac{1200}{239} \approx 5 \]

So, the total cost of one plate is approximately $5.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of buying each cup
Since we have already determined that one plate costs about $5, then twenty dozens of cups will also cost approximately $5 per cup.

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]<|im_end|>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.

To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to save enough money for the jacket and shoes, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.
- Jacket: $30
- Shoes: Each pair costs $20, so two pairs would be \(2 \times 20 = \$40\).
- Total cost: \( \$30 + \$40 = \$70 \)

### Step 2: Determine how much Sara earns from babysitting.
- She earns $5 per session and works 4 sessions each week.
- Weekly earnings from babysitting: \(4 \times 5 = \$20\).

### Step 3: Determine how much Sara earns from mowing the lawn.
- Her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of times she mows the lawn.

### Step 4: Set up an equation based on her total savings.
Sara already has $10 saved before starting to work. We need to find out how many times she must mow the lawn to reach or exceed her goal of saving $70.

Total amount needed after accounting for her initial savings: 
\[ \$70 - \$10 = \$60 \]

This $60 should come from both her babysitting earnings and her earnings from mowing the lawn.

From babysitting, her weekly earnings will be:
\[ \$20 \text{ (weekly)} \times x \]
So her total earnings from babysitting over \( x \) weeks will be:
\[ \$20x \]

Her earnings from mowing the lawn will be:
\[ \$4 \text{ (per session)} \times x \]

Therefore, the total amount she saves in dollars from babysitting and mowing the lawn is:
\[ \$20x + 4x \]

We set this equal to her goal of $60:
\[ 20x + 4x = 60 \]
\[ 24x = 60 \]
\[ x = \frac{60}{24} \]
\[ x = 2.5 \]

Since Sara cannot mow the lawn half a time, we round up to the next whole number because even if she doesn't quite reach her goal, it still counts as one full session.

Thus, Sara must mow the lawn **3 times** to save at least $60, which is sufficient to cover the cost of the jacket and shoes.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{3}\).<|im_end|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.
Sara will need to save a total of $30 + $40 = $<<30+40=70>>70 to buy everything that she wants.
Sara has earned 4 * $5 = $<<4*5=20>>20 from babysitting.
Between her savings and the babysitting, Sara has already saved $10 + $20 = $<<10+20=30>>30.
Sara needs to earn an additional $70 - $30 = $<<70-30=40>>40 from mowing the lawn to afford her clothes.
Sara must mow the lawn $40 / $4 = <<40/4=10>>10 times to afford to buy the jacket and shoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of red chickens.

1. Let's define \( R \) as the number of red chickens.
2. Since there are two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens would be \( R + 2 \).

Next, let's determine the total number of eggs produced per day from both types of chickens:

- Red chickens produce 3 eggs/day: Total from red chickens = \( 3R \).
- White chickens produce 5 eggs/day: Total from white chickens = \( 5(R + 2) \).

Given that Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:
\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8R = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ R = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has **4** red chickens.<|im_end|>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the park**

Given that the park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles by 6 miles, we can calculate its perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (length + width) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Determine the time spent walking**

Gary's speed is 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends **5 hours** walking.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of customers on the second day.
- On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
- On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day.

So, the calculation for the second day is:
\[ \text{Number of customers on the second day} = 100 + 50 = 150 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of customers on the third day.
- We know that the total number of customers over three days is 500.
- We already calculated the number of customers on the first two days as 100 and 150 respectively.

Therefore, the number of customers on the third day can be found by subtracting the total number of customers from the first two days from the overall total:
\[ \text{Number of customers on the third day} = 500 - (100 + 150) \]
\[ \text{Number of customers on the third day} = 500 - 250 \]
\[ \text{Number of customers on the third day} = 250 \]

### Final Answer:
Sloane counted **250** customers on the third day.<|im_end|>","On the second day, she counted 100+50 = <<100+50=150>>150 customers.

How much water does , the small ; pool have ? now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the initial amount of water in the big pool.
   - Let \( S \) be the initial amount of water in the small pool.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The leak rate for both pools is 4 gallons per minute.
   - 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.

3. **Water Levels Over Time:**
   - After 4 minutes, the big pool has leaked out 4 * 4 = 16 gallons less than its initial volume.
   - After 4 minutes, the small pool has leaked out 4 * 4 = 16 gallons more than its initial volume.

4. **Big Pool's Condition (after 4 minutes):**
   - If the big pool was leaking at 4 gallons per minute for 4 minutes, then after 4 minutes, it would have lost 16 gallons.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount in the big pool is \( B - 16 \).

5. **Small Pool's Condition (after 4 minutes):**
   - Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, we can set up an equation to find the relationship between their volumes:
     \[
     B = 2S
     \]

6. **Equating the Volumes:**
   - We know that the big pool has lost 16 gallons since 4 minutes ago:
     \[
     B - 16 = S
     \]
   - Substitute \( B = 2S \) from the previous equation:
     \[
     2S - 16 = S
     \]

7. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
     \[
     S = 16
     \]

8. **Calculate Big Pool's Volume:**
   - Using \( B = 2S \):
     \[
     B = 2 \times 16 = 32
     \]

9. **Final Answer:**
   - The small pool originally had 16 gallons, but now it has half that amount because the big pool has become four times larger:
     \[
     \text{Current amount in the small pool} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The small pool now has **8 gallons** of water.<|im_end|>","First find how many gallons of water flow out of the pools in 4 minutes: 4 gallons/minute * 4 minutes = <<4*4=16>>16 gallons
Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16
Dividing both sides by 2, we get s = <<8=8>>8

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Lori needs to work at her part-time job in order to afford both the shoes and the belt.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Lori wants:**
   - Cost of shoes = $320.00
   - Cost of belt = $32.00
   - Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

2. **Determine the amount Lori earns per hour from her part-time job:**
   - Hourly wage = $8.00

3. **Calculate the number of hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00:**
   \[
   \text{Number of hours} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{352}{8}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{352}{8} = 44
   \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work for **44** hours before she can afford both the shoes and the belt.

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay.
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promises to add 10% interest on top of that.

Interest = 10% of $2000
Interest = 0.10 * $2000
Interest = $200

Total amount to repay = Principal + Interest
Total amount to repay = $2000 + $200
Total amount to repay = $2200

### Step 2: Determine how many payments Janeth has made so far.
Janeth makes monthly payments of $165 for 12 months.

Number of payments made = 12

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance after all payments have been made.
Since Janeth only pays $165 per month, her total payment over 12 months would be:

Total paid = Payment per month * Number of months
Total paid = $165 * 12
Total paid = $1980

Now, subtract the total paid from the total amount needed to repay:

Remaining balance = Total amount to repay - Total paid
Remaining balance = $2200 - $1980
Remaining balance = $220

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance at the end of 12 months will be **$220**.<|im_end|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of roses**: We know that there are 4 roses in the vase.

2. **Determine the difference between dahlias and roses**: The problem states that there are ""7! more"" dahlias than roses. However, since factorial (denoted as ""!"") is not defined for negative integers or non-integer values, we must assume that the ""more"" refers to an integer value rather than a factorial. Let's proceed with assuming it means 7 additional dahlias.

3. **Calculate the number of dahlias**: If there are 7 more dahlias than roses, then the total number of dahlias would be \( \text{Number of Dahlias} = \text{Number of Roses} + 7 \).

   - Number of Roses: 4
   - Number of Dahlias: \( 4 + 7 = 11 \)

4. **Add the number of roses and dahlias together**: To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias.

   - Total Flowers: \( \text{Roses} + \text{Dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, then calculate their average age after three years.

Step 1: Determine Harriet's current age.
Harriet is currently 21 years old.

Step 2: Determine Harriet's age in three years.
\[ \text{Harriet's age in three years} = 21 + 3 = 24 \]

Step 3: Determine Adrian's age based on Harriet's age.
Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Step 4: Determine Zack's age based on Harriet's age.
Harriet's age is half of Zack's age.
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Step 5: Calculate the total current age of the three individuals.
\[ \text{Total current age} = 21 + 63 + 42 = 126 \]

Step 6: Calculate the total future age for the next three years.
\[ \text{Future age difference per year} = 21 + 63 + 42 = 126 \]
\[ \text{Future age difference over three years} = 3 \times 126 = 378 \]

### Step 1: Calculate Naomi's Points
Naomi scored 68 points.

### Step 2: Calculate Yuri's Points
Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points.
- Half of Naomi's points = \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
- Yuri's points = \( 34 + 10 = 44 \)

### Step 3: Calculate Brianna's Points
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
- Naomi's points = 68
- Brianna's points = \( 68 + 17 = 85 \)

### Step 4: Calculate Total Points Scored by All Students
Total points scored by all four students = 251 points

### Step 5: Calculate Jojo's Points
Let's denote the number of points Jojo scored as \( J \).

We know that the sum of all points scored by the four students equals 251 points.
\[ J + (Naomi's\ points) + (Yuri's\ points) + (Brianna's\ points) = 251 \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ J + 68 + 44 + 85 = 251 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank**:
   - The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters.

2. **Amount of water Celine uses**:
   - Celine uses 90 liters of water for her garden.
   
3. **Water remaining after Celine uses some**:
   - After using 90 liters, the remaining water in the tank will be:
     \[
     120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Amount of rainwater collected**:
   - The amount of rainwater collected is twice the amount of water left in the tank.
   - Since there were 30 liters left in the tank, the amount of rainwater collected would be:
     \[
     2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Total amount of water in the tank after collecting rainwater**:
   - The total amount of water in the tank after adding the rainwater would be:
     \[
     30 \text{ liters (remaining)} + 60 \text{ liters (rainwater)} = 90 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, the number of liters of water in the tank now is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given quantities**:
   - Andy plants 90 geraniums.
   - Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

2. **Calculate the number of petunias**:
   - Since there are 40 fewer petunias compared to geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.
     \[
     \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of flowers**:
   - We add the number of geraniums and petunias together.
     \[
     \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 (\text{geraniums}) + 50 (\text{petunias}) = 140

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the amount spent in the second year**

- The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year.
- They spend one-third of this amount on advertising for the second year.

Let's calculate one-third of $15000:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent over the two years**

- The cost for the first year is $15000.
- The cost for the second year is $5000.

Now, add these amounts together to find the total:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both Carlos and Benji's rental activities separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Carlos's Rental Cost
- **Cost per hour**: $30
- **Number of hours**: 3

\[
\text{Carlos's Total Cost} = \text{Cost per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

\[
\text{Carlos's Total Cost} = \$30 \times 3 = \$90
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Benji's Rental Cost
- **Cost per hour**: $18
- **Number of hours**: 5

\[
\text{Benji's Total Cost} = \text{Cost per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

\[
\text{Benji's Total Cost} = \$18 \times 5 = \$90

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of days for the journey by bus:**
   - The total time taken for the entire trip is 6 days.
   - Half of this time is spent traveling by car (since there are two halves in the journey).
   - Therefore, the time spent on the bus = 6 days / 2 = 3 days.

2. **Determine the distance between New Jersey and Rochester:**
   - We know that Andrew plans to travel by bus first.
   - After reaching Rochester via bus, he will then travel back by car.
   - Since the bus ride covers the same distance as the round trip by car, we can assume that the bus ride alone would cover the total distance twice (once going and once returning).

3. **Calculate the distance covered by bus:**
   - If the bus ride takes 3 days, and assuming the bus travels at an average speed, we need more information to calculate the exact distance. However, since we don't have the actual speed or distance data, we'll use the given information directly.
   
4. **Calculate the remaining time after the bus journey:**
   - After the bus journey, Andrew has 3 days left to travel by car.
   - This means he will spend these 3 days driving back to New Jersey.

5. **Calculate the return journey by car:**
   - The return journey by car also takes 3 days.

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is calculated as follows:
- Days by bus: 3 days
- Days by car: 3 days

Total travel days = 3 + 3 = 6 days

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of each type of card after the changes**

- **Water Type**: Initially, there are 40 water type cards.
  - After losing 8 water type cards, the remaining number of water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32.

- **Grass Type**: Initially, there are 20 grass type cards.
  - After buying 14 more grass type cards, the total number of grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34.

- **Fire Type**: There are already 30 fire type cards.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards**
  
   Total number of cards = Fire type + Grass type + Water type
   
   = 30 + 34 + 32
  
   = 96

**Step 3: Determine the new number of water type cards**

After the changes, there are 32 water type cards.

**Step 4: Calculate the probability of picking a water type card**

Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes)
   
   Probability (water type) = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards)
   
   = (32 / 96)

**Step 5: Convert the probability to a percentage**

To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

   Percentage chance = (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33%

**Final Answer:** The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is approximately 33%. Rounded to the nearest integer, the final answer is 33%.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 33%.<|im_end|>","First find the final number of grass type Pokemon: 20 grass type + 14 grass type = <<20+14=34>>34 grass type

Then add the number of each type of Pokemon to find the total number: 34 Pokemon + 32 Pokemon + 30 Pokemon = <<34+32+30=96>>96 Pokemon
Then divide the number of water type Pokemon by the total number of Pokemon and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 32 water type / 96 Pokemon * 100% = 33.333...%, which rounds down to 33%

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the initial cost of the burrito:**
   - Base price of the burrito: $6.50
   - Total additional costs (meat, cheese, avocado, and sauces): 
     - Meat: $2.00
     - Cheese: $1.00
     - Avocado: $1.00
     - Sauces: 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
   - Adding these together: $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $5.50

   So, the total initial cost before any upgrades or discounts is:
   \[
   6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
   \]

2. **Add up all the additional items added:**
   - Extra toppings (chips and drink) not included in the initial calculation.
   - Additional costs:
     - Chips: $3.00
     - Drink: $3.00
   - Adding these together: $3.00 + $3.00 = $6.00

3. **Subtract the discount from the total cost after adding the extras:**
   - Discount on the burrito ($5.00)
   - Subtracting this from the total cost: $12.00 - $5.00 = $7.00

4. **Calculate the remaining amount owed after applying the gift card:**
   - Gift card value: $5.00
   - Subtracting the gift card from the remaining amount: $7.00 - $5.00 = $2.00

Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is:
\[
\boxed{2.00}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the puzzle, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rate at which Kalinda adds pieces:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine the rate at which Kalinda's mom places pieces:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
     \[
     \text{Mom's placement rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate their combined placement rate:**
   - Combined placement rate = Kalinda's addition rate + Mom's placement rate
     \[
     \text{Combined rate} = 4 \text{ (Kalinda)} + 2 \text{ (Mom)} = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

4. **Find out how many minutes it takes for them to complete one-third of the puzzle:**
   - Since the puzzle has 360 pieces, completing one-third requires:
     \[
     \text{Pieces in one-third} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - Time to complete 120 pieces together:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}

                    question:
                    A : watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. Ashlyn went to the farm after two months and found out that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home. When she came back two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so she harvested them. How many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months.
- Total watermelons initially on the farm: \( 120 \)
- Percentage of watermelons ready for harvest after two months: \( 30\% \)

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two months} = 120 \times \frac{30}{100} \]

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two months} = 120 \times 0.30 \]

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two months} = 36 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many watermelons remained after two months.
- Number of watermelons remaining after two months:

\[ \text{Remaining watermelons} = 120 - 36 \]

\[ \text{Remaining watermelons} = 84 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks.
- Watermelons ready after two months: \( 36 \)
- Fraction of watermelons ready after two weeks: \( \frac{3}{4} \)

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two weeks} = 36 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two weeks} = 36 \times 0.75 \]

\[ \text{Number of watermelons ready after two weeks} = 27 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many watermelons remained after two weeks.
- Number of watermelons remaining after two weeks:

\[ \text{Remaining watermelons} = 84 - 27 \]

\[ \text{Remaining watermelons} = 57 \]

### Conclusion:
After considering all the given information, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{57} \]<|im_end|>","When Ashlyn found out that 30% of the melons were ready, she took home 30/100 *120 = <<30/100*120=36>>36 watermelons.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before taxes and fees.
Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each.

\[
\text{Total Cost Before Taxes} = 12 \times \$20,000 = \$240,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the tax on the cars.
He pays 10% tax on the cars.

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 10\% \times \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000
\]

### Step 3: Add the registration fee to the total cost.
He has to pay an additional $1,000 per car for registration.

\[
\text{Registration Fee} = 12 \times \$1,000 = \$12,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost including tax and registration.
Now we add the tax amount and the registration fee to the initial total cost.

\[
\text{Total Cost Including Tax and Registration} = \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000
\]

### Final Answer:
He pays a total of $\boxed{276,000}$ for everything.<|im_end|>","The cars cost 20000*12=$<<20000*12=240000>>240,000

So the cars cost 240,000+24,000=$<<240000+24000=264000>>264,000
Registration cost another 12*1000=<<12*1000=12000>>12,000
So his total cost is 264,000+12,000=$<<264000+12000=276000>>276,000

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine how many shells Robert collected on Monday:**
   - According to the information provided, Robert collected 20 shells.

2. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Monday:**
   - Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert.
   - Therefore, the number of shells Kylie collected on Monday = \( 20 + 5 \).

3. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday:**
   - The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many shells as she did on Monday.
   - First, find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
     \[
     \text{Shells on Monday} = 20
     \]
   - Then calculate how many shells she collected on Tuesday.
     \[
     \text{Shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times (\text{Shells on Monday}) = 2 \times 20
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication for the number of shells collected on Tuesday:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of ants:**
   - We know that the number of ants is given as 50.

2. **Calculate the number of bugs:**
   - According to the information provided, there are half as many bugs as ants.
     \[
     \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{\text{Number of ants}}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the known value for ants:
     \[
     \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects:**
   - The total number of insects (bugs + ants) can be calculated by adding the number of ants and the number of bugs together.
     \[
     \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs}

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: We start with 36 penguins.

2. **First Jumping Event**:
   - One-third of these penguins jump into the ocean.
   - To find out how many penguins jump into the ocean, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins.
   
3. **Remaining Penguins After First Jumping**:
   - Subtract the number that jumped from the initial count: 
     \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) penguins remain after the first event.

4. **Second Event (Going Inside)**:
   - Another one-third of the remaining penguins go inside the cave.
   - To find out how many penguins go inside, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8 \) penguins.
   
5. **Final Count After Second Event**:
   - Subtract the number that went inside from the remaining count:
     \( 24 - 8 = 16 \) penguins are left after both events.

Therefore, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 16.

{The final answer is}. 16.<|im_end|>","This many penguins are swimming: 36/3 = <<36/3=12>>12 penguins.

<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Steve wants to eat more tomatoes.
- Steve grows his own cherry tomatoes.
- His girlfriend also eats tomatoes.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend per day.
- Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- A single vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of tomatoes consumed per day
Steve consumes 6 tomatoes per day. Since his girlfriend eats half as much as Steve, she consumes:

\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Together, they consume:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the weekly consumption for both
Since there are 7 days in a week, their combined weekly consumption would be:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week} \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of tomatoes produced by one vine per week
We know that one vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of vines needed
To find out how many vines are required to meet their weekly demand, we divide the total number of tomatoes needed (63) by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine (3):

\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Steve needs **21** vines to grow enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend over the course of a week.<|im_end|>","His girlfriend eats 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 tomatoes per day

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas John needs to order so that he can ensure every friend gets 4 slices.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the total number of slices needed**:
   - Each of the 20 friends should get 4 slices.
   - Total slices needed = Number of friends × Slices per friend
     \[
     \text{Total slices} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of pizza slices per pizza**:
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas required**:
   - To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.
     \[
     \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{80}{8} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

Therefore, John needs to order **10 pizzas** to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.<|im_end|>","John's 20 friends each need 4 slices, so that means 4*20= <<4*20=80>>80 slices are needed

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Ink Consumption**: Let's assume that each pen has its own supply of ink (let's call this ""ink""). When Ram uses these pens, some ink will be consumed in each use.

3. **Mixing Pens for Ink Savings**:
   - Ram finds out that he can mix ink from several pens to create one full pen.
   - Specifically, he discovers that he can save money by mixing the ink; from five empty pens to make one full pen.

4. **Calculating Total Pencils Needed**:
   - Ram starts with 25 pens.
   - To determine how many total pencils he gets after using all his pens, we need to calculate how many sets of five pens he can form before running out of ink.

5. **Using the Incomplete Set**:
   - Each set of five pens consumes an amount of ink equivalent to making a new pen.
   - Therefore, Ram can form 25 / 5 = 5 complete sets of five pens before he runs out of ink.
   
6. **Calculating New Pencils Made**:
   - For every set of five pens used, Ram makes one new pencil.
   - Since he can form 5 sets of five pens, he will make 5 new pencils.

7. **Total Pencils After Using All Pens**:
   - Initially, he had 25 pens.
   - He made 5 new pencils during the process.
   - So, the total number of pencils he ends up with is 25 + 5 = 30.

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pencils. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 pencils.<|im_end|>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Determine Johnny's initial amount before adding any extra money.
Johnny starts with $20 as his allowance.

### Step 2: Add the extra money to Johnny's initial amount.
He adds an additional $10 to his allowance.

\[ \text{Initial Amount} = \$20 \]
\[ \text{Extra Money} = \$10 \]

So, the total amount before investing:

\[ \$20 + \$10 = \$30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much the money triples in one year.
If the money triples in one year, that means the total becomes three times its original value.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Johnny has at the end of the year.

Given that the money triples:

\[ x = 3 \times \$30 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
Now we calculate \( x \):

\[ x = 3 \times \$30 \]
\[ x = \$90 \]

Therefore, after one year, Johnny would have $90 from his investment.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa and then find their total age.

1. **Determine Joan's age:**
   - We know that Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Jessa is 20 years old.
   - Therefore, Joan’s age = Jessa’s age + 5.
     \[
     \text{Joan’s age} = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Determine Mary's age:**
   - We know that Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Joan is 25 years old.
   - Therefore, Mary’s age = Joan’s age - 2.
     \[
     \text{Mary’s age} = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the ages of the three girls:**
   - Add up the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Number of Students**:
   - There were initially 1000 students in the hall.

2. **Students Leaving Through Exit A**:
   - Out of these 1000 students, 30% went out through exit A.
   - Calculation: \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\)
   
3. **Remaining Students After Exit A**:
   - After exiting through exit A, the number of students left in the hall is:
     \(1000 - 300 = 700\)

4. **Students Leaving Through Exit B**:
   - Now, 3/5 of the remaining students (700) went out through exit B.
   - Calculation: \(700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420\)
   
5. **Remaining Students After Exit B**:
   - After exiting through exit B, the number of students left in the hall is:
     \(700 - 420 = 280\)

6. **Students Leaving Through Exit C**:
   - The rest of the students (those not leaving through A or B) go out through exit C.
   - Since we have already accounted for 300 students going through A and 420 students going through B, the number of students leaving through C is:
     \(280 - (300 + 420)\)
   
7. **Calculation for Exit C**:
   - First, add up those who went through A and B:
     \(300 + 420 = 720\)
   - Then subtract from the total to find those who went through C:
     \(280 - 720 = -440\)

Since there cannot be negative numbers of students, it indicates that no one exited through exit C; all students either left through A or B.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 0.

The final answer is:
{The final answer is} 0<|im_end|>","The number of students who went out through exit A is 30/100%1000 = 300 students.

3/5 of the students used exit B, a total of 3/5*700 = <<3/5*700=420>>420 students.
If 420 of the remaining students who didn't use exit A used exit B, the number who used exit C is 700-420 = 280 students.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
   
2. **Express the Number of Candies Each Person Has in Terms of \( R \):**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 \) candies.
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert, so John has \( 2R \) candies.
   - We know that John has 54 candies, so we can set up an equation to find \( R \):
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]
   
3. **Solve for \( R \):**
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

4. **Find the Number of Candies Each Person Has:**
   - Robert has \( R = 27 \) candies.
   - James has \( R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.
   - John has \( 2R = 2 \times 27 = 54 \) candies (already given).

5. **Determine How Many More Candies John Has Than James:**
   - The difference between John's and James' candies is:
     \[
     54 - 33 = 21

To determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Initial Count**:
   - Dolly initially has 2 books.
   - Pandora initially has 1 book.

2. **Reading Each Others' Books**:
   - When Dolly reads Pandora's book, it counts towards Dolly's total but not towards Pandora's because reading someone else's book doesn't count in that person's collection.
   - Similarly, when Pandora reads Dolly's book, it also counts towards Dolly's total but not towards Pandora's.

3. **Calculating Total Books Read**:
   - Since Dolly only reads her own books (no other books), she will have added all her books to her count.
   - Pandora reads exactly one book from Dolly's collection, so this adds 1 book to Pandora's count.

4. **Final Count**:
   - After reading each others' books, Dolly will still have 2 books (her initial + the one from Pandora).
   - Pandora will have 1 book (the one she read from Dolly) plus 1 more book (from Dolly's collection).

Therefore, the final number of books they collectively read by the end is: 3 books (Dolly's initial 2 + 1 additional book from Pandora).<|im_end|>","There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Mike has 5 pen pals.
   - Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week.
   
   \[
   \text{Total letters sent per week} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ letters}
   \]

2. **Determine how much time Mike spends on writing these letters:**
   - Mike writes 5 pages per letter.
   - Each page is 5 pages long.
   
   \[
   \text{Pages written per letter} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ pages}
   \]
   
3. **Find out how many pages Mike writes in one hour:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - It takes him 6 minutes to write one page.
   
   \[
   \text{Minutes spent per page} = 60 \div 6 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   
4. **Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes in one week:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week.
   
   \[
   \text{Pages written in one week} = 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ pages}
   \]

5. **Find out how many hours Mike spends writing in one week:**
   - We know he writes 25 pages per letter and 5 pages per letter.
   
   \[
   \text{Hours spent per page} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   - So, for 70 pages:

   \[
   \text{Hours spent writing in one week} = \frac{70 \times 10}{60} = \frac{700}{60} = 11.67 \text{ hours}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total monthly minutes used**

- Jason gets 1000 minutes per month.
- He uses 15 minutes for every call he makes with his boss.

Let's denote ""x"" as the number of times he calls his boss in a month. Therefore, his total minutes spent on calls would be \(15 \times x\).

Since there are 30 days in the month, we can express the total minutes used as:
\[ Total\_minutes = 1000 + (15 \times x) \]

Given that Jason used 300 extra minutes from his allocated 1000 minutes, we know that:
\[ 300 = 1000 - Total\_minutes \]

Substituting the expression for total minutes into the equation above gives us:
\[ 300 = 1000 - (1000 + (15 \times x)) \]
\[ 300 = 800 - (15 \times x) \]

Now, let's solve for ""x"":
\[ 15 \times x = 800 - 300 \]
\[ 15 \times x = 500 \]
\[ x = \frac{500}{15} \]
\[ x = 33.33 \]

So, Jason makes approximately 34 calls with his boss (rounding up since partial calls don't make sense here). 

**Step 2: Calculate total minutes used on calls**

Each call lasts 15 minutes, so:
\[ Total\_call\_minutes = 34 \times 15 \]
\[ Total\_call\_minutes = 510 \]

**Step 3: Calculate remaining minutes**

We subtract the total minutes used on calls from the monthly allowance:
\[ Remaining\_minutes = 1000 - 510 \]
\[ Remaining\_minutes = 490 \]

Therefore, after using 300 extra minutes, Jason has **490 minutes** left for other purposes during the month.<|im_end|>","First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial amount of fries:**
   Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Kyle takes fries:**
   Kyle takes 5 fries.
   
   Current total for Griffin after Kyle:
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Billy takes fries:**
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   
   Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
   \]
   
   Current total for Griffin after Billy:
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Ginger gives fries to Griffin:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gives to Griffin.
   
   After receiving these fries, Griffin has:
   \[
   9 + x = 27 \text{ fries}
   \]
   
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 27 - 9 = 18 \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Colby takes fries:**
   Colby takes 3 fewer fries than Kyle originally took (which was 5 fries).
   
   So, Colby takes:
   \[
   5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Final check:**
   We need to ensure that Griffin ends up with 27 fries. Let's verify:
   - Griffin started with 24 fries.
   - Kyle took 5 fries.
   - Billy took 10 fries.
   - Ginger gave 18 fries.
   - Colby took 2 fries.

   Total given away or taken away should equal the initial amount minus the final amount:
   \[
   24 - (5 + 10 + 18 + 2) = 24 - 35 = -11 \neq 0
   \]

It appears there might have been an error in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

- Griffin starts with 24 fries.
- Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving 19 fries.
- Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so he takes 10 fries, leaving 9 fries.
- Ginger gives enough fries such that Griffin ends up with 27 fries. This means Ginger must have given 18 fries initially, which matches our previous solution.

Given this, we realize the correct answer should indeed be 18 fries, not 19 as previously calculated. The mistake was in the verification process.

**Correct Answer:**
\[
\boxed{18}
\]<|im_end|>","Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them.
Billy took twice as many as Kyle, removing 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 fries.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, removing 5-3=<<5-3=2>>2 fries.
If we let X be the number of fries given to Griffin by Ginger, then 24-5-10-2+x=27
Thus, Ginger had given Griffin x=20 fries

1. **Determine the total number of snails in both aquariums**.
2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails**.
3. **Use that difference to find out how many fish are in each aquarium**.

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of snails in both aquariums

- Aquarium A has 4 snails.
- Aquarium B has 32 snails.

So, the total number of snails in both aquariums combined is:
\[ 4 + 32 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the difference in the number of snails

The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

This means there is a difference of 28 snails between the two aquariums.

### Step 3: Use the difference to find out how many fish are in each aquarium

We are told that the difference in the number of snails (which is 28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let \( F \) represent the number of fish in each aquarium.

Given that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish in each aquarium, we can write:
\[ 2F = 28 \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{2} \]
\[ F = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup.
- Each day, the makeup artist spends 6 hours doing makeup.
- Jean needs it done 4 times a week.
- Therefore, the total number of hours spent per week is \( 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \).

### Step 2: Determine the cost per week without any discount.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- Therefore, the weekly cost without any discount is \( 24 \text{ hours/week} \times \$250/\text{hour} = \$6,000/\text{week} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost before applying the discount.
- The total cost before any discounts is $6,000 per week.

### Step 4: Apply the 10% discount after completing the movie.
- A 10% discount means that Jean pays 90% of the original cost.
- The discounted cost can be calculated as \( 0.9 \times \$6,000/\text{week} = \$5,400/\text{week} \).

### Final Answer:
Jean paid a total of $5,400 after the discount. {The final answer is} $5,400.<|im_end|>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

   - Chef bought 4 bags.
   - Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 4 \times 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

3. **Determine the total cost:**
   - The price per pound of onions is $1.50.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total weight} \times \text{Price per pound}
   \]
   
4. **Substitute the values into the equation:**

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50 \text{/pound}
\]

5. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
200 \times 1.50 = 300
\]

6. **Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\$300}
\]<|im_end|>","A bag of onions cost $1.50 x 50 = $<<1.5*50=75>>75.
Therefore, the chef spent $75 x 4 = $<<75*4=300>>300 for the four bags of onions.

                    question:
                    On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and ? 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many : more calories did Sue consume than her sister?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies Sue and her sister ate on each day, calculate the total calories consumed by both, and then find the difference in calories between them.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cookies eaten on Monday
- **Sue's cookies on Monday**: Sue eats 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
  - Let \( S \) be the number of cookies her sister eats on Monday.
  - Therefore, Sue eats \( 4S \) cookies.
  
- **Sister's cookies on Monday**: The sister eats 5 cookies.
  
### Step 2: Determine the number of cookies eaten on Tuesday
- **Sue's cookies on Tuesday**: Sue eats twice as many cookies as her sister.
  - Let \( S \) again be the number of cookies her sister eats on Tuesday.
  - Therefore, Sue eats \( 2S \) cookies.
  
- **Sister's cookies on Tuesday**: The sister eats 13 cookies.
  
### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten over two days
- **Total cookies for Sue**:
  - Monday: \( 4S \)
  - Tuesday: \( 2S \)
  - Total for Sue: \( 4S + 2S = 6S \)

- **Total cookies for the sister**:
  - Monday: \( 5 \)
  - Tuesday: \( 13 \)
  - Total for the sister: \( 5 + 13 = 18 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the total calories consumed by both
- Each cookie contains 200 calories.
- **Calories for Sue**:
  - Calories from Monday’s cookies: \( (4S) \times 200 \)
  - Calories from Tuesday’s cookies: \( (2S) \times 200 \)
  - Total for Sue: \( 800S + 400S = 1200S \)

- **Calories for the sister**:
  - Calories from Monday’s cookies: \( 5 \times 200 \)
  - Calories from Tuesday’s cookies: \( 13 \times 200 \)
  - Total for the sister: \( 1000 + 2600 = 3600 \)

### Step 5: Find the difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister
- **Difference in calories**:
  - Difference: \( 1200S - 3600 \)

Since we don't know the value of \( S \), let's express the final answer in terms of \( S \).

\[
\text{The final answer is} \boxed{\text{1200S}}

                    question:
                    Each class in a school has 20 students. There are 3 classes. The school as a whole is 50% boys and ? 50% girls. The , first , class has 15 girls. The second ; class has ! 12 girls. How many boys ; are . in the third class?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.
- Each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes.

Total number of students = Number of classes × Students per class
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys and girls in the entire school.
- School is 50% boys and 50% girls.
- Total number of students = 60.

Number of boys in the school = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 60 \)
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

Similarly,
Number of girls in the school = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 60 \)
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \]

So far, we have accounted for all students (boys and girls).

### Step 3: Find out how many girls there are in each individual class.
- First class has 15 girls.
- Second class has 12 girls.

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining girls after accounting for the first two classes.
- Remaining girls after the first class = 15 - 12 = 3 girls.
- Remaining girls after the second class = 3 - 12 = -9 (which doesn't make sense, so let's correct this).
- Correct calculation: Remaining girls after both classes = 12 + 3 = 15 girls.

Now, since we know the total number of girls should be equal to the number of girls in the school, which is 30, but we've calculated only 15 girls from both classes combined, it indicates an error or inconsistency in the given information. However, assuming the problem allows such a scenario where some girls might not be counted properly, we'll continue with the calculations based on the given data.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.
- We already know that the total number of students is 60.
- The number of girls in the third class must be 18 (since 60 - 15 (first class) - 12 (second class) = 18).

Since the third class has 20 students in total, the number of boys in the third class would be:
\[ \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 - 18 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is **2**.

However, please note that this solution assumes an unusual distribution of gender within the classes that could lead to discrepancies in the provided numbers. If the actual numbers differ significantly, further clarification may be needed to adjust our calculations accordingly.<|im_end|>","The school has 60 students because 3 x 20 = <<3*20=60>>60

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **First Night:**
   - Rick kills ten wolves.
   - Rick kills fifteen cougars.

2. **Second Night:**
   - Rick kills three times as many wolves as cougars from the first night.
     - Number of wolves = 3 × number of cougars from the first night
     - Number of wolves = 3 × 15 = 45 wolves

   - Rick kills three fewer cougars than the previous night.
     - Number of cougars = 15 - 3 = 12 cougars

3. **Calculate Total Animals Killed on Second Night:**
   - Wolves: 45
   - Cougars: 12
   - Total animals = 45 + 12 = 57 animals

Now, let's sum up all the animals killed over both nights:

- First night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Second night: 45 wolves + 12 cougars = 57 animals

Total number of animals killed in total = 25 (first night) + 57 (second night)

2. **Determine the total distance traveled**:
   - The elevator moves Bill up to an unknown number of floors.
   - This movement is described as ""equal to 4 times, his starting floor, plus 6.""

3. **Calculate the total floor change**:
   - Since the total floor change equals 4 times the starting floor plus 6,
     \[
     \text{Total floor change} = 4 \times (\text{Starting floor}) + 6
     \]
   - Substituting the starting floor (3):

   - Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each.
   - So, the initial total number of cows = \(10 \times 20 = 200\).
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows.

2. **Calculate the total number of cows after the purchase:**
   - After buying 40 more cows, the total number of cows becomes \(200 + 40 = 240\).

3. **Divide the total number of cows equally among the 20 stalls:**
   - To find out how many cows are put into each stall, divide the total number of cows (240) by the number of stalls (20):
     \[
     \frac{240}{20} = 12
     \]
   - Each stall gets 12 cows.

4. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls:**
   - Since each stall has 12 cows, for 8 stalls, the total number of cows would be:

   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   \[
   100 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01/\text{penny} = \$1.00

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   \[

Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the redwood:**
   - We know that each 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds.
   - The redwood is 200 feet tall.

   To find out how many sections there are in 200 feet, divide the total height by the length of one section:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Length per section}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

   Now, multiply the number of sections by the weight of one section to get the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}

2. **Determine the amount of wood eaten by termites:**
   - Termites ate 30% of the wood.

   Calculate 30% of the total weight:
   \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the books:**
   - Nancy owes $0.50 per book.
   - She has 8 books.

   \[
   \text{Total cost for books} = 0.50 \times 8 = \$4.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fruits Andrea and Jamal have in total based on the given information.

1. **Identify the number of apples Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples Jamal has:**
   - Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can set up an equation.
     \[
     A = J + 8
     \]
     where \(A\) represents the number of apples Andrea has (52), and \(J\) represents the number of apples Jamal has.
     
     Substituting the known value for \(A\):
     \[
     52 = J + 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \(J\):**
   \[
   J = 52 - 8
   \]
   \[
   J = 44
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of bananas Jamal has:**
   - According to the problem, Jamal has half as many bananas as he has apples.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     B_J = \frac{J}{2}
     \]
     Substituting the value for \(J\):
     \[
     B_J = \frac{44}{2}
     \]
     \[
     B_J = 22
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of bananas Andrea has:**
   - The problem states that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     B_A = \frac{B_J}{2}
     \]
     Substituting the value for \(B_J\):
     \[
     B_A = \frac{22}{2}
     \]
     \[
     B_A = 11
     \]

6. **Summarize the total number of fruits:**
   - Now, add the number of apples and bananas together:
     \[
     Total = A + B_A + B_J
     \]
     Substituting the values calculated:
     \[
     Total = 52 + 11 + 22
     \]
     \[
     Total = 85
     \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is \(\boxed{85}\).<|im_end|>","Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.

Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many cups of flour Carla needs to bake the cookies, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies Carla wants to bake:**
   - Today: 36 cookies
   - Tomorrow: 30 cookies
   - Total cookies = 36 + 30 = 66 cookies

2. **Find out how much flour is required for one cookie:**
   - We know that two cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies.
   - Therefore, for one cookie, the amount of flour needed would be half of what is needed for twelve cookies.

   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{\text{Flour for 12 cookies}}{12}
   \]
   Since two cups are needed for 12 cookies,
   \[
   \text{Flour for 12 cookies} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cups}
   \]
   So, the amount of flour per cookie is:
   \[
   \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{24}{12} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 66 cookies:**
   - If one cookie requires 2 cups of flour, then for 66 cookies, the total amount of flour needed would be:
   \[
   \text{Total flour needed} = 66 \times 2 = 132 \text{ cups}
   \]

Therefore, Carla will need \boxed{132} cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.<|im_end|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.

Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pennies in the stack:**
   - We know there are 9,300 pennies in the cup.
   - The stack contains two-thirds of the pennies from the cup.

2. **Calculate two-thirds of the total pennies:**
   \[
   \text{Number of pennies in the stack} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = 2 \times (9,300 / 3) = 2 \times 3,100 = 6,200
   \]

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Multiply 2 by 3,100 to ensure accuracy:
     \[
     2 \times 3,100 = 6,200
     \]

5. **Convert the number of pennies in the stack to dollars:**
   - Since one penny equals $0.01, multiply the number of pennies by $0.01:
     \[
     6,200 \text{ pennies} \times \$0.01/\text{penny} = \$62
     \]

Thus, the total dollar amount in the stack containing two-thirds of the pennies in the cup is $\boxed{\$62}$.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the property including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.
- The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
- Selling price = $350,000
- Brokerage fee = 5/100 * $350,000 = $17,500

Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.
- The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
- Transfer fee = 12/100 * $350,000 = $42,000

Step 3: Calculate the total price of the house.
- Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
- Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $410,500

Step 4: Compare the total price to Mrs. Cruz's budget.
- Mrs. Cruz's budget = $400,000
- Difference = Total price - Budget
- Difference = $410,500 - $400,000 = $10,500

To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total expenses (transfer fees and brokerage fees).
2. Add the remaining loan amount.
3. Subtract the total expenses from the selling price.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Transfer Fees and Brokerage Fees

- **Transfer Fee**: 3% of the selling price ($400,000)
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = \$12,000 \]

- **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price ($400,000)
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = \$20,000 \]

### Step 2: Total Expenses

Add the transfer fee and the brokerage fee together.
\[ \text{Total Expenses} = \$12,000 + \$20,000 = \$32,000 \]

### Step 3: Remaining Loan Amount

Mr. Tan has already sold the house for $400,000, but he still owes $250,000 on the remaining loan amount.

### Final Calculation

Subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds.
\[ \text{Net Proceeds} = \$400,000 - \$32,000 = \$368,000 \]

Therefore, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house are $\boxed{\$368,000}$.<|im_end|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

   - The next heating increases the temperature from 300°C to 400°C (a 100°C increase).
     - Since it takes 40% longer for this increase, we can determine the additional time required:
       \[
       \text{Additional Time} = 20 \times 0.4 = 8 \text{ minutes}
       \]

3. **Total Time Before Cooking:**
   - Add the initial heating time and the additional time needed at the higher temperature:
     \[
     \text{Total Time Before Cooking} = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Cooking Time Calculation:**
   - The problem states that after warming, cooking takes 5 minutes less than the time to warm up the oil.
     - Therefore, the cooking time is:
       \[
       \text{Cooking Time} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ minutes}
       \]

5. **Total Time from Start to Finished Meal:**
   - Adding the total time before cooking and the cooking time together gives us the total time elapsed:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 28 + 15 = 43 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Conclusion:
After calculating all these steps, we find that the total time passed from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is **43 minutes**.<|im_end|>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

                    question:
                    A real , estate agent has spent $5 on each newspaper ad and spent $75 on each television ad. He bought 50 , newspaper ads : and 15 television ads. , How much did the real estate agent spend on buying all the ads?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of both the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total cost for the newspaper ads:**
   - Each newspaper ad costs $5.
   - The agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = 5 \times 50 = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the television ads:**
   - Each television ad costs $75.
   - The agent bought 15 television ads.
   \[
   \text{Total cost for television ads} = 75 \times 15 = 1125
   \]

3. **Sum the costs from both types of ads:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost for television ads}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 250 + 1125 = 1375
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads.

\[
\boxed{\$1375}
\]<|im_end|>","He spent a total of $5 x 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250 for the newspaper ads.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of balls
We know that the juggler can juggle 16 balls.

### Step 2: Determine the proportion of golf balls in the set
Half of the balls are golf balls.
- Therefore, the number of golf balls = (1/2) * Total number of balls
\[ \text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of golf balls} = 8 \]

### Step 3: Determine the proportion of blue golf balls in the set
Half of the golf balls are blue.
- Therefore, the number of blue golf balls = (1/2) * Number of golf balls
\[ \text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue golf balls} = 4 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is **4**.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many M&M candies Mary has in total. We'll break down the information given and calculate accordingly.

1. **First Bag**: Mary bought one bag containing 300 M&M candies.
   
   \[
   \text{M&M's in Bag 1} = 300
   \]

2. **Second Bag**: The second bag contains 12 more M&M candies than the first bag.

   \[
   \text{M&M's in Bag 2} = 300 + 12 = 312
   \]

3. **Third Bag**: The third bag has a hole in it, meaning it only has half the number of M&M candies as the first bag.

   \[
   \text{M&M's in Bag 3} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

Now, let's add up all the M&M candies from the three bags:

\[
\text{Total M&M's} = \text{Bag 1} + \text{Bag 2} + \text{Bag 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total M&M's} = 300 + 312 + 150

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of windows in one house:**

   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.

   Therefore, for one house:
   \[
   \text{Number of windows per house} = \text{Number of bedrooms} \times \text{Windows per bedroom} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Add the additional windows in each house:**

   - Each house has 4 additional windows that aren't connected to any bedrooms.

   So, for one house:
   \[
   \text{Total windows per house} = \text{Windows from bedrooms} + \text{Additional windows} = 6 + 4 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of windows across both houses:**

   Since there are two houses:
   \[
   \text{Total windows between the houses} = \text{Total windows per house} \times \text{Number of houses}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total windows between the houses} = 10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The total number of windows between the houses is \( \boxed{20} \).<|im_end|>","Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of items purchased**

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry detergent: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Add these amounts together to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cocoa} + \text{Laundry Detergent} + \text{Pasta}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$4.20 + \$9.45 + \$1.35
\]

Now, add them up:

\[
\$4.20 + \$9.45 = \$13.65
\]
\[
\$13.65 + \$1.35 = \$15.00
\]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00.

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid**

The mother pays $20.00 in total.

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Change} = \$20.00 - \$15.00
\]

Perform the subtraction:

\[
\$20.00 - \$15.00 = \$5.00
\]

Therefore, the change given back by the cashier is **$5.00**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{\$5.00}$<|im_end|>","The total shopping cost is $4.2 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $<<4.2+9.45+1.35=15>>15.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of stitches in the entire sweater.
- Total stitches for the sweater = 1800

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches needed for the collar.
- The collar takes 1/10th of the total stitches.
- Number of stitches for the collar = \( \frac{1}{10} \times 1800 = 180 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the number of stitches needed for the rosette.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
- Number of stitches for the rosette = \( 2 \times 180 = 360 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of stitches after accounting for the collar and rosette.
- Remaining stitches after collar and rosette = \( 1800 - (180 + 360) = 1800 - 540 = 1260 \)

### Step 5: Determine how many stitches are used for each sleeve.
- Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches equally between them.
- Number of stitches per sleeve = \( \frac{1260}{2} = 630 \)

Therefore, each sleeve takes **630** stitches.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{630}
\]<|im_end|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.

Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

   - Cost per packet: $40
   - Total cost = 20 * $40 = $800

2. Calculate the cost of the celery seeds:

3. Add the two amounts together to find the total cost:
   - Tomato seeds cost: $800
   - Celery seeds cost: $2400
   - Total cost = $800 + $2400 = $3200

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the number of lines in the first scene:**
   - The first scene has twice as many lines as the song.
   - Since the song has 54 lines, the first scene will have \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.

2. **Calculate how many lines from the first scene are Sean's:**
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's.
   - Therefore, the number of lines Sean needs to memorize from the first scene is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36\).

3. **Calculate the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize:**
   - First scene (with his lines): 36 lines.
   - Second scene (lines that aren't his): Six more lines than the song.
     - Song: 54 lines, so the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
     - Four-fifths of these lines are not Sean's.
     - So, the non-Sean lines in the second scene are \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48\) lines.
     - This means the lines Sean needs to memorize from the second scene are \(60 - 48 = 12\) lines.

4. **Sum up all the lines Sean needs to memorize:**
   - From the first scene: 36 lines.
   - From the second scene: 12 lines.
   - Total lines to memorize: \(36 + 12 = 48\) lines.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter A.
Carly has 80 cards in total.

Given that \(\frac{2}{5}\) of these cards have the letter A:
\[
\text{Number of cards with A} = \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many cards remain after those with A are counted.
Subtract the number of cards with A from the total number of cards:
\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter B.
Given that \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the remaining cards (after counting A) have the letter B:
\[
\text{Number of cards with B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many cards remain after those with A and B are counted.
Subtract the number of cards with A and B from the remaining cards:
\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter C.
Given that \(\frac{5}{8}\) of the remaining cards have the letter C:
\[
\text{Number of cards with C} = \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number of cards that have the letter D.
Since all remaining cards must have either A, B, or C (or none), we subtract the number of cards with A, B, and C from the total number of cards to find those with D:
\[
80 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 80 - 71 = 9

                    ; It takes Matthew 3 minutes . to dig a small , hole : for shrubs and . 10 minutes to dig a large hole ; for : trees.  How many hours will ; it : take . him to dig 30 ; small : holes and 15 . large holes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of hole separately and then sum these times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for small holes
- Time per small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30

\[
\text{Total time for small holes} = \text{Time per small hole} \times \text{Number of small holes}
\]

\[
= 3 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 30 \text{ holes}
\]

\[
= 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for large holes
- Time per large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15

\[
\text{Total time for large holes} = \text{Time per large hole} \times \text{Number of large holes}
\]

\[
= 10 \text{ minutes/hole} \times 15 \text{ holes}
\]

\[
= 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the total time for both types of holes
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Total time for small holes} + \text{Total time for large holes}
\]

\[
= 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
= 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours
\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{60}
\]

\[
= \frac{240}{60}
\]

\[
= 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take Matthew **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.<|im_end|>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes
It takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole and he needs to dig 15 large holes so it will take him 15*10 = <<10*15=150>>150 minutes
It will take 90 minutes to dig the small holes and 150 minutes to dig the large holes for a total of 90+150 = <<90+150=240>>240 minutes
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour and he needs to dig for 240 minutes so that's 240/60 = <<240/60=4>>4 hours

<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the current ages of Mico and Marco.
Let's denote Mico's current age as \( x \) and Marco's current age as \( y \).

According to the problem statement:
\[ x + y = 20 \]

### Step 2: Express the future ages after 10 years.
After 10 years, Mico's age will be \( x + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( y + 10 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total sum of their ages after 10 years.
The total sum of their ages after 10 years will be:
\[ (x + 10) + (y + 10) \]
Simplify the expression:
\[ x + 10 + y + 10 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ x + y + 20 \]

### Step 4: Substitute the given information into the equation.
We already know from the problem statement that \( x + y = 20 \). So we can substitute \( x + y \) with 20:
\[ 20 + 20 \]

### Step 5: Perform the addition.
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Therefore, the sum of their ages after 10 years will be **40**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","There will be an additional 10 (for Mico) + 10 9for Marco) = <<10+10=20>>20 to Mico and Marco's current sum of ages in 10 years.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. In 9 ! years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. How old is Sam now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.

2. **Express Ruby's Age in Terms of Sam's Age:**
   According to the information given, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
   Therefore, Ruby's current age can be represented as \( 6S \).

3. **Set Up the Equation for Their Ages in 9 Years:**
   We know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.
   - Sam's age in 9 years will be \( S + 9 \).
   - Ruby's age in 9 years will be \( 6S + 9 \).

4. **Formulate the Equation Based on the Given Information:**
   According to the statement ""in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam,"" we have:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   First, expand the right side of the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
   
   Next, isolate \( S \) by subtracting \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   6S - 3S + 9 = 27
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]
   
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Sam is currently 6 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is {The final answer is} Sam is 6 years old.<|im_end|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both the popsicles and the ice cream bars that Peter bought.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the popsicles:**
   - Number of popsicles = 20
   - Cost per popsicle = $0.25
   - Total cost for popsicles = Number of popsicles × Cost per popsicle
     \[
     \text{Total cost for popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:**
   - Number of ice cream bars = 4
   - Cost per ice cream bar = $0.50
   - Total cost for ice cream bars = Number of ice cream bars × Cost per ice cream bar
     \[
     \text{Total cost for ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Add the costs together to find the total amount paid:**
   - Total cost for popsicles + Total cost for ice cream bars

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each cobra (including those with 70 spots) has twice as many spots as each mamba.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots on the cobras:**
   - Since each cobra has 70 spots, and there are 40 cobras,
     \[
     \text{Total spots on cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
     \]

3. **Determine the number of spots on one mamba:**
   - Let \( S_m \) be the number of spots on one mamba.
   - According to the problem, each cobra has twice as many spots as each mamba,
     \[
     70 = 2S_m \implies S_m = \frac{70}{2} = 35
     \]
   - Therefore, each mamba also has 35 spots.

4. **Calculate the total number of spots on the mambas:**
   - Since there are 60 mambas,
     \[
     \text{Total spots on mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
     \]

5. **Combine the total spots from both the cobras and the mambas:**
   - Total spots combined = spots on cobras + spots on mambas
     \[
     \text{Total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
     \]

6. **Find half the total number of spots:**
   - Half the total number of spots = \(\frac{4900}{2}\)
     \[
     \text{Half the total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the event**

- **Team Members**: 12
- **Coaches**: 3
- **Guests per Team Member**: 2

Total number of guests = (Number of team members) * (Number of guests per team member)

= 12 * 2 = 24 guests

Now, add up all these numbers to find the total number of people at the event.

Total people = Number of team members + Coaches + Guests

= 12 + 3 + 24 = 40 people

**Step 2: Determine how many pizzas are needed**

Each pizza serves 3 people.

Total number of pizzas required = Total people / People served per pizza

= 40 / 3 ≈ 13.33 pizzas

Since we can't have a fraction of a pizza, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Maddy needs to order **14 pizzas**.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost**

Cost per pizza = $15

Total cost = Number of pizzas * Cost per pizza

= 14 * $15 = $210

So, Maddy will spend **$210** on pizza.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \boxed{210} dollars.<|im_end|>","Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

1. **Determine the total number of topaz gemstones in one necklace:**
   - Each necklace has 8 topaz gemstones.

2. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones in one necklace:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Therefore, the total length of all topaz gemstones on one necklace is \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) inches.

3. **Determine the remaining length for the spaces between the gemstones:**
   - The total length of one necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the total length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the remaining length.
   - Remaining length = Total length - Topaz gemstone length
   - Remaining length = 25 inches - 8 inches = 17 inches.

4. **Calculate the number of spaces between the topaz gemstones:**
   - There is one gap (space) between each pair of adjacent gemstones.
   - To find the number of gaps, divide the remaining length by the length of each gap.
   - Number of gaps = Remaining length / Gap length
   - Number of gaps = 17 inches / (1/4) inches = 68 gaps.

5. **Calculate the total number of beads needed:**
   - Since there are 68 gaps, that means there are 69 spaces between the gemstones (including both ends).
   - Therefore, the total number of beads needed is 69 beads.

6. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads used per necklace:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is one-quarter of an inch long.
   - Divide the total length of the necklace by the length of each sterling silver bead to find the number of beads.
   - Number of beads = Total length of necklace / Length of each bead
   - Number of beads = 25 inches / (1/4) inches = 100 beads.

Therefore, Katerina uses 100 sterling silver beads per necklace.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 100 beads per necklace.<|im_end|>","8 topaz gemstones, at 1 inch per gemstone, contribute a total of 8*1=<<8*1=8>>8 inches to each necklace.

                    question:
                    . Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 . dimes. If : she buys ; a , can of pop for . 55 cents, how many cents ; will , she ? have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has.
2. Determine how much money Kelly spends on the item she wants to buy.
3. Subtract the spent amount from her total to find out how much money she has left.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has
Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so:
- The value of 5 quarters = \( 5 \times 25 \) cents = **125** cents.
- Each dime is worth 10 cents, so:
  - The value of 2 dimes = \( 2 \times 10 \) cents = **20** cents.

Adding both amounts together gives us Kelly's total:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

So far, Kelly has **145 cents** in total.

### Step 2: Determine how much money Kelly spends on the item she wants to buy
The cost of the item she wants to buy is **55 cents**.

### Step 3: Subtract the spent amount from her total to find out how much money she has left
Subtracting the amount spent from her total gives:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, after buying the item, Kelly will have **90 cents** left.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{90}
\]<|im_end|>","Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of rows that contain 5 stars in the 76-star flag.

1. **Identify the pattern**: The flag consists of different numbers of star rows. Specifically, it has:
   - Three rows of 8 stars,
   - Two rows of 6 stars,
   - The remaining stars are in 5-star rows.

2. **Calculate the total number of stars**:
   - Stars in 8-star rows: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
   - Stars in 6-star rows: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.
   
   Total stars so far: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

3. **Determine the number of 5-star rows**:
   - Since the flag has 76 stars in total, subtracting the stars from 8- and 6-star rows gives us the number of 5-star rows: 
     \[
     76 - 36 = 40 \text{ stars}
     \]
   - Each row contains exactly 5 stars, so the number of 5-star rows is:
     \[
     \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ rows}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of rows containing 5 stars is 8. 

{The final answer is} 8 rows.<|im_end|>","The rows of 8 stars have a total of: 3 rows * 8 stars/row = <<3*8=24>>24 stars.
The rows of 6 stars have a total of: 2 rows * 6 stars/row = <<2*6=12>>12 stars.
Including the rows of 8 and 6 stars, we have 24 stars + 12 stars = <<24+12=36>>36 stars.
Now we need to know how many stars are missing, 76 stars - 36 stars = <<76-36=40>>40 stars.
Now we need to distribute the missing stars in rows of 5 stars, 40 stars/5 rows = <<40/5=8>>8 rows of 5 stars.

<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the weight of 80 flagstones:**
   - Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   - Therefore, 80 flagstones would weigh \( 80 \times 75 \) pounds.

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

2. **Calculate the number of trucks needed to transport these flagstones:**
   - The delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
   - We need to find out how many trucks are required to carry 6000 pounds.

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, the calculation shows that we need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 3 trucks.<|im_end|>","The 80 flagstones weight 75 * 80 = <<75*80=6000>>6000 pounds.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the slower car to travel the same distance as the faster car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the speeds of both cars:**
   - The car in the fast lane travels at \( 60 \) miles per hour.
   - The car in the slow lane travels at half that speed, so its speed is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the car in the fast lane:**
   - The car in the fast lane has traveled a total of \( 480 \) miles.

3. **Verify the distances covered by both cars:**
   - Distance covered by the car in the fast lane: \( 480 \) miles.
   - Distance covered by the car in the slow lane should be the same, which confirms our understanding that they have indeed traveled the same distance.

4. **Calculate the time taken by the car in the fast lane to travel \( 480 \) miles:**
   - Time (\( t \)) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}
     \]
   - For the car in the fast lane:
     \[
     t_{\text{fast}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Since both cars travel the same distance, the time taken by the car in the slow lane will also be the same:**
   - Therefore, the time taken by the car in the slow lane is also \( 8 \) hours.

### Final Answer:
The car in the slow lane took \( 8 \) hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane. 

\[
\boxed{8 \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Ali's Medals**:
   - Ali has won 22 medals.

2. **Izzy's Medals**:
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, Izzy's number of medals = 22 (Ali's medals) - 5 = 17 medals.

3. **Total Medals**:
   - Together, Ali and Izzy have 22 (Ali's) + 17 (Izzy's) = 39 medals in total.

4. **Medals per Person**:
   - The statement ""Together they have 10 times less medals"" implies that there were 10 groups of 39 medals.
   - Let \( M \) represent the total number of medals given out for counting.
   - According to the statement, \( M \times 10 = 39 \).

5. **Solve for \( M \)**:
   - To find \( M \), we divide both sides of the equation by 10: 
     \[
     M = \frac{39}{10} = 3.9
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the number of medals must be an integer, we recognize that the statement ""10 times less"" might imply rounding or simplification, but if interpreted literally as ""10 times fewer"", it suggests a very small number of groups rather than a large one. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

   - There are 4 adults and 8 children.
   - The total number of people sharing the chocolate bars is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   - Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars available is \(12 \times 5 = 60\).

2. **Determine how many chocolate bars each adult receives:**
   - Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
   - With 4 adults, the total number of chocolate bars given out is \(4 \times 6 = 24\).

3. **Calculate the remaining chocolate bars after distribution to adults:**
   - Subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total number of chocolate bars.
   - Remaining chocolate bars = \(60 - 24 = 36\).

4. **Divide the remaining chocolate bars equally among the children:**
   - There are 8 children.
   - Each child should receive an equal amount of chocolate bars.
   - Number of chocolate bars per child = \(\frac{36}{8} = 4.5\).

Therefore, each child will get 4.5 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer:** Each child will get 4.5 chocolate bars.<|im_end|>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total time Susan worked on the task.
- Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which gives us a total of 3 hours or 180 minutes.
- She pauses for half an hour (30 minutes) during her work.

Total working time = Total available time - Pause time
= 180 minutes - 30 minutes
= 150 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals within the working time.
We need to find out how many 10-minute intervals fit into the 150-minute work session.

Number of 10-minute intervals = Total working time / Interval length
= 150 minutes / 10 minutes
= 15 intervals

### Step 3: Determine how much Susan earns per interval.
Susan earns $5 per 10-minute interval.

Earnings per interval = Earnings per interval × Number of intervals
= $5 × 15
= $75

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings.
Since there are 15 intervals and each earns $75, we multiply these values together.

Total earnings = Earnings per interval × Number of intervals
= $75 × 15
= $1,125

Therefore, the amount of money Susan earns for the online task is **$1,125**.<|im_end|>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine initial points for each player before the extra points.

- **Mike**: We know he starts with 21 points.
  
- **Jim**: He has 3 fewer points than Mike. So, Jim starts with \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.

- **Tony**: He has twice as many points as Mike. Therefore, Tony starts with \(2 \times 21 = 42\) points.

### Step 2: Calculate the points after the first three rounds.

- **Mike**:
  Since we don't know how many points he gains per round yet, let's assume he gains 5 points per round (a common number that can be adjusted later). 
  So, Mike ends up with \(21 + 5 = 26\) points.

- **Jim**:
  Similarly, assuming he also gains 5 points per round,
  Jim ends up with \(18 + 5 = 23\) points.

- **Tony**:
  Assuming he gains 5 points per round as well,
  Tony ends up with \(42 + 5 = 47\) points.

### Step 3: Adjusting the points based on the condition for the fourth round.

In the fourth round, each player gets one extra point if they exceed 20 points. Let's check their current points:

- **Mike**: \(26 > 20\), so he gets an extra point, making his total \(26 + 1 = 27\) points.

- **Jim**: \(23 < 20\), so he does not get an extra point.

- **Tony**: \(47 > 20\), so he gets an extra point, making his total \(47 + 1 = 48\) points.

### Step 4: Summing up the total points.

- **Mike**: \(27\)
- **Jim**: \(23\)
- **Tony**: \(48\)

Total points for all three players together:
\[27 + 23 + 48 = 98\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total number of points after the extra points has been distributed is **98**.<|im_end|>","After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.

In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

                    question:
                    Will buys 15 oranges. When he gets home, he asks his 2 sons to ? wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, the youngest is half as old as the oldest. How many oranges are left unwashed?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the age of the youngest son.
2. Calculate how many oranges each son will wash based on their ages.
3. Subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges.

Step 1: Determine the age of the youngest son.
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.
\[ \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{\text{Oldest son's age}}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

Step 2: Calculate how many oranges each son will wash.
- Since there are two sons and one son washes all the oranges (as per the instructions), both sons will wash some oranges.
- Let \( x \) be the number of oranges that each son washes.
- Since there are two sons and one washes all the oranges, \( x = 15 \).

Step 3: Subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges.
- Total number of oranges = 15
- Number of oranges washed by the oldest son = 15
- Number of oranges washed by the youngest son = 15
\[ \text{Number of oranges left unwashed} = 15 - (15 + 15) = 15 - 30 = -15 \]

However, since it doesn't make sense for someone to have negative oranges, let's re-evaluate the distribution. Given the instruction ""wash as many oranges as they are years old,"" the correct interpretation should be that each son washes oranges proportional to their age. 

Let's calculate correctly:

- Oldest son: 8 years old -> Washes \( \frac{8}{26} \times 15 \approx 4.7 \) oranges
- Youngest son: 4 years old -> Washes \( \frac{4}{26} \times 15 \approx 2.3 \) oranges

Since you can't wash partial oranges in reality, the calculations above are not practically feasible due to rounding issues. But mathematically speaking, if we assume whole numbers only, then the calculation would be different but still within reasonable limits.

Final Answer: {The final answer is}-15 oranges, meaning no oranges were left unwashed because the total number of oranges was less than or equal to the total number of oranges distributed among them.<|im_end|>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pushups, squats, and dumbbell presses Darren did over the course of the two days.

### Day 1:
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell Presses: 20

Total for Day 1 = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170

### Day 2:
- Pushups: 
\[ \text{Day 1 pushups} + 20 \]
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \]

- Squats:
\[ \text{Day 1 squats} - 10 \]
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

- Dumbbell Presses:
\[ \text{Day 1 dumbbell presses} \times 2 \]
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Total for Day 2 = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200

### Total Count Over Two Days:
Summing up all the activities from both days:

- Pushups: \(170 + 120 = 290\)
- Squats: \(50 + 40 = 90\)
- Dumbbell Presses: \(20 + 40 = 60\)

Total = 290 (pushups) + 90 (squats) + 60 (dumbbell presses) = **340**

Therefore, the final answer is:
The total count of the activities he's done in the two days is {The final answer is}: 340.<|im_end|>","The total count of activities for the first day is 100+50+20 = <<100+50+20=170>>170

He also does 50-10 = <<50-10=40>>40 squats on the second day
For the dumbbell presses, he doubles the number of the first day, which becomes 2*20 = <<2*20=40>>40
The total count for the three activities on the second day is 40+40+120 = <<40+40+120=200>>200
For the two days, his total count for all the three activities is 200+170 = <<200+170=370>>370

<|im_start|>system
To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last if 5 people consume 0.2 kg of rice per meal (lunch + dinner), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day:**
   - Since there are 5 people eating every meal, they collectively consume \( 5 \times 0.2 = 1 \) kg of rice per meal.
   - If they have two meals per day (lunch and dinner), then their combined daily consumption is \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \) kg of rice per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of days the rice will last:**
   - We have a 42 kg bag of rice available.
   - To find out how many days the rice will last, divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption: 
     \[
     \frac{42}{2} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Convert the number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the number of weeks that the rice will last is:
     \[
     \frac{21}{7} = 3 \text{ weeks}
     \]

**Final Answer:** The 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.<|im_end|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.

To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he actually sold and compare it to his target.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the week.
- From Monday to Friday (closed), no sales.
- Saturday: 20 crates
- Sunday: 20 crates
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates

Total sales = 20 + 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 95 crates

Step 2: Compare the actual sales to the target.
Sam's target is 120 crates per week.

Difference = Target - Actual Sales = 120 - 95 = 25 crates

Therefore, Sam was off by 25 crates from his target for the week.

The final answer is: The final answer is 25 crates.<|im_end|>","During the whole week Sam sold 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = <<15+12+18+20=65>>65 crates.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much money the antique desk costs Carmen, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial bid**: Carmen starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Understand the bidding pattern**: Bids increase by $50 each round, and three other people also bid.

3. **Determine the total number of rounds**: There are four rounds (since there were three bidders plus Carmen herself).

4. **Calculate the final bid**: Each person's bid increases by $50 per round. Since there are four rounds, each person will have bid at least one time.

Let's break down the bidding process:

- **Round 1**:
  - Initial bid: $200.
  - Bidder 1: $200 + $50 = $250.
  - Bidder 2: $200 + $50 = $250.
  - Bidder 3: $200 + $50 = $250.
  
  So, after the first round, all three bidders have reached or exceeded the starting price ($250), and the third bidder has surpassed it.

- **Round 2**:
  - All previous bids (starting from $250) are doubled because each bid increments by $50.
  - Therefore, the new prices for each bidder would be: 
    - Bidder 1: $250 * 2 = $500.
    - Bidder 2: $250 * 2 = $500.
    - Bidder 3: $250 * 2 = $500.
    
  After this round, all three bidders are now above their starting bid of $200.

- **Round 3**:
  - Again, all previous bids are doubled again since each bid increments by $50.
  - New prices for each bidder would be:
    - Bidder 1: $500 * 2 = $1000.
    - Bidder 2: $500 * 2 = $1000.
    - Bidder 3: $500 * 2 = $1000.
    
  At this point, all three bidders have crossed over Carmen's starting bid of $200.

Since Carmen ends up winning after these rounds, she must have bid just before the last round where everyone else had already bid more than $200.

Given that the bids double every two rounds and Carmen won immediately upon reaching or exceeding $200, she could not have bid during any of the earlier rounds because no one else had bid yet when she entered the game.

Therefore, Carmen must have bid exactly $200 initially and then matched the highest bid among the three competitors who were already involved in the bidding.

So, let's calculate the total amount spent by Carmen:

- Her initial bid: $200.
- Highest bid by the competing parties: $1000 (after doubling twice).

Thus, Carmen’s total expenditure equals her initial bid plus the highest competitor’s bid:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$200 + \$1000 = \$1200 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$1200}
\]<|im_end|>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

                    John hires a driving service to get him to work . each day.  His work is 30 miles away , and he has to go there and back each day.

<|im_start|>wait
To calculate how much John pays annually for driving services, we need to break down the costs into different components: mileage charges, cost per mile, and the bonus.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Mileage Charges

John drives 60 miles one way (to work) because he travels both ways each day.
\[ \text{Weekly Miles} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ miles/day} \]

Given that the rate is $2 per mile:

\[ \text{Mileage Charge per Week} = 120 \times \$2 = \$240 \]

Since John works 5 days a week:

\[ \text{Total Mileage Charge per Year} = \$240 \times 5 = \$1200 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Cost Per Driver

There are approximately 50 working weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Annual Mileage Charge} = \$1200 \times 50 = \$60000 \]

### Step 3: Add the Bonus

John gives his driver a monthly bonus of $150 per month.

\[ \text{Monthly Bonus} = \$150 \]

So, over the course of 50 weeks:

\[ \text{Total Annual Bonus} = \$150 \times 50 = \$7500 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Annual Cost

Now, sum up all the costs:

- **Total Annual Mileage Charge:** \$60000
- **Total Annual Bonus:** \$7500

\[ \text{Total Annual Driving Costs} = \$60000 + \$7500 = \$67500 \]

Therefore, the total amount John pays annually for driving services is \( \boxed{67500} \).<|im_end|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday.

On Monday:
- Time = 16 minutes

On Sunday:
- Time = 23 minutes

Total time on Monday and Sunday:
\[ \text{Monday} + \text{Sunday} = 16 + 23 = 49 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Determine how much more time Peter needs on Tuesday compared to the combined time from Monday and Sunday.

Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday for twice as long as the combined time from Monday and Sunday.
\[ \text{Goal} = 2 \times (16 + 23) \]
\[ \text{Goal} = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Subtract the total time on Monday and Sunday from the goal to find out how much time Peter needs on Tuesday.

Time needed on Tuesday:
\[ \text{Tuesday} = \text{Goal} - (\text{Monday} + \text{Sunday}) \]
\[ \text{Tuesday} = 98 - 49 = 49 \text{ minutes} \]

### Conclusion:
Peter has to exercise for **49 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.

   - The tabloid consists of 32 pages.
   - Each page has two sides: a front side and a back side.

2. **Folding Process**:
   - Start with one sheet of paper.
   - Fold the paper vertically to create two halves (top and bottom).

3. **Printing Pages**:
   - Page 1 is printed on the left side.
   - Page 2 is printed on the right side.
   - Page 3 is printed on the left side.
   - Page 4 is printed on the right side.
   - This pattern continues for all 32 pages.

4. **Counting the Pieces Used**:
   - Initially, we have one sheet of paper.
   - After folding, we have two sheets (top and bottom).
   - For each page from 3 onwards, we print on both sides (front and back) without needing another sheet because they will already be on different sides after printing.

5. **Calculating Total Sheets Needed**:
   - We start with 1 sheet.
   - We fold this sheet into two sheets.
   - We then print on both sides of these two sheets.
   - Since we only need to print on both sides of each sheet after printing, we do not need an additional sheet for printing.

Therefore, the total number of sheets used is simply 1 sheet initially plus 2 additional sheets during the printing process.

6. **Final Answer**:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Elise made in the second year. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books sold so far.
Elise started with 250 books.

- In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she did in the current year (which is 45).
  
So, in the first year, she sold \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \) books.

Total books sold so far:
\[ 250 + 90 = 340 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining unsold books after the first year.
Since there are currently 50 unsold books, let's subtract those from the total books sold so far.

Remaining books:
\[ 340 - 50 = 290 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of books sold in the second year.
We know that the total number of books sold over all three years is 340.

Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the second year.

From the information given, the sum of books sold in the first and second years equals the total number of books sold so far minus the 50 unsold books.

\[ x + 45 = 340 \]
\[ x = 340 - 45 \]
\[ x = 295 \]

So, Elise sold 295 books in the second year.

### Step 4: Calculate the earnings from the second year.
Each book sells for $20, so the earnings from the second year can be calculated as follows:
\[ 295 \times 20 = 5900 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **$5900**.<|im_end|>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.

The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Earnings
Watson works a 10-hour shift every day for 5 days a week.
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ hours} \]

He earns $10 per hour.
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 50 \times \$10 = \$500 \]

#### Step 2: Determine the Bonus Amount
Watson receives a $300 bonus each week.
\[ \text{Bonus amount} = \$300 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Earnings
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month (considering a typical month has about 4 full weeks),
\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total monthly earnings before bonus} = \$500 \times 4 = \$2000 \]

Adding the bonus,
\[ \text{Total monthly earnings including bonus} = \$2000 + \$300 = \$2300 \]

#### Step 4: Adjust for Performance
If the company performed ""very well"" throughout the month,
the total earnings will be higher than expected because he would have received an additional performance-related bonus.

Given that the company performed very well all month, the total earnings will increase further due to this extra reward.

However, since no specific information is provided regarding any additional bonuses or performance incentives beyond the weekly bonus, we assume the base calculation without considering the performance bonus.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$2300}
\]<|im_end|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

To determine how many people John lost to, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of opponents**: John faced 20 people.
2. **Percentage of wins**: John won 80% of his matches.

First, we calculate the number of wins:
\[ \text{Number of wins} = 20 \times 0.80 \]

Next, we calculate the number of losses:
\[ \text{Number of losses} = 20 - \text{Number of wins} \]

Let's do the calculations step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total number of wins:
\[ 20 \times 0.80 = 16 \]
So, John won 16 matches.

2. Subtract the number of wins from the total number of opponents to find the number of losses:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to **4** people.

To determine how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:**
   - The total number of loaves produced per day is 60.
   - Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
   
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining loaves after the morning sales:**
   - Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total production.

   \[
   \text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening:**
   - Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it would take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Joey's Weight Loss**:
   - Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

2. **Sandy's Requirements**:
   - Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.
   - This means Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds in some number of weeks (let's call this number \( x \)).

3. **Given Time for Sandy**:
   - Sandy has 4 weeks to achieve her goal.

We know from the problem statement that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. Therefore, if Sandy also loses 8 pounds, she should do so within the same time frame (4 weeks).

Now let's calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:

- Since Joey takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, and Sandy has the same requirement (to lose 8 pounds), it follows that it will still take Sandy 4 weeks to reach her goal.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","Joey loses 8 pounds / 4 weeks = <<8/4=2>>2 pounds per week.

                    question:
                    A tub of ice cream : costing $13 is now sold at $11. A packet of milk was : sold at a discount of $0.5. How much will you save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of ! milk?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for buying 2 tubs of ice cream.
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- If it's sold at $11, that means there's a discount.

Let's calculate the discount amount per tub:
\[ \text{Discount per tub} = \text{Original price} - \text{Selling price} \]
\[ \text{Discount per tub} = \$13 - \$11 \]
\[ \text{Discount per tub} = \$2 \]

Now, let's find out how many discounts apply to two tubs:
\[ \text{Total discount on two tubs} = 2 \times \$2 \]
\[ \text{Total discount on two tubs} = \$4 \]

So, the total savings from buying two tubs of ice cream is $4.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for buying 4 packets of milk.
- The original price of one packet of milk is not provided directly, but since it has been sold at a discount of $0.5, we can assume its original price before any discount was applied.

Assuming the original price (before any discount) of one packet of milk is \( P \), then after a $0.5 discount, the selling price becomes:
\[ \text{Selling price} = P - 0.5 \]

Since no specific value for \( P \) is given in the problem, we'll focus on the discount aspect only because it applies to all packets.

### Step 3: Calculate the total discount for four packets of milk.
- The discount for one packet of milk is $0.5.

Thus, the total discount for four packets of milk would be:
\[ \text{Total discount on four packets} = 4 \times \$0.5 \]
\[ \text{Total discount on four packets} = \$2 \]

### Step 4: Combine the savings from both items.
- Savings from buying two tubs of ice cream: $4
- Savings from buying four packets of milk: $2

Total savings = Savings from ice cream + Savings from milk
\[ \text{Total savings} = \$4 + \$2 \]
\[ \text{Total savings} = \$6 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$6}
\]<|im_end|>","The discount for each tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $<<13-11=2>>2.

You will save $4 + $2 = $6 for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

<|im_start|>super
To determine the total number of new limbs a person would grow after fifteen days from consuming the Lots-of-Limbs Serum, we need to consider the growth rate for both arms and legs separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of arms grown over time.
- **Arm Growth Rate**: Every 3 days, one additional arm grows.
  
  - Number of 3-day periods in 15 days = \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \) periods.
  
  - Therefore, the number of arms grown after 15 days = \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) arms.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of legs grown over time.
- **Leg Growth Rate**: Every 5 days, one additional leg grows.
  
  - Number of 5-day periods in 15 days = \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) periods.
  
  - Therefore, the number of legs grown after 15 days = \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) legs.

### Step 3: Sum up the total number of limbs grown.
- Total number of arms grown + Total number of legs grown = \( 5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} \).

\[ 
\text{Total number of limbs grown} = 5 + 3 = 8 
\]

### Conclusion:
After fifteen days, the person will have grown a total of 8 new limbs due to consuming the Lots-of-Limbs Serum.

**The final answer is:** 8<|im_end|>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the suitcases.
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the flight ticket.
- The cost of the flight ticket is given as $700 more than five times the cost of one business suit.
\[ \text{Cost of one business suit} = \$100 \]
\[ \text{Cost of five business suits} = 5 \times 100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the flight ticket} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total expenses so far.
\[ \text{Total expenses (business suits + suitcases + flight)} = 600 + 150 + 1200 = \$1950 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the savings from the total expenses.
- Theo wants to save $2000, but we need to find out how much he actually spends.
\[ \text{Remaining budget after saving} = 6000 - 2000 = \$4000 \]

### Step 6: Deduct the remaining budget from the total expenses to find out how much he can spend on gifts.
\[ \text{Amount left for gifts} = 4000 - 1950 = \$2050 \]

### Conclusion:
So, Theo has to spend $2050 on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of people in the family**:
   - There are 3 people who eat three eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten by these 3 people per day**:
   - Each person eats 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, the total for one person = \( 3 \) eggs/person/day.
   - For 3 people: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) eggs/day.

3. **Determine the number of days in a week**:
   - There are 7 days in a week.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by all family members in a week**:
   - The 3 people together eat 9 eggs per day.
   - Over 7 days: \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) eggs/week.

5. **Identify the remaining people who eat less than 3 eggs each day**:
   - Since there are only 3 people eating 3 eggs each day, no other group exists to eat fewer than 3 eggs.

Therefore, the family consumes 63 eggs in a week.

**Final Answer**: The family will consume **63 eggs** in a week.<|im_end|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
2. The population of Chile was half its current size at that time.
3. Cera is currently 46 years old.

First, we need to determine Noah's age six years ago based on the fact that he was half as old as Cera then. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, she must have been (46 - 6) = 40 years old six years ago. Therefore, Noah would have been half of 40, which means Noah was 20 years old six years ago.

Next, since the population of Chile was half its current size six years ago, and if the population of Chile is 3000 times Noah's age today, we can set up an equation to find the current population of Chile.

Let P be the current population of Chile. We know Noah’s age is 20, so his current age is also 20. According to the problem, the population six years ago was half of the current population, so we can write:

\[ \text{Population six years ago} = \frac{\text{Current Population}}{2} \]

Given that the population six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age (which is 20), we can substitute Noah's age into the equation for the population six years ago:

\[ \text{Population six years ago} = \frac{P}{2} \]

We know that Noah's age six years ago was 20, so:

\[ \text{Population six years ago} = \frac{P}{2} \]

Since the population six years ago was also equal to 3000 times Noah's age:

\[ \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times 20 \]

Now, solving for P:

\[ P = 3000 \times 20 \times 2 \]
\[ P = 120000 \]

Therefore, the population of Chile is now **120,000**.<|im_end|>","If Cera is 46 years old now, she was 46-6 = <<46-6=40>>40 years old six years ago.

If the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah, there were 3000*20 = <<3000*20=60000>>60000 people living in chile.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's define variables:
- \( D \) = Number of players on the defense.
- \( O \) = Number of players on the offense.
- \( S \) = Number of players on the special teams.

We know that the total number of players in the team is 105, so we can write the equation:
\[ D + O + S = 105 \]

According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense:
\[ O = 2D \]

And there is half the number of players on the special teams compared to those on the defense:
\[ S = \frac{1}{2}D \]

Now, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[ D + 2D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]
Convert 3D to a fraction with the same denominator:
\[ \frac{6}{2}D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105 \]
Combine the fractions:
\[ \frac{7}{2}D = 105 \]
Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 105 \times \frac{2}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many people will attend Martha's Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of people initially invited.
2. Adjust for those who couldn't attend due to illness.
3. Adjust for those who had previous commitments.
4. Sum up all attendees.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people initially invited.
Martha invited two families with 6 people each, and three families with \(4!\) (which means \(4 \times 3 = 12\) people).

So, the total number of initial invitations is:
\[ 2 \times 6 + 3 \times 12 = 12 + 36 = 48 \]

### Step 2: Adjust for those who couldn't attend due to illness.
According to the information provided, 8 people couldn't come due to illness. So, subtract 8 from the total number of invitations:
\[ 48 - 8 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Adjust for those who had previous commitments.
It states that one-fourth of those who couldn't come due to illness also had previous commitments. This means half of them did not attend because of previous commitments. Therefore, the number of people who didn't attend due to previous commitments is:
\[ \frac{8}{4} = 2 \]

So, we need to add back these 2 people to our count.

### Final Calculation
Now, let's sum it all up:
- Initially invited: 48
- Subtract those who couldn't come due to illness: 40
- Add back those who couldn't come due to both illnesses and previous commitments: 40 + 2 = 42

Therefore, the total number of people who will attend Martha's party is **42**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of people from 6-person families: 2 families * 6 people/family = <<2*6=12>>12 people

Add those two numbers to find the total number of people Martha invited: 12 people + 12 people = <<12+12=24>>24 people
Then find the number of people who couldn't come because they were sick: 8 people / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 people

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.
2. Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after receiving more from Johanna.
3. Calculate the total weight of all the marbles.

### Step 1: Determine how many marbles Solomon's father gave him

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend. His father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as Solomon bought from his friend. 

So, let's calculate:
\[ \text{Number of marbles given by father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 \]
\[ = \frac{40}{5} \]
\[ = 8 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has

First, add the marbles Solomon bought from his friend to the marbles given by his father:
\[ \text{Total marbles before adding Johanna's marbles} = 20 + 8 \]
\[ = 28 \]

Next, add the marbles Johanna added to the store (which already contained 50 marbles):
\[ \text{Total marbles now} = 28 + 50 \]
\[ = 78 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of all the marbles

Each marble weighs 2 kg. So, the total weight is calculated by multiplying the total number of marbles by the weight per marble:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 \]
\[ = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
{The final answer is} 156 kg.<|im_end|>","After buying twenty marbles from his friend Johanna, Solomon had 20+50 = <<20+50=70>>70 marbles.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool**
- The pool has dimensions: 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep.
- The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is what our pool is shaped like) is given by:
\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

**Step 2: Perform the multiplication**
\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 \]
First, multiply 6 and 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]
Then, multiply the result by 5:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is **120 cubic feet**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost to fill the pool**
- We know that filling the pool costs $0.1 per cubic foot.
- To find out the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per Cubic Foot} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times \$0.1 \]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication**
\[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is **$12**.

To solve this problem, we need to carefully break down the information provided and translate it into equations that can be solved.

Let's denote:
- \( B \) as the number of boys in the classroom.
- \( G \) as the number of girls in the classroom.
- \( N \) as the number of non-gendered children (which includes both boys and girls).

Given:
1. The number of boys (\(B\)) is 30.
2. The number of girls (\(G\)) is 3 times the number of boys.
3. The number of non-gendered children (\(N\)) is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys.

First, let's express these relationships mathematically:

From the second point:
\[ G = 3 \times B \]

Since \( B = 30 \):
\[ G = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, from the third point:
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times B \]
Substituting \( B = 30 \):
\[ N = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, the total number of children in the classroom is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
\[ T_{children} = B + G \]

Substitute the values for \( B \) and \( G \):
\[ T_{children} = 30 + 90 = 120 \]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given ratio**: 
   The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.

2. **Understand the relationship**:
   - For every 1 pole, there are 3 wires (as per the ratio).

3. **Given information**:
   - Total number of electric wires = 45.

4. **Determine the number of poles based on the ratio**:
   Since for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires, we can set up a proportion to find the number of poles:
   
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of Poles}}{\text{Number of Wires}} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of poles. Then:
   
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = \frac{1}{3}

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Multiply both sides by 3 to isolate \( x \):
   
   \[
   x = 1 \times 3
   \]
   
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 3.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of people:**
   - There are initially 25 men and 15 women.
   - Total number of people = 25 (men) + 15 (women) = 40 people.

2. **Calculate how many people leave after an hour:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people leave.
   - Number of people who leave = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \).
   - Simplify: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

3. **Find out how many men and women leave:**
   - Since 22 men stay at the party, we need to find out how many women leave.
   - Let the number of women who leave be denoted as \( W \).
   - The remaining number of women should equal the number who leave plus the number that stayed.
   - Therefore, \( 25 - 22 + W = W \).

4. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 3 + W = W \).
   - This simplifies further to \( 3 = 0 \), which is not possible. This indicates an error in our approach since we assumed all men stayed, but the problem states only 22 men stayed. Let’s correct this assumption.
   - Correctly, 22 men stayed, so the number of men who left is \( 22 \).
   - Now, calculate the number of women who left: \( W = 22 \).
   - Since 22 men left, the total number of people who left is \( 22 + 22 = 44 \).
   - Verify: \( 40 - 44 = -4 \), which is incorrect. Re-evaluate the problem statement. If 22 men stayed, then 28 men left, making the total number of people who left \( 28 \). But this contradicts the given information.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Given that 22 men stayed, and 10 people left, the total number of people who left must be \( 22 + 22 = 44 \), but this is impossible because the total number of people is 40.
   - This suggests a misunderstanding. If 22 men stayed, then the number of women who left should be adjusted accordingly.

6. **Correct calculation based on the given information:**
   - If 22 men stayed, then 28 men left.
   - Therefore, the number of women who left is \( 10 \) (since \( 40 - 28 = 12 \)).
   - The number of women left is \( 15 - 12 = 3 \).

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 3.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.

This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.

- We know that a book costs $4.
- According to the information given, a magazine costs half as much as a book.

So, if a book costs $4, then a magazine costs:
\[ \text{Magazine Cost} = \frac{\text{Book Cost}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Magazine Cost} = \frac{4}{2} \]
\[ \text{Magazine Cost} = \$2 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of a pen**
- It is stated that a pen costs $1 less than a magazine.

Given that a magazine costs $2, we can find the cost of a pen:
\[ \text{Pen Cost} = \text{Magazine Cost} - \$1 \]
\[ \text{Pen Cost} = 2 - 1 \]
\[ \text{Pen Cost} = \$1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs **$1**.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of pencils in each box:**
   - We know that Jam has three boxes.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of pencils in one box.

2. **Calculate the total number of pencils in the boxes:**
   - Since there are three boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is \( 3x \).

3. **Include the loose pencils:**
   - The loose pencils add another 2 pencils to the total.
   - Therefore, the total number of pencils in the boxes plus the loose pencils equals 26.
   - So, we have: 
     \[
     3x + 2 = 26
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x = 24
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Each box contains 8 pencils.
   - With three boxes, the total number of pencils in the boxes is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).
   - Adding the 2 loose pencils gives \( 24 + 2 = 26 \), confirming our solution is correct.

6. **Determine the number of pencils Meg has:**
   - Meg has 46 pencils.

7. **Calculate the total number of pencils Jam and Meg together have:**
   - Add the number of pencils in the boxes to the number of pencils Meg has:
     \[
     24 (from \; jam\; boxes) + 46 (Meg\; pencils) = 70
     \]

8. **Determine the number of boxes needed:**
   - There are 70 pencils in total.
   - Each box holds 8 pencils.
   - To find out how many boxes are needed, divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils per box:
     \[
     \frac{70}{8} = 8.75
     \]
   - Since you can't have a fraction of a box, round up to the nearest whole number because even a partial box would still be necessary.

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. 

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is}. 9 boxes.<|im_end|>","There are a total of 26 - 2 = <<26-2=24>>24 pencils in the three boxes.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the coffee becomes weaker due to both the cooling effect from the ice cubes and the addition of cream.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Cooling Effect of Ice Cubes:**
   - Each ice cube reduces the temperature of the coffee by \(13\) degrees.
   - The total number of ice cubes used is \(15\) milliliters.
   
   Therefore, the total reduction in temperature due to the ice cubes can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total temperature decrease} = 15 \times 13 = 195 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. **Weakening Due to Cream Addition:**
   - Adding cream weakens the coffee by an additional \(12\) milliliters.

3. **Combining Both Effects:**
   - We first account for the cooling effect of the ice cubes, which results in a total temperature decrease of \(195\) degrees.
   - Next, add the weakening caused by the cream, resulting in another weakening of \(12\) milliliters.

4. **Final Coffee Strength:**
   - Since the coffee loses strength based on its initial volume (which is not provided), let's assume that the original volume was \(V\) milliliters before any changes occurred.
   - After cooling and adding cream, the coffee will lose a certain percentage of its volume due to these effects.

Since no specific initial volume is given, we cannot calculate the exact amount lost without knowing the initial volume \(V\).

### Final Answer:
Given the information, the coffee becomes weaker due to both the cooling effect from the ice cubes and the addition of cream. However, without knowing the initial volume of the coffee, we cannot provide a numerical value for the final weakened volume. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
{The final answer is} depends on the initial volume of the coffee.<|im_end|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the trading ratio**:
   - For every 2 old records traded, you get 1 new record.
   
2. **Calculating the total number of records traded**:
   - Ralph had 7 new records left after the exchange.

3. **Determining how many groups of exchanges occurred**:
   - Since each group consists of 5 people (as given), we need to determine how many such groups were formed.
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total new records}}{\text{Records per group}} = \frac{7}{\text{New records per group}}
     \]
   - We know that each group involves 5 people trading 2 old records for 1 new record. Therefore, each group will yield 1 new record.
     
4. **Finding the number of groups**:
   - The total number of new records (7) divided by the number of new records per group gives us the number of groups.
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{7}{1} = 7
     \]

5. **Calculating the number of old records traded**:
   - Each group trades 2 old records.
   - Therefore, for 7 groups, the total number of old records traded is:
     \[
     \text{Total old records traded} = \text{Groups} \times \text{Old records per group} = 7 \times 2 = 14
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 14 old records.<|im_end|>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of employees in the company.
We know that the total number of employees is given as 100.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of junior programmers.
Given that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees, we can calculate it as follows:
\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of senior programmers.
Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, the rest must be senior programmers:
\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

### Step 4: Determine the salary for junior programmers.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month.

### Step 5: Determine the salary for senior programmers.
Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore, their salary is:
\[
\text{Salary of senior programmer} = \$2000 + \$400 = \$2400
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers.
\[
\text{Total monthly salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times \$2000 = \$80,000
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers.
\[
\text{Total monthly salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times \$2400 = \$144,000
\]

### Step 8: Add the salaries together to get the total amount paid by the company per month.
\[
\text{Total amount paid per month} = \$80,000 + \$144,000 = \$224,000
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:

Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of people on the bus:**
   - We start with some unknown number \( P \) of people on the bus.

2. **People getting on at the terminal:**
   - People get on the bus at the terminal.
   
3. **People getting off at the first bus stop:**
   - After the first bus stop, 5 more people get off the bus.
   
4. **Number of people remaining after the first stop:**
   - Let's denote the number of people remaining after the first stop as \( R_1 \).
     So, \( R_1 = P - 5 \).

5. **People getting on at the second bus stop:**
   - At the second bus stop, 7 more people get on the bus.
   
6. **Total number of people before the third stop:**
   - The total number of people before the third stop is given as 20.

7. **People getting off at the second stop:**
   - After the second bus stop, 8 more people get off the bus.
   
8. **Final number of people remaining after the second stop:**
   - Let's denote the number of people remaining after the second stop as \( R_2 \).
     So, \( R_2 = (P - 5 + 7) - 8 = P - 6 \).

9. **Equation for the total number of people before the third stop:**
   - The total number of people before the third stop should equal 20.
     Therefore, we have \( P - 6 = 20 \).

10. **Solve for \( P \):**
    - From \( P - 6 = 20 \), we get \( P = 26 \).

Therefore, the number of people who initially got on the bus at the terminal is 26.<|im_end|>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.

1. **Initial number of lollipops**: Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops eaten on the way to school**: Oscar eats 2 lollipops on the way to school.
   - Lollipops remaining: \(24 - 2 = 22\).

3. **Lollipops passed out to friends**: Oscar gives away 14 lollipops to his friends.
   - Lollipops remaining after passing them out: \(22 - 14 = 8\).

4. **Number of times Oscar buys lollipops**: Oscar buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave away to his friends.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the phone to fully recharge from its current state (60% charged) until it reaches 100% charged.

Step 1: Understand the charging rate.
- The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes.

Step 2: Determine the total percentage points needed to fully charge the phone.
- At present, the phone is at 60%. To reach full charge (100%), it needs to gain an additional 40 percentage points (since 100 - 60 = 40).

Step 3: Calculate the time required to achieve these percentage points.
- Since the phone gains 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, for 40 percentage points, the time required would be \(40 \times 3\) minutes.

Step 4: Convert the time from minutes to hours.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so to convert \(40 \times 3\) minutes into hours, divide by 60.

Let's perform the calculation:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
\text{Time in hours} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it will take **2 hours** to fully charge the phone.<|im_end|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Rewards from Previous Trip
- The customer spends $80 in one trip.
- They receive $1 off for every $20 spent.
- To find out how much rewards were earned, we divide the total spending by 20 and then multiply by 1 (since there is $1 off for every $20).

\[
\text{Rewards} = \left(\frac{\$80}{\$20}\right) \times \$1 = 4 \times \$1 = \$4
\]

So, the customer received $4 in rewards from the previous trip.

### Step 2: Apply the Coupons
- The customer spent $43 on this trip.
- They apply a coupon that takes off twice the amount of rewards.

\[
\text{Discounted Price} = \$43 - (2 \times \$4)
\]

Calculate the discount:

\[
\text{Discounted Price} = \$43 - \$8 = \$35

<|im_start|>system
To determine which job offers a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs and compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual earnings from Job A

- **Hourly wage**: $15/hour
- **Number of hours per year**: 2000 hours/year

\[ \text{Annual Earnings} = \$15 \times 2000 = \$30,000 \]

### Step 2: Apply the state's tax rate to Job A

- **State tax rate**: 20%
  
\[ \text{Tax Amount from State Tax} = \$30,000 \times 0.20 = \$6,000 \]

\[ \text{Net Pay from Job A} = \$30,000 - \$6,000 = \$24,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the annual earnings from Job B

- **Total Annual Income**: $42,000
- **Property Tax**: $6,000

\[ \text{Income After Property Tax} = \$42,000 - \$6,000 = \$36,000 \]

### Step 4: Apply the state's tax rate to Job B

- **State tax rate**: 10%

\[ \text{Tax Amount from State Tax} = \$36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600 \]

\[ \text{Net Pay from Job B} = \$36,000 - \$3,600 = \$32,400 \]

### Step 5: Compare the net pay rates

- **Net Pay Rate from Job A**:

\[ \text{Net Pay Rate (Job A)} = \frac{\$24,000}{\$30,000} = 0.80 \]

- **Net Pay Rate from Job B**:

\[ \text{Net Pay Rate (Job B)} = \frac{\$32,400}{\$42,000} \approx 0.7786 \]

### Conclusion

Job A has a higher net pay rate than Job B. To find out how much more money Nick would make at the job with a higher net pay rate, subtract the net pay rate of Job B from Job A:

\[ \text{Additional Net Pay Difference} = 0.80 - 0.7786 \approx 0.0214 \]

Therefore, Nick would make approximately \( \$0.0214 \) or about 2.14 cents more per dollar worked at the job with a higher net pay rate compared to the other job.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of ruined castles.
2. Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Let's start with step 1: determining the total number of ruined castles.

We know that 40% of all castles in Scotland are ruins. Given that there are 220 castles in Scotland, we can calculate the number of ruined castles as follows:

Total castles * Percentage of castles as ruins = Number of ruined castles
220 * 0.40 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, let's move on to step 2: calculating the number of unmanned ruined castles.

Half of the ruined castles are unmanned. Therefore:

Number of unmanned ruined castles = Number of ruined castles / 2
= 88 / 2
= 44

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Final answer:
The final answer is: The number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is **44**.<|im_end|>","Ruins:220(.40)=88

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost difference between the two offers, we need to calculate the total cost for each option and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer

- **Advance Payment**: $1,350
- **Monthly Installments**: 6 payments of $350 each

First, calculate the total amount paid in monthly installments:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Payments} = 6 \times \$350 \]

\[
= \$2,100
\]

Now, add the advance payment to the total monthly payments:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Furniture United)} = \$1,350 + \$2,100
\]

\[
= \$3,450
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer

- **Advance Payment**: $1,100
- **Monthly Installments**: 9 payments of $250 each

First, calculate the total amount paid in monthly installments:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Payments} = 9 \times \$250 \]

\[
= \$2,250
\]

Now, add the advance payment to the total monthly payments:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Cozy Homes)} = \$1,100 + \$2,250
\]

\[
= \$3,350
\]

### Step 3: Determine the cost difference

Subtract the total cost of Cozy Homes from the total cost of Furniture United:

\[
\text{Cost Difference} = \$3,450 - \$3,350
\]

\[
= \$100
\]

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is {The final answer is} $100.<|im_end|>","Furniture United's offer is 1,350 + (6 *350) = $<<1350+(6*350)=3450>>3,450
Cozy Homes's offer is 1,100 + (9 * 250) = $<<1100+9*250=3350>>3,350
The difference is 3,450 – 3,350 = $<<3450-3350=100>>100

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of guns.**
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ (Richard) has 5 guns.

Total number of guns = DJ's guns + Nick's guns + RJ's guns
= 8 + 10 + 5
= 23 guns

**Step 2: Calculate the average number of guns per person.**
Since there are 4 people sharing these guns, we divide the total number of guns by 4.

Average number of guns per person = Total number of guns / Number of people
= 23 / 4
≈ 5.75 guns

**Step 3: Interpret the result.**
Each person would get approximately 5.75 guns if they share equally.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 5.75 guns.<|im_end|>","The total number of guns is 8+10+1+5=<<8+10+1+5=24>>24 guns.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers.
- We know that Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
- To find out how much sugar he needs for 8 batches, we multiply the amount of sugar per batch by 8.

\[ \text{Sugar for 8 batches of suckers} = 30 \times 8 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 30 \times 8 = 240 \]

So, Mason needs **240 ounces** of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.
- We know that Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.

### Step 3: Add the amounts from Step 1 and Step 2.
- Now, we add the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers to the sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge.

\[ \text{Total sugar needed} = 240 + 70 \]

Let's do the addition:

\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \]

Therefore, Mason needs **310 ounces** of sugar in total to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 310 \text{ ounces}}

                <|im_end|>

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial total cost.
2. Determine the new price after the increase.
3. Calculate the new total value after the decrease.
4. Add up the values from both years.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Total Cost
Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.

\[ \text{Initial Total Cost} = 8 \times 8 = \$64 \]

### Step 2: Determine the New Price After the Increase
The stock price increases by 50%.

\[ \text{Increase Amount} = 8 \times 0.50 = \$4 \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 8 + 4 = \$12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the New Total Value After the Decrease
After the increase, the stock price becomes $12 per share. Maria holds the stock for two years.

First year increase (no change):
- Maria sells the shares at $12 each.
- Number of shares sold = 8
- Revenue from selling = \(8 \times 12 = \$96\)

Second year decrease (25% decrease):
- Stock price decreases by 25%, so the new price is \(12 \times 0.75 = \$9\).
- Number of shares held remains 8.

Value of remaining shares:
- Selling price per share = $9
- Total value of remaining shares = \(8 \times 9 = \$72\)

### Step 4: Add Up the Values From Both Years
Revenue from selling the shares in the first year = $96
Value of remaining shares after the second year = $72

Final value of all Maria's shares = \(96 + 72 = \$168\)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

Add that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96
Then multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24
Then subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72

   - Therefore, Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.

3. Find out how many hot dogs John ate.
   - John ate half the amount that Thomas ate.
   - So, John ate \(6 / 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

4. Calculate how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the first two groups.
Let \( y \) be the number of students in the third group (the smallest).

Given:
- There are three groups in total.
- The total number of students is 200.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
Since there are three groups and their combined total must equal 200, we can write:

\[ 2x + y = 200 \]

### Step 3: Express y in Terms of x
From the equation above, we express \( y \) as follows:

\[ y = 200 - 2x \]

### Step 4: Use the Condition for the Third Group
We know that the third group has 10 fewer students than either of the others. Therefore, we can set up an inequality based on this condition:

\[ y < x \]
\[ y < x - 10 \]

Substitute \( y = 200 - 2x \) into these inequalities:

For the first inequality:
\[ 200 - 2x < x \]

Simplify this inequality:

\[ 200 < 3x \]
\[ x > \frac{200}{3} \]
\[ x > 66.67 \]

For the second inequality:
\[ 200 - 2x < x - 10 \]

Simplify this inequality:

\[ 210 < 3x \]
\[ x > 70 \]

Since both conditions give us the same value for \( x \), we conclude that:

\[ x > 70 \]

### Step 5: Solve for y
Now substitute \( x = 80 \) back into the expression for \( y \):

\[ y = 200 - 2(80) \]
\[ y = 200 - 160 \]
\[ y = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is **40**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens.
   Let \( K \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know there are 60 total animals.
     Therefore, we can write: 
       \[
       C + K = 60
       \]
   
   - We also know that Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows.
     This gives us:
       \[
       C = 2K
       \]

3. **Solve for One Variable in Terms of Another:**
   Substitute \( C = 2K \) into the first equation:
     \[
     2K + K = 60
     \]
     
   Simplify:
     \[
     3K = 60
     \]
     
   Solve for \( K \):
     \[
     K = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   Using \( C = 2K \), substitute \( K = 20 \):
     \[
     C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   - Each chicken has 2 legs.
   - Each cow has 4 legs.
   
   Calculate total legs from chickens:
     \[
     \text{Chickens' legs} = 40 \times 2 = 80
     \]
   
   Calculate total legs from cows:
     \[
     \text{Cows' legs} = 20 \times 4 = 80
     \]
   
   Add both totals to get the combined total number of legs:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 = 160

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the weights of each animal based on the given information.

We know that:
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- It is 20 pounds more than the red bird.

Let \( R \) represent the weight of the red bird in pounds. Therefore:
\[ 50 = R + 20 \]
Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 50 - 20 \]
\[ R = 30 \]

So, the red bird weighs 30 pounds.

Next, we need to find the weights of the other animals:
- Blue Beetle (B): Same weight as the pink frog.
- Green Toad (G): 10 pounds less than the blue beetle.
- Yellow Snake (Y): 10 pounds less than the red bird.

Given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can deduce:
- Blue Beetle = 50 pounds.
- Green Toad = \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) pounds.
- Yellow Snake = \( 30 - 10 = 20 \) pounds.

Now we have all the weights:
- Pink Frog = 50 pounds.
- Blue Beetle = 50 pounds.
- Green Toad = 40 pounds.
- Yellow Snake = 20 pounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the container.

The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

### Step 3: Add up the weights of all the animals inside the container.

Total weight = Weight of the container + Total weight of the animals inside the container

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 20 \]

Perform the addition:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 + 50 + 50 + 40 + 20 = 180 \]

Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is **180 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the initial gift:**
   - Laurel receives 24 outfits from her friend.
   - She has 0 remaining needed outfits.

2. **Calculating the total number of outfits after receiving gifts at the baby shower:**
   - Laurel receives twice the amount of new baby outfits as she had before.
   - Since she already had 0 outfits, doubling that gives her \(2 \times 0 = 0\) more outfits.
   - Therefore, the total number of outfits she has now is \(24 + 0 = 24\).

3. **Considering the additional gift from Laurel's mom:**
   - Laurel's mom gifts her an additional 15 baby outfits.

4. **Adding the additional gift to her current total:**
   - Adding 15 more outfits to her existing 24 outfits gives her \(24 + 15 = 39\) outfits in total.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 39 outfits.<|im_end|>","Her friend gave her 24 outfits and she received twice as many at the baby shower so she received 2*24 = 48 baby outfits

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the additional distance Tyson would run per day if he follows the coach's advice.

Tyson currently runs 5000 meters per day.
His coach suggests running \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more than he does now.

\[
\text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right)
\]

Calculate \(\frac{1}{5}\):

\[
\frac{1}{5} = 0.2
\]

Now add this to 1:

\[
1 + 0.2 = 1.2
\]

So, the coach suggests he should run \(1.2\) times more:

\[
\text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times 1.2 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new daily distance after applying the coach's advice.

Add the additional distance to the original distance:

\[
\text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 6000 = 11000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of days in June.

June has 30 days.

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance Tyson covers in June.

Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June:

\[
\text{Total distance in June} = 11000 \times 30 = 330000 \text{ meters}
\]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covers in June is:

\[
\boxed{330000 \text{ meters}}
\]<|im_end|>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, given that Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A.

1. **Identify the cost of Juice Box A:**
   - Juice Box A costs $4.

2. **Calculate the cost of Juice Box B:**
   - Juice Box B costs $5 more than Juice Box A.
   - Therefore, the cost of Juice Box B = $4 (cost of Juice Box A) + $5 = $9.

3. **Calculate the cost of Juice Box C:**
   - Juice Box C costs $7 more than Juice Box A.
   - Therefore, the cost of Juice Box C = $4 (cost of Juice Box A) + $7 = $11.

4. **Determine how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B:**
   - The difference in cost between Juice Box C and Juice Box B = $11 (cost of Juice Box C) - $9 (cost of Juice Box B).

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Jenny eats over time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate total cookies per week
Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies per week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.
\[ \text{Total cookies per week} = 36 \]

### Step 2: Calculate cookies for Jenny's son's lunch box
Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunchbox every 5 days.
- There are 7 days in a week.
- She puts cookies into her son's lunchbox 5 times a week.

First, calculate the number of weeks in 5 days:
\[ \text{Number of weeks in 5 days} = \frac{5}{7} \]
Since there are only 7 days in a week, this means she can put cookies into his lunchbox once per week (since \(5 < 7\)).

Now, calculate the total cookies placed into the lunchbox per week:
\[ \text{Cookies per week in lunchbox} = 4 \times \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \]

However, since she can only fit one full bag into the lunchbox within those 5 days, she places all 36 cookies from that bag into the lunchbox. This means:
\[ \text{Cookies placed into lunchbox per week} = 36 \]

### Step 3: Calculate cookies eaten by Jenny’s husband
Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by husband per week} = 1 \times 7 \]

### Step 4: Calculate remaining cookies after accounting for both sons' lunches and husband
Subtract the cookies eaten by her son's lunchbox and her husband from the total weekly cookies bought:
\[ \text{Remaining cookies per week} = 36 - (36 + 36 - 36) \]
Here, she subtracts the cookies used by her son's lunchbox twice but adds back the initial bag of cookies because she only uses one bag per week.

### Step 5: Final calculation
After putting cookies into her son's lunchbox and considering her husband's consumption, we find out how many cookies are left for Jenny to consume.
Let's assume she starts with no cookies at the beginning of the week.

So, let's do the math:

#### Son's Lunchbox Cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies per week in lunchbox} = 4 \times \left(\frac{5}{7}\right) \approx 4 \times 0.714 \approx 2.89 \]
Since she cannot place more than one whole bag in the lunchbox, she gets exactly 36 cookies from the bag.

#### Husband's Consumption:
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by husband per week} = 1 \times 7 = 7 \]

#### Remaining Cookies:
\[ \text{Remaining cookies per week} = 36 - 36 = 0 \]

Therefore, Jenny must have started with cookies before the week began or she had none initially.

### Conclusion:
Jenny needs to start with cookies already available in her possession before the week begins. Given the constraints provided, if she doesn't add any additional cookies during the week, then she will not be able to fulfill the requirement unless she adds them herself or has an excess amount already on hand.

Thus, **the final answer** is that Jenny needs to start with cookies before the week begins or she has extra cookies already. Without further information about whether she added cookies to her stock throughout the week, the conclusion remains that she either needs to begin with cookies or has some in excess.<|im_end|>","The son gets 4 cookies a day for 5 days so he eats 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total cost without any discount.
Davos buys two shirts at $30 each.

\[
\text{Total Cost Without Discount} = 2 \times \$30 = \$60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
A 40% discount on the total cost means we need to calculate 40% of the total cost without the discount.

\[
\text{Discount Amount} = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original total cost.
To find out how much Davos paid after applying the discount:

\[
\text{Final Total Cost} = \$60 - \$24 = \$36
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Davos paid **\$36** for the two shirts after applying the 40% discount.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: $\boxed{\$36}$<|im_end|>","The total price of the 2 shirts is $30 x 2 = $<<30*2=60>>60.

Therefore, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is $60 - $24 = $<<60-24=36>>36.

To solve this problem, we need to compare the revenue from selling tractors versus silos and determine the percentage increase in their earnings.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the daily earnings from tractors:**
   - They sell 10 tractors per day.
   - Each tractor sells for $100.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings (Tractors)} = 10 \times \$100 = \$1000
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily earnings from silos:**
   - They sell 5 silos per day.
   - Each silo sells for $220.
   
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings (Silos)} = 5 \times \$220 = \$1100
   \]

3. **Determine the difference in earnings between tractors and silos:**
   - Daily earnings from silos minus daily earnings from tractors.
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \$1100 - \$1000 = \$100
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in earnings:**
   - Divide the difference by the original amount (daily earnings from tractors).
   
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\%

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Madeline spends on her dog over the course of one year. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Spending
First, let's determine how much Madeline spends on food per week.
- **Food Cost Per Week**: 
  \[
  \$25 \times 4 = \$100
  \]

Next, let's find out how much she spends on treats per month.
- **Treats Cost Per Month**:
  \[
  \$20 \times 4 = \$80
  \]

Finally, let's determine how much she spends on medicine per month.
- **Medicine Cost Per Month**:
  \[
  \$100 \times 4 = \$400
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Spending
Now, let's add up all these expenses to get Madeline’s total monthly spending.
- **Total Monthly Spending**:
  \[
  \$100 (food) + \$80 (treats) + \$400 (medicine) = \$600
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Spending
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 to find the annual spending.
- **Annual Spending**:
  \[
  \$600 \times 12 = \$7200
  \]

### Final Answer
Madeline spends a total of $\boxed{7200}$ dollars on her dog per year.<|im_end|>","Madeline spends$25*4=$<<25*4=100>>100 on food for her dog per month.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

April wants to buy 30 pots for the daisies and twice that amount (60) for the roses.

Total pots needed = 30 (daisies) + 60 (roses)

Total pots needed = 90 pots

**Step 2: Subtract the pots already purchased**

April has already bought 100 pots.

Remaining pots after purchase = Total pots needed - Pots already purchased

Remaining pots after purchase = 90 (needed) - 100 (already purchased)

Remaining pots after purchase = -10 pots

Since we can't have negative pots, it means she doesn't have enough pots to cover all her needs. She would be short by 10 pots.

Therefore, the correct answer should indicate she still lacks 10 pots instead of having any leftover.

Final Answer: The final answer is: **{The final answer is}** -10 pots.<|im_end|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.

                    question:
                    : After Andrea saved some ; money, she then ? spent the rest ; of her money on an ! $11 sweater ! and ? gave her brother , $4. If she had ? $36 . in the beginning, ! how ; much , did Andrea ? save?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information provided about Andrea's spending.

1. **Initial Amount**: We know that if Andrea started with $36, she spent part of it on a $11 sweater and gave $4 to her brother. Let's denote the initial amount as \( A \).

2. **Sweater Purchase**: The total cost of the sweater was $11. So, after buying the sweater, the remaining money would be \( 36 - 11 = 25 \). This means before buying the sweater, Andrea had $25.

3. **Giving Money Away**: After buying the sweater, Andrea gave $4 to her brother. Therefore, before giving any money away, she must have had \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) dollars.

4. **Final Check**: Now, let's check if these calculations match our starting point. If Andrea starts with $36, buys a $11 sweater for $25 (leaving $10), and gives $4 to her brother, she will indeed end up with $10 + $4 = $14. But since the problem states she ended up with $29, there seems to be a discrepancy. 

   However, upon re-evaluating, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The correct approach should consider the total spent plus given away equals the initial amount minus the remaining amount after the purchases.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Start with $36.
   - Subtract the $11 sweater: $36 - $11 = $25.
   - Add back the $4 given to her brother: $25 + $4 = $29.
   
So, Andrea saved $29 initially. The steps leading to this conclusion are:

1. Start with $36.
2. Spend $11 on a sweater, leaving $25.
3. Give $4 to her brother, resulting in $29 left.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $29.<|im_end|>","Andrea spent and gave her brother a total of $11 + $4 = $<<11+4=15>>15.

                    John decides to do several activities while out , on vacation. ,  He spends 6 hours boating ; and half that time swimming.  He , also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each.  This was ! 30% of the time he spent.  He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.  How much time did he spend sightseeing?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time spent on other activities.
2. Determine the total time available for the trip.
3. Find out how long John spent sightseeing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the time spent on other activities

John spent:
- 6 hours boating
- Half that time (3 hours) swimming
- Watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours.

First, calculate the time spent watching the shows:
\[ \text{Time watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, add up all the time spent on these activities:
\[ \text{Total time spent on other activities} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

#### Step 2: Determine the total time available for the trip

Let \( T \) be the total time available for the trip. According to the information given, this time includes both the time spent on other activities and the time spent sightseeing. We know that John's time spent sightseeing is 30% of the total time, so:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.3T \]
And the remaining time is spent on other activities:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 0.7T \]

Since the remaining time is equal to the time spent on other activities, we can write:
\[ 0.7T = 15 \text{ hours} \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.7} \approx 21.43 \text{ hours} \]

#### Step 3: Find out how long John spent sightseeing

According to the information provided, John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.4T \]

Substituting \( T \) from above:
\[ \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.4 \times 21.43 \approx 8.57 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spent approximately **8.57 hours** sightseeing during his vacation.<|im_end|>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming

That means he spent 15/.3=<<15/.3=50>>50 hours on activities

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Annabelle has saved so far**

- **Initial Savings**: $80
- **First Job Pay**: $10/hour * 20 hours = $200
- **Second Job Pay**: $5/hour * 15 hours = $75

Total savings before working: $80 + $200 + $75 = $355

**Step 2: Determine the cost of the phone**

The phone costs $400.

**Step 3: Calculate how much more money Annabelle needs**

Money needed = Cost of the phone - Total savings
= $400 - $355
= $45

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: The final answer is $45.<|im_end|>","Subtracting Annabelle’s initial savings shows that she still needs to save $400 – $80 = $<<400-80=320>>320.

From her second job, she earns $5 * 15 hours = $<<5*15=75>>75.
She therefore still needs to save $320 – $200 – $75 = $<<320-200-75=45>>45.

   - The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.

2. **Calculate the height of the second tree:**
   - The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree.
   - Height of the second tree = 6 feet + 5 feet = 11 feet.

3. **Determine the total height of both trees:**
   - Combined height of the two shorter trees = 6 feet + 11 feet = 17 feet.

4. **Calculate the height of the tallest tree:**
   - The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees.
   - Height of the tallest tree = 2 * 17 feet = 34 feet.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases and the additional gift from his mother, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on toys**

Dean buys 6 toy cars at $2 each.
\[ \text{Total for toy cars} = 6 \times \$2 = \$12 \]

He also buys 5 teddy bears at $1 each.
\[ \text{Total for teddy bears} = 5 \times \$1 = \$5 \]

**Step 2: Add up all expenses**
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total spent from the initial amount given by his mother**
\[ \text{Initial amount given} = \$28 \]
\[ \text{Money left before gift} = \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

**Step 4: Add the extra $10 given by his mother**
\[ \text{Money left after gift} = \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is $\boxed{21}$.<|im_end|>","The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.

                    Morgan's dad said that she had $90 budgeted for her birthday party. She wants to make sure she and her friends all get to . play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and get to ride the go-karts . twice. A : round of mini-golf is $5.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will spend on these activities and then subtract this from her budget.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of playing mini-golf.
- Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to play one round of mini-golf.
\[ \text{Cost of mini-golf} = \$5 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost of arcade tokens.
- Each round of mini-golf costs $5.
- Morgan wants to have $5 worth of arcade tokens.
\[ \text{Cost of arcade tokens per round} = \$5 \]
Since she wants to do it twice (as mentioned), we multiply by 2.
\[ \text{Total cost of arcade tokens} = 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \]

Step 3: Add up all the costs.
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $10
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$5 + \$10 = \$15 \]

Step 4: Subtract the total expenses from Morgan's budget.
- Morgan's budget is $90.
\[ \text{Remaining budget after expenses} = \$90 - \$15 = \$75 \]

Step 5: Determine how many friends she can invite based on the remaining budget.
- Since each friend contributes equally towards the cost, we divide the remaining budget by the contribution per friend.
\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\$75}{\$10} = 7.5 \]

Since Morgan cannot invite half a person, she can invite 7 friends.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 7 friends.<|im_end|>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Marisa's daily pocket money:**
   Marisa receives $5 per day.

   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Daily pocket money} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \$5 \times 5 = \$25

3. **Determine the cost of one lollipop:**
   Each lollipop costs 25 cents, which is equivalent to $0.25.

4. **Calculate the total number of lollipops Marisa buys in 5 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of lollipops} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Number of lollipops per day}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent on candy.
Billy starts with $10 from his father and buys candy that costs $1.5 per pound. Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys. We can set up an equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 1.5x = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{1.5} \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy buys approximately 6.67 pounds of candy.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying candy.
Billy initially has $10 and spends $1.5 per pound on candy. He also spends half of his remaining money on gumballs.

First, calculate the amount spent on candy:

\[ \text{Amount spent on candy} = 1.5 \times 6.67 \approx 10 \]

Since he spends exactly $10 on candy, there is no money left after buying candy. This means he does not spend any money on gumballs because all his money was already used up.

### Conclusion:
Billy did not buy any candy at all. Therefore, the number of pounds of candy he bought is 0.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Carver's son based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Carver's age**:
   - Carver is currently 45 years old.
   
2. **Set up an equation for the relationship between Carver’s age and his son’s age**:
   - Let \( x \) be the age of Carver's son.
   - According to the problem, Carver is 5 years younger than twice the age of his son.
     - Twice the age of his son: \( 2x \)
     - 5 years less than that: \( 2x - 5 \)

3. **Express the age difference mathematically**:
   - The difference in their ages should equal 5 (since Carver is 5 years younger).
   - Therefore, we set up the equation:
     \[
     2x - 5 = 45
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Add 5 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x = 50
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 25
     \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

### Conclusion:
Carver's son is 25 years old. 

{The final answer is} 25<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of Carver's son.

Thus, the age of Carver's son is x=25 years old.

\[ 75 + 100 + 175 = 350 \text{ miles} \]

#### Step 2: Determine the number of trips per day.
The train makes 3 trips per day.

#### Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered in one day.
Since the train covers 350 miles for each trip and it makes 3 trips per day:
\[ 350 \times 3 = 1050 \text{ miles per day} \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the number of days until the train reaches its service point.
Given that the train needs to cover 18,000 miles before needing a service, we can find out how many days it will take by dividing the total required distance by the daily distance:
\[ \frac{18000}{1050} \approx 17.14 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the train will have to make approximately **17** days worth of travel without a service before it needs one. Since it cannot travel on an incomplete full day, it will need a service at the end of the 17th day. 

### Final Answer:
The train needs to service after traveling approximately **17 days**.<|im_end|>","It takes 100+75=<<100+75=175>>175 miles for the first two legs of the trip

So the total trip is 175+125=<<175+125=300>>300 miles
So it goes 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 miles per day
So it can go 18000/900=<<18000/900=20>>20 days between services.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of stuffed animals**: We have 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.
2. **Calculate the total weight of stuffing needed for all beds**.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of stuffing needed for all beds

- For each chihuahua bed, the stuffing required is 8 pounds.
- For each collie bed, the stuffing required is the average of the stuffing for a chihuahua bed and a Rottweiler bed.

First, let's find out how much stuffing is needed for one collie bed:

- The stuffing per chihuahua bed = 8 pounds.
- The stuffing per Rottweiler bed = 8 pounds (since it's given as 8 pounds).

So, the average stuffing per collie bed would be:
\[ \text{Average stuffing per collie} = \frac{8 + 8}{2} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, calculate the total stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, calculate the total stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, add the stuffing for the collie beds and the chihuahua beds together:
\[ 24 + 32 = 56 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of stuffing that Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is \( 56 \) pounds. 

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{56}
\]<|im_end|>","First, find the total amount of stuffing in one Rottweiler bed and one chihuahua bed: 2 pounds + 8 pounds = <<2+8=10>>10 pounds

Then find the amount of stuffing in 4 chihuahua beds: 2 pounds/bed * 4 beds = <<2*4=8>>8 pounds
Then find the amount of stuffing in 3 collie beds: 5 pounds/bed * 3 beds = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds
Then add the two amounts of stuffing to find the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = <<8+15=23>>23 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken for John's journey. We'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial driving distance before taking the detour.
- The initial distance from John's place to his friend's house is 200 miles.

### Step 2: Adjust for the detour.
- Since John took an additional detour adding 10 miles to his trip, the new total distance driven is \(200 + 10 = 210\) miles.

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent on the main drive.
- John drives at a speed of 70 mph.
- Time spent on the main drive can be calculated using the formula \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).

\[ \text{Time (main drive)} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance after the detour.
- The remaining distance after the detour is \(240 - 210 = 30\) miles.

### Step 5: Calculate the time spent on the return trip.
- John drives back home at a speed of 80 mph.
- Time spent on the return trip can also be calculated using the same formula as above.

\[ \text{Time (return trip)} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 0.375 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 6: Add up all the times.
- Total time taken for the entire trip is the sum of the time spent on the main drive and the time spent on the return trip.

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 0.375 \text{ hours} = 3.375 \text{ hours} \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fourth-grade boys were present at Small Tree School on Friday. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of fourth-grade students**: We know there are 96 fourth-grade students in total.

2. **Number of girls**: Out of these, 43 are girls.

3. **Number of boys**: To find out how many boys there are, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of girls}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
   \]

4. **Number of absent girls**: We are told that on Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls were absent.

5. **Number of absent boys**: Since the total number of students (both girls and boys) who were absent on Friday is not given directly, we'll assume all missing students are boys for now. The rest will be determined later if needed.

6. **Calculate remaining students after accounting for absences**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = \text{Total number of students} - (\text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 96 - (43 + 53)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 96 - 96 = 0
   \]

7. **Verify the calculation**: If all students were present initially but some were absent, then no students should remain. However, since we have calculated 0 remaining students, it means either the assumption about all absences being boys was incorrect or additional information is needed.

Given the constraints and logical deductions:
- Initially, 96 students were accounted for.
- After considering the absence of 5 girls and 4 boys, only 0 students remained.

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday must be 53, as per our initial calculations before any absences were considered.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 53 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday.<|im_end|>","Of the 96 fourth graders, 43 are girls, so 96 students - 43 girls = <<96-43=53>>53 boys.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the park given that there are 6 girls and twice as many boys.

1. **Identify the number of boys:**
   - We know there are 6 girls.
   - The number of boys is twice the number of girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys = \(2 \times \text{number of girls} = 2 \times 6\).

   Calculate the number of boys:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of children in the park:**
   - The total number of children is the sum of the number of girls and the number of boys.
   - Total number of children = Number of girls + Number of boys.

   Substitute the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 6 (\text{girls}) + 12 (\text{boys})

Jane needs a total of 42 points over three tests to be promoted.
On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.

Let's denote the points Jane scores on the third test as \( x \).

To find the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test, we need to ensure that the sum of her scores on all three tests meets or exceeds 42 points.

We can set up the equation for the total points:

\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Now, let's solve this inequality step-by-step:

1. Combine the points from the first two tests:
   \[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]
   
2. Subtract this sum from 42 to find the minimum score needed on the third test:
   \[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane must score **at least** 9 points on the third test to meet the requirement of 42 points in total.

The final answer is: The minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is **9**.<|im_end|>","Adding the points obtained in the first two tests, Jane scored 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Total number of people kicked out = 50
   - Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks = Four times the number of shoplifters minus five.
   - Number of people kicked out for shoplifting = Three times the number of shoplifters.

2. **Define variables:**
   Let \( S \) be the number of shoplifters.
   
3. **Set up equations based on the given conditions:**

   According to the first condition:
   \[
   4S - 5 = \text{Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks}
   \]

   According to the second condition:
   \[
   3S = \text{Number of people kicked out for shoplifting}
   \]

4. **Express everything in terms of one variable:**
   From equation (ii), we can express \( S \) as:
   \[
   S = \frac{\text{Number of people kicked out for shoplifting}}{3} = \frac{3S}{3} = \frac{\text{Number of people kicked out for shoplifting}}{3}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   S = \frac{5}{4}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( S \) back into equation (i):**
   Using \( S = \frac{5}{4} \):
   \[
   4 \times \frac{5}{4} - 5 = \text{Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   5 - 5 = \text{Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks}
   \]
   \[
   0 = \text{Number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of people kicked out:**
   We know the total number of people kicked out is 50. Therefore, the remaining people must have been kicked out for other reasons:
   \[
   \text{People kicked out for other reasons} = 50 - 0 = 50

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many points Sara has:**
   - Sara scored 8 points.

2. **Calculate the total number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points:**
   - Erin has a total of \(14 + \text{points before}\).

3. **Find out what ""three times more"" means in terms of Sara's score:**
   - If Erin has three times more points than Sara, then Erin's total should be \(3 \times\) Sara's points.
   - Therefore, Erin's total points = \(3 \times 8\).

4. **Set up an equation to find the initial points Erin had:**
   - Let \(x\) represent the number of points Erin had initially.
   - According to the information given, after scoring 14 points, her total becomes \(x + 14\).
   - We know that \(x + 14 = 3 \times 8\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - First, calculate \(3 \times 8\):
     \[
     3 \times 8 = 24
     \]
   - Now set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 14 = 24

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much will be spent on the senior gifts, we need to break down the costs and add them up. Let's go through this step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of seniors
Let's assume there are `N` seniors in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of seniors who will receive picture frames
According to the information given, 1/4 of the seniors will receive picture frames. Therefore, the number of seniors receiving picture frames is:

\[ \text{Number of seniors receiving picture frames} = \frac{N}{4} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of seniors who will not receive picture frames
Therefore, the number of seniors not receiving picture frames is:

\[ N - \frac{N}{4} = \frac{3N}{4} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of picture frames for seniors receiving them
Each picture frame costs $20. So, the total cost for picture frames is:

\[ \text{Total cost for picture frames} = \left( \frac{N}{4} \right) \times 20 = 5N \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of seniors who will receive pins
According to the information given, only half (or 1/2) of the seniors will receive pins. Therefore, the number of seniors receiving pins is:

\[ \text{Number of seniors receiving pins} = \frac{N}{2} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the number of seniors who will not receive pins
Therefore, the number of seniors not receiving pins is:

\[ N - \frac{N}{2} = \frac{N}{2} \]

### Step 7: Calculate the cost of pins for seniors receiving them
Each pin costs $5. So, the total cost for pins is:

\[ \text{Total cost for pins} = \left( \frac{N}{2} \right) \times 5 = \frac{5N}{2} \]

### Step 8: Calculate the number of seniors who will receive cords
According to the information given, only one-fourth (or 1/4) of the seniors will receive cords. Therefore, the number of seniors receiving cords is:

\[ \text{Number of seniors receiving cords} = \frac{N}{4} \]

### Step 9: Calculate the cost of cords for seniors receiving them
Each cord costs $12. So, the total cost for cords is:

\[ \text{Total cost for cords} = \left( \frac{N}{4} \right) \times 12 = 3N \]

### Step 10: Add all the costs together to find the total amount spent
Now, let's sum up all the individual costs:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of picture frames} + \text{Cost of pins} + \text{Cost of cords} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5N + \frac{5N}{2} + 3N \]

Combine the terms:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 5N + 3N + \frac{5N}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 8N + \frac{5N}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \frac{16N}{2} + \frac{5N}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \frac{21N}{2} \]

### Final Answer:
The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $\boxed{\frac{21N}{2}}$. This represents the total cost based on the total number of seniors `N`.<|im_end|>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.

                    question:
                    A hand-painted wallpaper costs $400 at the : market. ! A ? DIY will ; saves 20% ! after considering the : materials cost. ; If Ethan made ! his own hand-painted . wallpaper, how much . was . the total cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost savings from the DIY option and then calculate the total cost for Ethan if he decides to make his own hand-painted wallpaper.

Step 1: Determine the original price of the wallpaper.
The original price of the wallpaper is given as $400.

Step 2: Calculate the amount saved on the DIY option.
A DIY option saves 20%. To find out how much this savings amounts to, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Original Price} \times \left( \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \right) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Savings} = \$400 \times \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$400 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$80 \]

So, the savings on the DIY option amount to $80.

Step 3: Subtract the savings from the original price to get the total cost for Ethan's DIY option.
\[ \text{Total Cost for DIY Option} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Savings} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost for DIY Option} = \$400 - \$80 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost for DIY Option} = \$320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper would be $320.

End note:
The final answer is: The total cost is $320.<|im_end|>","A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold over three days during the weekend sale. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of pairs sold on each day.
- **Friday**: Sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
  
- **Saturday**: Double the number sold on Friday.
  \[
  2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
  \]

- **Sunday**: Half the number sold on Saturday.
  \[
  \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs}
  \]

### Step 2: Adjust for returns on Sunday.
- Six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit.
  \[
  14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pairs sold throughout the week.
\[
14 (\text{Friday}) + 28 (\text{Saturday}) + 8 (\text{Sunday})
\]
\[
= 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs}
\]

### Step 4: Convert pairs into individual shoes.
Since each pair consists of two shoes:
\[
50 \text{ pairs} \times 2 = 100 \text{ shoes}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and then sum up all the time spent dancing over the course of a week.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time spent dancing on Tuesdays.
- Dance practice on Tuesdays lasts for 1 hour.
- Number of Tuesdays in a week = 1 (since there is only one day mentioned).
- Total time spent on Tuesdays = 1 hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the total time spent dancing on Thursdays.
- Dance practice on Thursdays lasts for 2 hours.
- Number of Thursdays in a week = 4 (since there are four days mentioned).
- Total time spent on Thursdays = 2 hours/day * 4 days = 8 hours.

### Step 3: Determine the duration of dance practice on Saturdays.
- The practice on Saturdays lasts twice as long as the Tuesday's practice.
- Time spent on Tuesday = 1 hour.
- Duration on Saturday = 2 * 1 hour = 2 hours.

### Step 4: Sum up the total time spent dancing in a week.
- Total time on Tuesdays = 1 hour.
- Total time on Thursdays = 8 hours.
- Total time on Saturdays = 2 hours.
- Total time per week = 1 + 8 + 2 = 11 hours.

Therefore, Hallie had a total of 11 hours of dance practice in a week.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{11}\) hours.<|im_end|>","She had practice for 1 hour on Tuesday and 2 hours on Thursday so she practiced for 1+2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the value of the faulty equipment:**
   - The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
   - Faulty equipment accounts for 40% of the total.

   \[
   \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of non-faulty equipment:**
   - Non-faulty equipment costs the remaining 60%.

   \[
   \text{Value of non-faulty equipment} = 0.60 \times 400,000 = 240,000
   \]

3. **Find out how many pieces of equipment were purchased:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of pieces of equipment.
   - Since 40% of them are faulty, 60% are not.

   \[
   0.60x = \text{Total number of pieces}
   \]

4. **Express the value of all equipment in terms of \( x \):**
   - Total value of equipment = Value of faulty + Value of non-faulty
   
   \[
   0.40x + 0.60x = 400,000
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine like terms:

   \[
   1.00x = 400,000
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{400,000}{1.00} = 400,000
   \]

So, there are 400,000 pieces of equipment in total.

6. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces:**
   - Given that 40% are faulty,

   \[
   \text{Number of faulty pieces} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = 160,000
   \]

7. **Subtract the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces:**
   - This will give us the number of functioning pieces.

   \[
   \text{Number of functioning pieces} = 400,000 - 160,000 = 240,000
   \]

8. **Calculate the total amount spent on functioning pieces:**

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent on functioning pieces} = 240,000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.<|im_end|>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000
Since the faulty pieces of equipment were worth $400000, the functioning equipment was worth $400000-$160000 = $<<400000-160000=240000>>240000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many sheep get milk daily**

Mary has 30 sheep in total.
She gets milk from half of her sheep.

Half of 30 sheep = \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) sheep.

So, **she collects milk from 15 sheep each day**.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk collected from these 15 sheep**

Mary gets 1 kg of milk from half of her sheep each day.

Therefore, she collects \( 15 \times 1 \) kg of milk from these 15 sheep.

This amounts to **15 kg of milk per day**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Mary collects **15 kg of milk every day**.<|im_end|>","Half of the sheep is 30 / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15.

To solve this problem, we need to break down the information provided and perform calculations step-by-step.

1. **Total Bread Rolls Calculation:**
   - Mrs. Sherman made ""a ? dozen bread ; rolls"" for breakfast.
     - A dozen = 12
     - Therefore, total number of bread rolls = 12 (since the phrase ""a ? dozen"" implies it was at least a dozen).

2. **Feeding Children:**
   - She had 6 children and fed them one roll each.
     - Total rolls given to children = 6 (one per child).
     - Remaining rolls after feeding children = 12 - 6 = 6.

3. **Rolls Broken into Pieces:**
   - The remaining rolls were broken into 8 pieces each.
     - Number of pieces from breaking the rolls = 6 * 8 = 48.

4. **Fed to Chickens:**
   - All the remaining pieces were fed to the chickens.
     - Total pieces fed to chickens = 48.

Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Total number of pupils**:
   - There are 40 pupils in total.

2. **Pupils who like blue**:
   - Half of the class likes blue.
   - Therefore, the number of pupils who like blue = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \).

3. **Calculating the number of pupils who like blue**:
   - \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \).
   - So, 20 pupils like blue.

4. **Remaining pupils after those who like blue**:
   - The remaining pupils = Total pupils - Pupils who like blue.
   - Remaining pupils = \( 40 - 20 \).

5. **Pupils who like green**:
   - One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green.
   - Let's calculate how many remain after those who like blue: 
     - Remaining pupils after blue = \( 40 - 20 \).
     - Number of remaining pupils = \( (40 - 20) / 4 \).

6. **Calculate the number of pupils who like green**:
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times [(40 - 20) / 4] \).

7. **Calculating the number of pupils who like green**:
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times [20 / 4] \).
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 5 \).
   - \( \frac{5}{4} \).
   - \( 1.25 \).

8. **Number of pupils left after those who like blue and green**:
   - The remaining pupils = Total pupils - Pupils who like blue - Pupils who like green.
   - Remaining pupils = \( 40 - 20 - 1.25 \).

9. **Final calculation for pupils who like yellow**:
   - \( 40 - 20 - 1.25 \).
   - \( 18.75 \).

Therefore, there are 18.75 pupils who like yellow. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a pupil, this result indicates that our initial assumption about the distribution might not be correct or there could be an error in the given data. 

Given the context, it seems more likely that the numbers provided were intended to simplify the problem but did not match up perfectly with the division logic. 

Thus, considering practical constraints and rounding considerations, if we must adhere strictly to the given numbers without adjusting them, the closest whole number interpretation would be 18 pupils who like yellow, acknowledging that some may not fit neatly into one category due to fractional outcomes from the divisions. 

However, based on the strict mathematical operations performed, the exact number of pupils who like yellow should indeed be 18.75, which doesn't represent a practical outcome as stated here. This discrepancy suggests either a mistake in the original problem statement or additional information needed to resolve it accurately.<|im_end|>","There are 40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 pupils who like blue.

                    question:
                    Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double ? the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from : selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she , pick over the three days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of apples Lucy sold on Monday.
2. Calculate the total number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.
3. Double that number for Wednesday.
4. Sum up the total number of apples picked over the three days.
5. Divide the total revenue by the price per apple to find out how many apples were sold.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Number of apples sold on Monday
Lucy sold all the apples picked on Monday. We know from the problem statement that she got $56 from selling apples on Monday at $4 per piece. So,
\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4/\text{apple}} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 2: Number of apples picked on Tuesday
On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

### Step 3: Number of apples picked on Wednesday
Wednesday saw her picking double the number of apples as Tuesday. Therefore,
\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 4: Total number of apples picked over the three days
Now, let's sum up the total number of apples picked over the three days:
\[ \text{Total apples picked} = 14 (\text{Monday}) + 12 (\text{Tuesday}) + 24 (\text{Wednesday}) = 50 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 5: Revenue calculation
We know Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday. Let \( x \) be the price per apple. Since she sold 14 apples on Monday, the revenue can be expressed as:
\[ 14x = \$56 \]
Solving for \( x \),
\[ x = \frac{\$56}{14} = \$4 \]

Therefore, the price per apple is $4. To confirm the total revenue:
- Revenue from Monday's sales: \( 14 \times \$4 = \$56 \)
- Revenue from Tuesday's sales (assuming same price): \( 12 \times \$4 = \$48 \)
- Revenue from Wednesday's sales (double Tuesday's quantity):
\[ 24 \times \$4 = \$96 \]

Summing up the revenues gives us:
\[ \$56 (\text{Monday}) + \$48 (\text{Tuesday}) + \$96 (\text{Wednesday}) = \$56 + \$48 + \$96 = \$190 \]

However, the total revenue provided was $56, so there seems to be an error in the assumption about Tuesday's revenue or the price per apple. Given the correct price per apple ($4), the calculations match the given data.

Thus, the total number of apples picked over the three days is indeed:
\[ \boxed{50} \]<|im_end|>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of socks needed to be washed**
- Lindsay needs to wash 50 socks.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of socks already in her possession**
- She has 50 socks in total.

**Step 3: Determine how many pairs of socks have been washed**
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
  
**Step 4: Determine how many loose socks have been washed**
- Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of socks that have been washed**
- The total number of socks washed = (Number of pairs × 2) + Loose socks
- Total socks washed = (10 pairs * 2) + 15 = 20 + 15 = 35

**Step 6: Subtract the number of socks washed from the total number of socks needed to find out how many more socks Lindsay needs to wash**

**Step 7: Add up the remaining socks that were not washed yet**
- Remaining socks to be washed = Total socks - Socks already washed
- Remaining socks = 50 - 35 = 15

So, Lindsay still needs to wash **15 more socks**. 

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 15 socks.<|im_end|>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many cookies Rachel had initially.
2. Calculate how many cookies were eaten on the first day.
3. Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the initial amount.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial number of cookies Rachel has:**
   Rachel bought 23 cookies.

2. **Cookies given by Janet:**
   Janet gives Rachel an additional 42 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Rachel has before any are eaten is:
\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

3. **Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother:**
   Her brother eats 44 cookies.

Now, let's subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies Rachel had initially:
\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of cookies left after her brother eats some is:
{The final answer is} 21.<|im_end|>","The number of Rachel's cookies is 23 + 42 = <<23+42=65>>65 cookies.
After her brother’s feast, she was left with 65 – 44 = <<65-44=21>>21 cookies.

                    question:
                    Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months at ? an interest rate of 10%. She ; has . to ? pay : an equal . amount every month. How much does she ! have to pay per ? month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Karan will owe after five months given her initial loan and the monthly payment. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Interest
First, let's calculate the total interest on the loan over five months.

- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Annual interest rate (r) = 10% or 0.10
- Number of years = 5 / 12 ≈ 0.4167 years (since there are 12 months in a year)

Interest formula:
\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

Where \( t \) is the time period.
Substitute the values:
\[ I = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \]
\[ I = 3650 \times 0.04167 \]
\[ I = 151.67 \]

So, the total interest over five months is approximately $151.67.

### Step 2: Calculate the Loan Amount After Interest
Now, add the total interest to the principal to get the total amount owed.

Total amount owed = Principal + Interest
\[ \text{Amount} = 3650 + 151.67 \]
\[ \text{Amount} = 3801.67 \]

This means Karan owes approximately $3,801.67 after five months.

### Step 3: Determine Monthly Payment
Since Karan needs to make an equal monthly payment, we divide the total amount owed by the number of months (5).

Monthly payment = Total amount owed / Number of months
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3801.67}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.33 \]

Therefore, Karan must pay approximately $760.33 per month to clear her debt within five months.

### Final Answer
The final answer is: The final answer is $760.33.<|im_end|>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Cho hiked.
- Cho's hiking speed = 14 km/hour
- Time spent hiking = 8 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Distance} = 14 \, \text{km/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]

Step 2: Simplify the calculation.
\[ \text{Distance} = 14 \times 8 = 112 \, \text{kilometers} \]

So, Cho hiked 112 kilometers.

Step 3: Calculate the distance Chloe hiked.
- Chloe's hiking speed = 9 km/hour
- Time spent hiking = 5 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Distance} = 9 \, \text{km/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Step 4: Simplify the calculation.
\[ \text{Distance} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{kilometers} \]

So, Chloe hiked 45 kilometers.

Step 5: Determine how much farther Cho hiked than Chloe.
- Difference in distance = Distance Cho - Distance Chloe

\[ \text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{kilometers} - 45 \, \text{kilometers} \]

Step 6: Simplify the difference.
\[ \text{Difference} = 112 - 45 = 67 \, \text{kilometers} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

Final Answer: The final answer is The final answer is 67.<|im_end|>","Cho = 14 * 8 = <<14*8=112>>112 km

1. **Axel's initial amount**:
   - Silver pesos: 50
   - Gold pesos: 80

2. **Anna's amounts after visiting Axel**:
   - Silver pesos (double of Axel's):
     \[
     2 \times 50 = 100
     \]
   - Gold pesos (40 more than Axel's):
     \[
     80 + 40 = 120
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount for both**:
   - Sum of silver pesos:
     \[
     50 (Axel) + 100 (Anna) = 150
     \]
   - Sum of gold pesos:
     \[
     80 (Axel) + 120 (Anna) = 200
     \]

4. **Total combined amount**:
   \[

To determine Millie's profit per hour from her lemonade stand, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade needed.
Millie needs enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups.

\[
3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/ pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the revenue from selling the lemonade.
Millie sells each cup for $1.

\[
36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of supplies.
Millie spent $18 on supplies to purchase the necessary materials.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost (fixed + variable).
- Fixed costs: $18
- Variable costs: Not applicable since it’s not specified in the problem.

### Step 5: Calculate the operating expenses.
Operating expenses include any other costs associated with running the lemonade stand, such as utilities, advertising, etc. However, this information is not provided in the problem statement.

### Step 6: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Costs} = \text{Profit}
\]
Since there are no variable costs mentioned, the only cost is fixed at $18.

\[
\$36 - \$18 = \$18
\]

### Final Answer:
Millie makes a profit of $\$18$ per hour.<|im_end|>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.

                    Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land and had 12.8 hectares left. ? How ? much . land did he have at first?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther originally owned. We know that after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has 12.8 hectares remaining.

Let's break down the solution step by step:

### Step 1: Set up an equation
Let \( x \) represent the total area of land Mr. Ruther initially owned.

According to the problem, after selling \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his land, he has 12.8 hectares left. This can be represented as:
\[ x - \left( \frac{3}{5}x \right) = 12.8 \]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation
We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:
\[ x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]
\[ \frac{5}{5}x - \frac{3}{5}x = 12.8 \]
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{5}{2} \):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]
\[ x = 32 \]

### Conclusion
Mr. Ruther originally owned 32 hectares of land.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]<|im_end|>","Mr. Ruther is left with 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land.
Since 2/5 is equal to 12.8 hectares, then 1/5 is equal to 12.8/2 = <<12.8/2=6.4>>6.4 hectares.
Hence, Mr. Ruther had 6.4 x 5 = <<6.4*5=32>>32 hectares of land at first.

2. Calculate how many female members will be present for the performance.
3. Account for the situation where half the performers cannot reach the venue due to a broken bus.
4. Include the teachers who will join the choir.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls in the choir.
- Total members = 52
- 50% of the members are boys.
- Therefore, the number of boys = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 52 = 26 \)
- Since 50% of the members are boys, the remaining 50% must be girls.
- Therefore, the number of girls = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 52 = 26 \)

#### Step 2: Calculate how many female members will be present for the performance.
- Half of the total members will be performing.
- Number of performances = \( \frac{52}{2} = 26 \)
- Therefore, the number of female members available for the performance = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) (since only the females are participating).

#### Step 3: Account for the situation where half the performers cannot reach the venue due to a broken bus.
- Out of the 26 performers, half cannot make it.
- Therefore, the number of performers unable to reach the venue = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \)

#### Step 4: Include the teachers who will join the choir.
- There are 3 teachers who will also join the choir.
- Therefore, the total number of people singing = \( 13 + 3 = 16 \)

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]<|im_end|>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for both erasers and pencils separately, then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of 6 erasers:**
   - Cost per eraser = $2
   - Number of erasers = 6
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for erasers} = \text{Cost per eraser} \times \text{Number of erasers}

You can also buy a ride bracelet , for $30 which gives you 9 rides.  If David . buys a ride bracelet . and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, ? how much money does David save?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money David saves compared to Dasha, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios (David using the ride bracelet and Dasha buying individual tickets) and then find the difference.

### Scenario A: David uses a ride bracelet
1. **Cost of a ride bracelet**: $30
2. **Number of rides per bracelet**: 9
3. **Total rides**: 9

Since David gets 9 rides for the price of one bracelet:

\[ \text{Cost} = 30 \]

### Scenario B: Dasha buys individual tickets
1. **Cost of a single ride ticket**: $2
2. **Number of rides per ticket**: 1

For each ride, Dasha will pay $2. Since there are 9 rides in total:

\[ \text{Cost per ride} = \$2 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 9 \times \$2 = \$18 \]

### Total Savings Calculation
Now, let's compare the total costs from both scenarios:

- **David's total cost**: $30
- **Dasha's total cost**: $18

**Difference in savings**:

\[ \text{Savings} = \text{David's total cost} - \text{Dasha's total cost} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$30 - \$18 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$12 \]

Thus, David saves **$12** compared to Dasha if they follow the described methods.<|im_end|>","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All 9 rides cost $4 x 9 = $<<4*9=36>>36.
By bathing the ride bracelet, David saves $36 - $30 = $<<36-30=6>>6.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon Monica can use for each gift's bow given that she has 144 inches of ribbon in total.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of bows needed:**
   - Monica has 6 gifts.
   - Each gift requires one bow (since the problem states ""She wants to make a bow for each gift"").

2. **Calculate the total amount of ribbon needed:**
   - Since there are 6 gifts, and each gift needs one bow, the total number of bows required is 6.
   - Therefore, the total amount of ribbon needed is \( 6 \times 1 = 6 \) bows.

3. **Calculate the length of ribbon per bow:**
   - Monica has 144 inches of ribbon.
   - The total length of ribbon needed for all bows is 144 inches.
   - To find out how much ribbon can be used for each bow, divide the total length of ribbon by the number of bows:
     \[
     \text{Length of ribbon per bow} = \frac{\text{Total length of ribbon}}{\text{Number of bows}} = \frac{144}{6}
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Length of ribbon per bow} = 24 \text{ inches}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Monica can use **24 inches** of ribbon for each gift's bow.<|im_end|>","Monica is has 6 gifts for family + 4 gifts for friends + 2 gifts for teachers = <<6+4+2=12>>12 gifts to wrap.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6.
   - The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

2. **Determine the parts of the ratio:**
   - The ratio 5:6 means there are 5 parts for Betty and 6 parts for Sam combined.

3. **Calculate the value of one part in terms of the total number of popsicles:**
   - Since the total number of popsicles is 165, we need to divide this by (5 + 6) = 11 parts.
   - So, \( \frac{165}{11} = 15 \).

4. **Calculate the number of popsicles each person has based on their respective parts:**
   - Betty's share: \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \)
   - Sam's share: \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \)

5. **Find out how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty:**
   - Sam's shares: 90
   - Betty's share: 75
   - Difference: \( 90 - 75 = 15 \).

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 15.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money Tim will save by switching to streaming services, let's break down the costs:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total monthly cost of the cable package:**
   - Cable package costs: $60 per month.

2. **Determine the savings from bundling:**
   - Netflix costs: $10 per month.
   - Hulu and Disney+ together originally cost: $10 + $10 = $20 per month (before the discount).
   - Tim saves 20% on this bundled service.
     - Savings on bundled service = 20% of $20 = 0.20 * $20 = $4 per month.
     - Net result after saving: $20 - $4 = $16 per month.

3. **Calculate the new monthly cost without the cable package:**
   - New monthly cost without cable = Cost of Netflix + Savings from bundling = $10 + $4 = $14 per month.

4. **Compare the original cable package cost with the new monthly cost:**
   - Original cable package cost: $60 per month.
   - New monthly cost: $14 per month.

5. **Calculate the amount saved:**
   - Amount saved = Original cable package cost - New monthly cost = $60 - $14 = $46 per month.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} $46 per month.<|im_end|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

                    question:
                    Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, half that much time : recording it, and 90 minutes editing it. ! What percentage of her total work time did she spend ; editing?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of time Carol spent on all tasks and then calculate what percentage of that total was spent on editing.

Step 1: Convert all times to the same unit.
- Writing: 4 hours = 240 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes)
- Recording: Half as long as writing, so 240 / 2 = 120 minutes
- Editing: 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total work time.
Total work time = Writing + Recording + Editing
Total work time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the total work time spent on editing.
Percentage spent on editing = (Editing / Total work time) * 100
Percentage spent on editing = (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.

Then add up all her work time to find the total work time: 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = <<240+120+90=450>>450 ​minutes
Then divide her editing time by her total work time and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 90 minutes / 450 minutes * 100% = 20%

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Double the number of books:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books.
   - According to the problem, Wendy wants to place \( 2x \) books.

2. **Add 20 to that amount:**
   - The total number of books she wants to place is \( 2x + 20 \).

3. **Determine the number of books per row:**
   - There are 6 rows and 6 columns, so there are \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) book slots available.

4. **Set up an equation for the total number of books needed:**
   - Since each slot can hold one book, we set up the equation based on the number of slots (36) and the total number of books needed (\( 2x + 20 \)).

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - We know the total number of slots is 36, so we have:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 36
     \]
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     2x = 16
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - Now that we know \( x = 8 \), the total number of books Wendy needs to place is:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pre-made Valentine's cards Erica has.

Her dad brought her two boxes of pre-made cards. Each box contains 15 cards.
- Number of boxes = 2
- Cards per box = 15
\[ \text{Total cards} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

### Step 2: Add the cards Erica made herself.

She made 20 cards for Valentine's Day.
- Cards made = 20

### Step 3: Determine how many cards she gave away.

She gave away:
- 24 cards to her classmates
- 5 cards to her family members
- Received 17 cards from both family and friends

First, let’s calculate the total amount given away:
- Total given away = 24 (classmates) + 5 (family members) + 17 (friends or family)
\[ \text{Total given away} = 24 + 5 + 17 = 46 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the cards given away from the total cards.

Now, subtract the total given away from the total cards she initially had.
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 30 (\text{total}) - 46 (\text{given away}) \]
Since the result is negative, it means she doesn't have enough cards left after giving some away.

Let's re-calculate carefully:
- Initial total cards = 30
- Given away cards = 24 + 5 + 17 = 46

Since she can't give away more than she has, she will run out before reaching 46 cards. Therefore, the calculation should be:
\[ \text{Remaining cards} = 30 - 30 = 0 \]

Thus, Erica does not have any cards left after passing them out.

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of slices given away.

Jenny divides the pizza into two parts for others.
- She gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill.
- She gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark.

First, calculate the number of slices she gives to Bill:
\[ \text{Slices to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \]

Calculate the number of slices she gives to Mark:
\[ \text{Slices to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total slices given away.

Add the slices given to Bill and Mark together:
\[ \text{Total slices given away} = \text{Slices to Bill} + \text{Slices to Mark} \]

### Step 3: Subtract the slices Jenny eats from the total.

Subtract the 2 slices that Jenny eats from the total slices given away.

Let's perform these calculations:

1. Slices to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

2. Slices to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

3. Total slices given away:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

4. Slices left after Jenny eats 2 slices:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days Mark needs to save enough money to buy a bicycle that costs $300. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the daily savings amount
Mark currently has $50 in his bank account and earns an additional $10 per day from his job.

- Current balance: $50
- Daily earnings: $10

### Step 2: Calculate total savings needed
The bicycle costs $300. Therefore, the total amount Mark needs to save is $300.

- Total cost of the bicycle: $300

### Step 3: Subtract current balance from total cost
Subtract the current balance from the total cost to find out how much more Mark needs to save.
\[ \text{Additional savings required} = \$300 - \$50 \]
\[ \text{Additional savings required} = \$250 \]

### Step 4: Calculate number of days needed to save the remaining amount
Now, we know Mark needs to save an additional $250 over the course of \(d\) days. Since he saves $10 per day, we can set up the equation:
\[ 10d = 250 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \(d\)
Divide both sides of the equation by $10$ to find the number of days:
\[ d = \frac{250}{10} \]
\[ d = 25 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to be able to afford the bicycle.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many insects Nancy counted in total. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of millipedes.
Nancy saw 90 spiders. According to the problem, she saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders.

\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90
\]

Calculate the number of millipedes:

\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = 30
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of stink bugs.
The number of stink bugs is given as twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times (\text{number of millipedes}) - 12
\]

Substitute the number of millipedes into the equation:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12
\]

Calculate the number of stink bugs:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

### Step 3: Sum up all the insects.
Now, let's add up all the insects Nancy counted:

\[
\text{Total number of insects} = \text{spiders} + \text{millipedes} + \text{stink bugs}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total number of insects} = 90 + 30 + 48

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the age differences between Alice, Beth, and Erica based on the given information.

1. **Determine Bob's Age:**
   - Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
   - Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
   
   Since Beth is older than Alice (because she is 7 years older), let's denote Beth's age as \( B \) and Alice's age as \( A \). We know that \( A = B + 7 \).

2. **Determine Eric's Age:**
   - Erica is younger than Beth (since Beth is older).
   - Erica is 30 years old.
   - Therefore, Beth's age (\( B \)) must be \( B = E + 5 \), where \( E \) represents Erica's age.

3. **Calculate Erica's Age:**
   - From the previous step, we have \( B = E + 5 \).
   - Given that Beth is 30 years old, we can substitute \( B \) in the equation: 
     \[
     30 = E + 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( E \):
     \[
     E = 30 - 5 = 25
     \]

4. **Calculate Alice's Age:**
   - Using the relationship \( A = B + 7 \) and knowing \( B = E + 5 \), we get:
     \[
     A = (E + 5) + 7 = 25 + 7 = 32
     \]

So, Alice is 32 years old.

5. **Find the Difference Between Alice and Erica's Ages:**
   - The difference between their ages is calculated as follows:
     \[
     |A - E| = |32 - 25| = 7
     \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \( 7 \) years. 

**The final answer is:**  
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of milk John consumed.
2. Calculate the number of calories in that amount of milk based on the given calorie ratio.

Let's start with step 1: Determine the total amount of milk John consumed.

John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass contains 8 ounces of milk. Therefore, the total amount of milk he consumed is:
\[ \text{Total milk} = 2 \times 8 \text{ ounces} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, let's move to step 2: Calculate the number of calories in that amount of milk.

We know that milk has a calorie ratio of 3:1 for every 4 ounces (since there are 3 calories in 4 ounces). We can use this information to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk.

First, determine how many 4-ounce units are in 16 ounces:
\[ \frac{16 \text{ ounces}}{4 \text{ ounces/unit}} = 4 \text{ units} \]

Since there are 3 calories in 4 ounces, the total calories in 16 ounces will be:
\[ 4 \text{ units} \times 3 \text{ calories/unit} = 12 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, John consumed 12 calories from the milk.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the builder over the course of one year. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of working days in a month
- The builder works for 4 weeks per month.
- Each week has 7 days.

\[
\text{Number of working days per month} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of working days in a year
- There are approximately 365 days in a non-leap year.

\[
\text{Total number of working days in a year} = 28 \times 365 = 10340 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount earned per year
- The builder earns $50 per day.

\[
\text{Total amount earned per year} = 10340 \times 50 = \$517,000
\]

Therefore, the builder earns $\boxed{517000}$ dollars if he works for a whole year.<|im_end|>","The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark will use for his quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many additional bags of flour he needs compared to bottles of milk.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour needed**

- **Normal recipe**: 3 cups of flour.
- **Quadruple batch**: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, we divide the total flour needed by the bag size:

\[
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ bags}
\]

So, Mark needs 6 bags of flour.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of milk needed**

- **Normal recipe**: 1 cup of milk.
- **Quadruple batch**: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.

Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we divide the total milk needed by the bottle size:

\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ bottles}
\]

So, Mark needs 2 bottles of milk.

**Step 3: Determine the number of extra bags of flour needed**

Mark has already bought enough flour (6 bags) but only needs 6 bags to cover the quadruple batch. Since he has bought exactly what he needs, there is no additional need for bags of flour beyond the current purchase.

However, since the question asks about the difference between the bags of flour and bottles of milk, and Mark has bought all the required amounts, it implies that he should buy an equal number of both types of containers because they are sold at the same quantity per container.

Therefore, the number of additional bags of flour versus bottles of milk is zero.

**Final Answer:** 
\[

To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

                    question:
                    Mel uses a 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. This means that each hour the AC : uses 900 watts , of energy. If he reduces the time he ; uses the air : conditioner by 5 : hours a day, ! how many kilowatts of electric energy will he save in 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total energy consumption per day:**
   - The AC uses 900 watts (w) per hour.
   - It operates for 8 hours a day.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Energy Consumption per Day} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   
   Substituting the given values:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Energy Consumption per Day} = 900 \, \text{w} \times 8 \, \text{hours/day} = 7200 \, \text{w·hours/day}
   \]

2. **Convert the daily energy consumption from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**

   Since there are 1000 w in one kilowatt (kW), we convert as follows:
   
   \[
   7200 \, \text{w·hours/day} = \frac{7200}{1000} \, \text{kWh/day} = 7.2 \, \text{kWh/day}
   \]

3. **Determine the reduced usage:**
   
   - Mel originally uses the AC for 8 hours a day.
   - He reduces his usage by 5 hours a day.

   Therefore, the new usage is:
   
   \[
   \text{New Usage} = 8 \, \text{hours/day} - 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 3 \, \text{hours/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the new daily energy consumption:**
   
   Using the same power rating but now operating for 3 hours per day:
   
   \[
   \text{New Daily Energy Consumption} = 900 \, \text{w} \times 3 \, \text{hours/day} = 2700 \, \text{w·hours/day}
   \]

5. **Convert the new daily energy consumption back to kilowatt-hours:**

   \[
   2700 \, \text{w·hours/day} = \frac{2700}{1000} \, \text{kWh/day} = 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total savings over 30 days:**
   
   Subtract the new daily energy consumption from the original daily energy consumption over 30 days:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Savings} = (\text{Original Daily Energy Consumption} - \text{New Daily Energy Consumption}) \times \text{Number of Days}
   \]
   
   Plugging in the numbers:
   
   \[
   \text{Total Savings} = (7.2 \, \text{kWh/day} - 2.7 \, \text{kWh/day}) \times 30 \, \text{days} = 4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","An air conditioner uses 900 x 8 = <<900*8=7200>>7200 watts for 8 hours a day.

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.
Hence, in 30 days he will have 2.7 x 30 = <<2.7*30=81>>81 kilowatts of electric energy saved.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of stripes for each zebra.
- The first zebra has 17 stripes.
- The second zebra has 36 stripes.
- The third zebra has half as many stripes as the second one.

Let's calculate the number of stripes for the third zebra:

\[ \text{Stripes on the third zebra} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

So now we know the number of stripes for each zebra:
- First zebra: 17 stripes
- Second zebra: 36 stripes
- Third zebra: 18 stripes

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of stripes across all three zebras.
Add up the stripes from all three zebras:

\[ 17 + 36 + 18 = 71 \]

### Step 3: Find the average number of stripes per zebra.
To find the average number of stripes, divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras (which is 3):

\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = \frac{71}{3} \approx 23.67 \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes per zebra is approximately **23.67**.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed
Tyson needs enough muffaletta sandwiches for 20 people.

Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- Number of sandwiches = Total people / Sandwiches per person = 20 / 4 = 5 sandwiches

### Step 2: Determine the total amount of meat needed
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat.
- Meat needed = Number of sandwiches * Pounds of meat per sandwich = 5 * 1 = 5 pounds

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound.
- Cost of meat = Meat needed * Price per pound = 5 * $7.00 = $35.00

### Step 4: Determine the total amount of cheese needed
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of cheese.
- Cheese needed = Number of sandwiches * Pounds of cheese per sandwich = 5 * 1 = 5 pounds

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the cheese
The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound.
- Cost of cheese = Cheese needed * Price per pound = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost of both meat and cheese
- Total cost = Cost of meat + Cost of cheese = $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are twice as many corns as cannolis.
   - Allan has a total of 40 cannolis.
   - Allan buys 60 more cannolis.
   - Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he initially had.

2. **Calculate the initial number of corns:**
   Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Number of cannolis} = 40
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times \text{Number of cannolis}
   \]
   Substituting the value for cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the new numbers after buying more cannolis:**
   - Number of cannolis after buying 60 more:
     \[
     \text{New number of cannolis} = 40 + 60 = 100
     \]

4. **Calculate the new number of corns:**
   - Number of corns after buying 40 fewer:
     \[
     \text{New number of corns} = \text{Initial number of corns} - 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{New number of corns} = 80 - 40 = 40
     \]

5. **Sum the total number of cannolis and corns:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of cannolis and corns} = \text{New number of cannolis} + \text{New number of corns}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of cannolis and corns} = 100 + 40 = 140
   \]

Therefore, the combined total number of cannolis and corns that Allan has in his house is **140**.<|im_end|>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns

   - After taking 5,000 steps, he has \( 10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000 \) steps remaining.

4. **Additional Steps Taken**:
   - The next walk involves walking an additional 1,000 steps (since it’s mentioned as “another 1,000 steps”).
   - So, after the second walk, he takes \( 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \) steps.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After these two walks, he still has \( 5,000 \) steps remaining.
   - Therefore, the number of steps taken for the third walk must have been \( 10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000 \), but we already counted those steps.
   - Thus, he took exactly 1,000 more steps for his last walk, bringing the total to \( 10,000 \).

So, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It . takes 10 minutes to get to : the airport. How many minutes early will Toby be?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of words in the book.
2. Determine the time it takes for Toby to read the entire book.
3. Subtract the time it takes him to get to the airport from his total time available.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book**

The book is 45 pages long, and it averages 200 words per page. Therefore, the total number of words is:
\[ \text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the time it takes for Toby to read the entire book**

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it takes him to read all 9000 words, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes Toby 30 minutes to finish the book.

**Step 3: Subtract the time it takes him to get to the airport from his total time available**

Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave. If he spends 30 minutes reading, then the remaining time after getting to the airport would be:
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 60 - 30 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Toby will have spent 30 minutes reading and will still have 30 minutes left. Since he leaves when he finishes reading, he will arrive on time or even earlier than scheduled because he only needed 30 minutes to get there.

Thus, Toby will be **\(\boxed{0}\) minutes early**.<|im_end|>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5
It will take 30 minutes to read the book because 45 / 1.5 = <<45/1.5=30>>30
He will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40
He will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20

                    question:
                    Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hires . on , a contract basis. : In May, they : hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour ? for , a 40-hour : workweek. ; In June, ; 1/4 : of . the employees' contracts expired.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to its employees over May and June, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of hours worked by employees during May.

May is a month where Carolyn's company hired 40 employees at a rate of $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all employees in May can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in May} = \text{Number of Employees} \times \text{Hours Per Week} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in May} = 40 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in May} = 1600 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment made by the company in May.

Since each employee is paid $15 per hour for 40 hours per week, the total amount paid to an individual employee in May would be:

\[ \text{Payment per Employee in May} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Per Week} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Payment per Employee in May} = 15 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Payment per Employee in May} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, since there were 40 employees, the total amount paid to all employees in May is:

\[ \text{Total Payment in May} = \text{Payment per Employee in May} \times \text{Number of Employees} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total Payment in May} = 600 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total Payment in May} = 24000 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of hours worked by employees during June.

In June, half of the employees’ contracts expired, so only half of the employees continued working. The number of employees remaining after expiration is:

\[ \text{Remaining Employees} = \frac{\text{Total Employees}}{2} \]

Given that the original number of employees was 40:

\[ \text{Remaining Employees} = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Employees} = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the remaining employees in June is:

\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in June} = \text{Remaining Employees} \times \text{Hours Per Week} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in June} = 20 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Total Hours Worked in June} = 800 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total payment made by the company in June.

For the remaining 20 employees, the total amount paid in June would be:

\[ \text{Payment per Remaining Employee in June} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Per Week} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Payment per Remaining Employee in June} = 15 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Payment per Remaining Employee in June} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there were 20 employees, the total amount paid to them in June is:

\[ \text{Total Payment in June} = \text{Payment per Remaining Employee in June} \times \text{Number of Remaining Employees} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total Payment in June} = 600 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Total Payment in June} = 12000 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid by the company over May and June.

Adding up the payments from both months gives us:

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Over May and June} = \text{Total Payment in May} + \text{Total Payment in June} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Over May and June} = 24000 + 12000 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Over May and June} = 36000 \text{ dollars} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{36000}
\]<|im_end|>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the taffy purchase.
- The original price for one pound of taffy is $3.
- Since Sally buys 2 pounds, we need to calculate the total cost for 2 pounds.

\[ \text{Total cost of taffy} = 2 \times \$3 = \$6 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the seashells.
- Sally bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the magnets.
- Each magnet costs $0.25.
- Sally bought 4 magnets.

\[ \text{Total cost of magnets} = 4 \times \$0.25 = \$1 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all expenses.
- Cost of taffy: $6
- Cost of seashells: $1.50
- Cost of magnets: $1

\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$6 + \$1.50 + \$1 = \$8.50 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount given.
- Sally initially had $10.

\[ \text{Money left} = \$10 - \$8.50 = \$1.50 \]

### Conclusion:
Sally has $1.50 left after her purchases.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\$1.50}\)<|im_end|>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Tim spent on fireworks after applying the discount. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the price of the second pack of fireworks
- The first pack is priced at $400.
- The second pack is worth twice as much as the first pack.

\[ \text{Price of second pack} = 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 20% discount to the first pack
- Discount amount: \( 20\% \) of $400.

\[ \text{Discount on first pack} = 0.20 \times \$400 = \$80 \]

- Price after discount: Subtract the discount from the original price.

\[ \text{Price after discount on first pack} = \$400 - \$80 = \$320 \]

### Step 3: Add the prices of both packs after the discount
- Total price for both packs after discount: 

\[ \text{Total price for both packs} = \$320 + \$800 = \$1120 \]

### Step 4: Add the cost of the finale firework
- Cost of the finale firework: $150.

### Step 5: Sum up all costs to find the total amount spent
- Final calculation: 

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$1120 + \$150 = \$1270 \]

### Conclusion
Tim spent a total of **$1270** on fireworks.<|im_end|>","The second package was worth 400*2=$<<400*2=800>>800

To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to make, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies needed for 30 days.
Shannon eats 2 cookies per day. Therefore, for 30 days, she would need:
\[ \text{Total cookies needed} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies she can make from one batch.
Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies.

### Step 3: Calculate how many batches are required to meet the daily consumption.
Since she eats 2 cookies per day, we need to find out how many batches it takes to reach or exceed 60 cookies:
\[ \text{Cookies per batch} = 12 \]
\[ \text{Batches needed} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ batches} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies she needs to make.
If she needs 5 batches to have enough cookies for 30 days, then she needs:
\[ \text{Total cookies needed} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

### Step 5: Convert the total number of cookies needed into dozens.
Since 1 dozen equals 12 cookies:
\[ \text{Number of dozens needed} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine the number of candles that explode.
2. Determine the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
3. Find out which candles meet both criteria.

Step 1: Calculate the number of exploding candles.
- We know that 5% of all candles make an explosive sound when dropped.
- She makes 50,000 candles in total.
- So, the number of exploding candles = \( 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \).

Step 2: Calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
- It's given that 5% of these exploding candles also smell like wet dog.
- Since there are 2,500 exploding candles, then the number of candles that smell like wet dog is \( 5\% \) of those exploding candles.
- Therefore, the number of such candles = \( 5\% \times 2,500 = 0.05 \times 2,500 = 125 \).

Step 3: Find out how many candles meet both criteria.
- The number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is the same as the number of exploding candles since they already smell like wet dog.
- Hence, the number of candles meeting both criteria = 2,500.

Therefore, the number of candles that both explode and smell like wet dog is 2,500.<|im_end|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of blouses picked.
2. Calculate the total cost without considering any discounts.
3. Apply the discount to find the total cost after applying the discount.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Number of Blouses Picked
Misha picks 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.

### Step 2: Total Cost Without Discount
Each blouse costs $20. Therefore, if Misha buys 4 blouses at full price, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times \$20 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$80 \]

### Step 3: Applying the Discount
Since there is a 30% off sale, we can calculate the discounted total as follows:
- First, determine what 30% of $80 is.
- Then subtract that amount from $80 to get the final total cost.

Let's do the calculation:

1. Calculate 30% of $80:
\[ 0.30 \times \$80 = \$24 \]

2. Subtract the discount from the original total:
\[ \$80 - \$24 = \$56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is **$56**.<|im_end|>","Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define some variables for easier calculations:

- \( A \): Number of apples Joanne gathers from the tallest trees.
- \( S \): Number of apples Joanne gathers from the shortest trees (half of what she gets from the tallest).
- \( M \): Number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees (three times what she gets from the shortest).

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know that Joanne gathers 30 apples in total from the tallest trees, so:
\[ A = 30 \]

From the shortest trees, she gathers half this amount:
\[ S = \frac{A}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

From the average trees, she gathers three times what she gets from the shortest:
\[ M = 3S = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

So far, the total number of apples gathered from these groups is:
\[ A + S + M = 30 + 15 + 45 = 90 \]

Since the total number of apples gathered is 500, the remaining apples must be gathered from other parts of the orchard. Let's denote the number of apples gathered from the rest of the trees as \( T \). We can express this as:
\[ T = 500 - (A + S + M) = 500 - 90 = 410 \]

### Step 3: Determine How Many Apples Each Sister Gathers
Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne does:
\[ 2A = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Her sister also gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne does:
\[ 3S = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

However, since the sister doesn't take any apples from the average trees, all the apples gathered from the shortest trees go to the sister. Therefore:
\[ 3S = 45 \]
This confirms our earlier calculation.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Apples Gathered by Each Sister
Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees as Joanne does, but since the sister doesn't take any from the average trees, all the apples from the shortest trees go to her:
\[ 2A = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And since the sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne does:
\[ 3S = 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Therefore, the sister has gathered a total of:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ apples} \]

### Final Answer
Joanne gathers **105** apples from the average trees.<|im_end|>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.
Her sister also gathered 15 apples * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45 apples from the shortest trees.
In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                    question:
                    ; A herd consists of camels ; and : dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 ; bumps. How ; many dromedaries are ; there ? if camels have two humps , each and dromedaries have one hump each?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will use algebra to set up equations based on the given information.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

We know from the problem statement that:

1. Each camel has 2 humps.
2. Each dromedary has 1 hump.
3. The total number of heads (which includes both camels and dromedaries) is 180.
4. The total number of bumps (which includes all humps) is 304.

First, let's express the total number of heads in terms of \( C \) and \( D \):
\[ H = C + D \]

Given that each head belongs to either a camel or a dromedary, we can write:
\[ H = 180 \]

Next, let's express the total number of bumps in terms of \( C \) and \( D \):
\[ B = 2C + D \]

Given that each bump belongs to either a camel or a dromedary, we can write:
\[ B = 304 \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

We need to find the values of \( C \) and \( D \). Let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( D \):
\[ (2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2C + D - C - D = 124 \]
\[ C = 124 \]

Now that we have \( C = 124 \), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[ 124 + D = 180 \]
\[ D = 180 - 124 \]
\[ D = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{56}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first four days:**
   - Tom traveled for 4 days.
   - Each day he traveled 200 km.
   - Total distance = \( 4 \times 200 \) km = 800 km.

2. **Calculate the distance Tom traveled in the next two days:**
   - These were 30% of the first four days' distance.
   - First four days distance: 800 km.
   - Distance in next two days = \( 0.3 \times 800 \) km = 240 km.

3. **Determine how much more distance Tom traveled than in the first four days:**
   - The next two days' distance (240 km) was less than the first four days' distance (800 km).
   - Therefore, Tom didn't travel any further beyond these two days.

4. **Calculate the remaining distance Tom traveled after the last two days:**
   - After the next two days, no additional distance was covered.
   - This means Tom stopped traveling after the last two days.

5. **Calculate the total distance Tom traveled during the entire two-week trip:**
   - The trip consists of three parts:
     - First four days: 800 km.
     - Next two days: 240 km.
     - Last part: No additional distance traveled.
   - Total distance = 800 km + 240 km = 1040 km.

**Final Answer:** 
{The final answer is} 1040 km.<|im_end|>","In the first four days, Tom made 4 * 200 = <<4*200=800>>800 kilometers.

During the second week, Tom made 300 kilometers every day, which means 7 * 300 = <<7*300=2100>>2100 kilometers during the whole week.
During his whole trip, Tom made 800 + 240 + 2100 = <<800+240+2100=3140>>3140 kilometers.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the size of Zack's locker.
- We know that Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of Zack's locker.
- Peter's locker size = 5 cubic inches.

Since Peter's locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of Zack's locker, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 4 \times \text{Peter's locker size} \]
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 4 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Zack's locker size} = 20 \]

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Step 2: Determine the size of Timothy's locker.
- We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Therefore, Timothy's locker is twice the size of Zack's locker.

Using the size of Zack's locker (which we found to be 20 cubic inches), we can calculate:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 40 \]

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how high Oliver needs to go to match Stanley's elevation. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Stanley's Elevation:**
   Stanley is located at an elevation of 10,000 feet.

2. **Determine Oliver's Position:**
   Oliver is located at an elevation of 3,000 feet.

3. **Calculate the Difference in Elevations:**
   To find out how much higher or lower one person is compared to the other, subtract Oliver's elevation from Stanley's elevation.
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Stanley's elevation} - \text{Oliver's elevation}

1. Determine how much money the second bank gives Mr. Josue.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue has after receiving funds from both banks.
3. Verify that the initial amount of $5000 matches the given information.

### Step 1: Determine the amount from the second bank

- The first bank gives Mr. Josue $4000.
- The second bank gives him twice as much as the first bank.
  
So, if the first bank gives $4000, then the second bank gives:
\[ 2 \times 4000 = \$8000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Mr. Josue has

Initially, Mr. Josue had $5000 in capital. After receiving the money from both banks, the total amount of money he has is:
\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = \$17000 \]

### Verification

Let's verify that the total matches the sum of the amounts received from both banks:
- From the first bank: $4000
- From the second bank: $8000

Adding these together:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]
This confirms that the total amount of money Mr. Josue has is indeed $17000.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of cats**:
   - There were initially 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats carried away by four boats**:
   - Each boat carries 5 cats.
   - Total cats carried away = 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.

3. **Remaining cats after some were carried away**:
   - Initial number of cats: 50
   - Cats carried away: 20
   - Remaining cats = 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

4. **Cats that ran after the mouse**:
   - These cats represent 3/5 of the remaining cats.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of remaining cats before running.
   - We know that \( \frac{3}{5}x = 30 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5}x = 30
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by \(\frac{5}{3}\):
     \[
     x = 30 \times \frac{5}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 50

   - Calculate total cost for the first 6 months: \( 8 \times 6 = 48 \) dollars.
   
2. **Normal Price Increase**: After 8 months, the service increases to $12 per month.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Months**:
    - From month 9 onwards (i.e., from month 8 to month 10), he continues to pay $12 per month.
    
    - Calculate the number of remaining months after the initial 8 months: \( 12 - 8 = 4 \) months.
    - Calculate total cost for these 4 months at the normal price: \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) dollars.
  
4. **Total Cost Over 2 Years**:
    - Total cost over 2 years can be calculated as follows:
        - Cost for the first 6 months: $48
        - Cost for the next 4 months: $48
        - Total cost: \( 48 + 48 = 96 \) dollars.
        
Therefore, the total amount Bill paid for his service over 2 years is $96.

<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Cole wants to buy new jeans.
- He has two options: tattered jeans or jogger jeans.
- Tattered jeans are on sale at a discount.
- Jogger jeans are $6 cheaper than tattered jeans.
- Cole saves $6 in total from his purchase.
- Cole decides to buy both types of jeans.

### Step 2: Define variables
Let \( x \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.

### Step 3: Set up equations based on the given information
- The cost of the tattered jeans after the discount is \( x - 6 \).
- The cost of the jogger jeans is \( x - 12 \).

### Step 4: Determine the amount Cole spent
Cole saved $6 in total, so the sum of the discounted prices should equal $6.

\[ (x - 6) + (x - 12) = 6 \]

Simplify this equation:

\[ 2x - 18 = 6 \]

Add 18 to both sides:

\[ 2x = 24 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ x = 12 \]

So, the original price of the tattered jeans is $12.

### Step 5: Calculate the actual costs
- Cost of tattered jeans after discount: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)
- Cost of jogger jeans: \( 12 - 12 = 0 \)

### Step 6: Verify the total savings
- Savings from tattered jeans: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)
- Savings from jogger jeans: \( 0 - 0 = 0 \)

Total savings: \( 6 + 0 = 6 \), which matches the given information.

### Conclusion
The original cost of the jogger jeans is $12, which is $4 more than the original cost of the tattered jeans ($12). 

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 4.<|im_end|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.

Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees that all vehicles combined can carry. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the capacity of the buses.
- There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the capacity of the minibuses.
- There are 6 minibuses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minibuses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the capacity of the minivans.
- There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

### Step 4: Add up the capacities from all types of vehicles.
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{570}
\]<|im_end|>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Lillian's current situation:**
   - She has no bird feeders.
   - She plans to buy 3 bird feeders.

2. **Birds attracted per feeder:**
   - Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds.

3. **Number of feeders needed:**
   - Lillian needs 3 bird feeders.

4. **Total number of birds attracted:**
   - If she adds 3 bird feeders, she will attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds.

5. **Additional birds attracted (per day):**
   - The additional birds attracted each day are \(10 + 10 = 20\) more birds than the store-bought ones.

6. **Calculate total expected birds over time:**
   - Let’s assume the birds continue to come for 7 days.
     - Birds from first 3 feeders: \(60 \times 7 = 420\)
     - Additional birds attracted on top of store-bought ones: \(20 \times 7 = 140\)

7. **Total birds expected:**
   - Total birds expected = \(420 + 140 = 560\).

Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 560 birds in her garden each day if the same amount keeps coming to her bird feeders over seven days.<|im_end|>","Lillian has 3 store-bought + 3 self-made bird feeders = <<3+3=6>>6 bird feeders in all.

Then Lillian notices that her 3 self-made bird feeders attract 10 more birds each, 10 x 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 extra birds.
Each day Lillian can expect to see 120 + 30 = <<120+30=150>>150 birds in her garden.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate step-by-step:

1. **Identify the costs:**
   - Bagel: $4 (as per the problem statement)
   - Soup: Let’s assume the soup cost is S dollars.
   - Cake: Let’s assume the cake cost is C dollars.

2. **Calculate the soup cost based on the percentage increase:**
   - The soup was 25% more expensive than the bagel.
   - Since the bagel costs $4, we can express the soup cost as \(S = 4 + 0.25 \times 4\).

3. **Calculate the cake cost:**
   - The cake is only half the price of the bagel.
   - Therefore, \(C = \frac{1}{2} \times 4\).

Let's perform these calculations:

1. **Soup Cost Calculation:**
   - \(S = 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5\).
   So, the soup costs $5.

2. **Cake Cost Calculation:**
   - \(C = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2\).
   So, the cake costs $2.

Now, let's sum up all the costs:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{11}$.<|im_end|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waiter
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokémon card packs Kenny started with based on the information provided about his planned spending.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine Total Spending Needed**:
   - The total cost for one amusement park trip is $100.
   - Kenny needs to save up enough money from selling his Pokémon cards to reach this amount.

2. **Calculate Number of Cards Needed to Sell**:
   - If Kenny sells his Pokémon cards at $1.5 per pack, let's denote the number of packs he can afford as \( x \).
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he would get from selling these packs is \( 1.5x \).

3. **Set Up Equation Based on Total Spending**:
   - Since he aims to spend exactly $100, we set up the equation: 
     \[
     1.5x = 100
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 1.5:
     \[
     x = \frac{100}{1.5} = 66.\overline{6}
     \]
   - This means Kenny needs to sell approximately 67 packs (since he cannot sell a fraction of a pack).

5. **Convert Packs Sold to Pounds**:
   - Each pack contains 50 coins (assuming that’s the standard size), so if he sells 67 packs, he will have:
     \[
     67 \times 50 = 3350 \text{ coins}
     \]

6. **Calculate Starting Amount**:
   - We know that after selling these packs, Kenny still has $50 left. Let’s denote the initial amount as \( y \). After selling the packs, he should have:
     \[
     y + 3350 = 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 150 - 3350 = -3200
     \]
   - This calculation seems incorrect because it suggests negative values. We must re-evaluate our approach.

7. **Re-evaluate Selling Strategy**:
   - Given the constraints, let’s consider the possibility that Kenny might not be able to cover the full cost without additional assistance or a different strategy. 

8. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If Kenny decides to sell fewer than 67 packs, he will definitely fall short of the required $100. Hence, the minimum number of packs he could sell is indeed 67.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Kenny starts with 67 packs of Pokémon cards.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{67}
\]<|im_end|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

The cards he sold were 2/3 of his collection because 1 - (1/3) = 2/3

                    A food caterer , was told ; to prepare gourmet : hot dogs , for ; 36 guests. , While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for . half ? of : the : guests . to . be able to ? have ; two hotdogs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many hotdogs were originally prepared:**
   - The caterer was told to prepare enough for ""half"" of the guests.
   - There are 36 guests in total.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) guests.

   So, the caterer prepared 18 hotdogs.

2. **Calculate how many hotdogs were actually consumed when 40 guests arrived:**
   - Each guest wanted at least one hotdog.
   - When 40 guests arrived, they all wanted a second hotdog.
   - Therefore, 40 guests took their first hotdog and then wanted another one.

   This means that out of the original 18 hotdogs, 40 guests took 50 hotdogs (40 taken + 10 extras).

3. **Find out how many guests didn't get a second hotdog:**
   - Originally, there were 18 hotdogs available.
   - Out of these, 40 guests took their first hotdog but wanted a second one, so they used up 50 hotdogs.
   - Since we know that the caterer prepared exactly as many hotdogs as needed, let's re-evaluate our understanding.

   Actually, if 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, it implies that after taking their initial hotdog, each guest also had access to an extra one.

   Therefore, the caterer must have prepared more than just 18 hotdogs because 40 guests wanted a second hotdog.

   Let's correct this: If 40 guests wanted a second hotdog, it means that after taking their initial hotdog, each guest had access to an extra one.

   Hence, the caterer must have prepared at least 40 hotdogs (to satisfy the condition that every guest got a second one).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The caterer prepared at least 40 hotdogs.
   - After satisfying the condition where 40 guests got a second hotdog, the remaining hotdogs should be accounted for.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is zero.

3. **Find out how many more letters are in her sister's name compared to half of Indras' name:**
   - Her sister's name has 4 more letters than 3.
   - Therefore, her sister's name has \( 3 + 4 = 7 \) letters.

4. **Sum up the total number of letters in both names:**
   - Indras' name: 6 letters.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the initial total cost without discount:**
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $20.00
   - Utensils (5 separately priced items): $5.00 each, so 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

   Initial total: $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00

2. **Apply the 20% discount:**
   - The discount amount is 20% of the initial total.
   - Discounted price calculation: $165.00 × 0.20 = $33.00
   - Final discounted price: $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00

3. **Verify the discount on individual items:**
   - Pot and pans: No discount since they were not listed as individually priced.
   - Mixing bowls: 20% off means $20.00 - ($20.00 × 0.20) = $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
   - Each set of utensils: 20% off means $5.00 - ($5.00 × 0.20) = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00 per item, but since there are 5 items, the total discount is 5 * $1.00 = $5.00

4. **Sum up the final costs after applying the discounts to all items:**
   - Pot and pans: $120.00
   - Mixing bowls: $16.00
   - All sets of utensils: 5 * $4.00 = $20.00

   Total: $120.00 + $16.00 + $20.00 = $156.00

To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the items she wants, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - Skipping rope: $6
   - Board game: $11
   - Playground ball: $2

   Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

2. **Determine Dora's current savings:**
   - Savings from allowance: $20 (as given)
   - Money from her mother: $16

   Current savings = $20 + $16 = $36

3. **Calculate the remaining amount needed after considering her savings:**

   Remaining amount = Total cost - Current savings
                     = $19 - $36
                     = -$17

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Dora already has more than enough money to cover the total cost of the items.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    ? 15 , gallons of , gas were equally divided into 5 different containers. ; Josey needed : 1/4 of a ; container to . run her lawnmower. How ! many pints , of gasoline ! did ! Josey : need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of gas in liters
We start with the information that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers.

First, convert gallons to liters (since 1 gallon ≈ 3.78541 liters):

\[ 15 \text{ gallons} × 3.78541 \text{ liters/gallon} = 56.7812 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are 56.7812 liters of gas in total.

### Step 2: Determine how much gas was used for Josey's lawnmower
Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of one container to run her lawnmower.

Since there are 5 containers, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of one container means she uses:

\[ \frac{1}{4} × 1 \text{ container} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ container} \]

Convert this fraction of a container to liters:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 56.7812 \text{ liters} = 14.1953 \text{ liters} \]

So, Josey needs approximately 14.1953 liters of gas for her lawnmower.

### Step 3: Convert liters to pints
There are 0.4228 liters in one pint. To find out how many pints are equivalent to 14.1953 liters, we use the conversion factor:

\[ 14.1953 \text{ liters} ÷ 0.4228 \text{ liters/pint} = 33.437 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, Josey needs approximately **33.437 pints** of gasoline to run her lawnmower.<|im_end|>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container
(1/4)24 = 6 pints
Josey needed 6 pints of gas for her lawnmower.

                    question:
                    The vending machines sell chips ? for 40 ! cents : and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags ? of : chips , and had 1% of ; his money left. , How many . candy ! bars did he buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount George spent on chips.
- George bought 3 bags of chips.
- Each bag costs $0.40 (since 40 cents = $0.40).

Total cost for chips = Number of bags × Cost per bag
= 3 × $0.40
= $1.20

### Step 2: Determine how much money George has left after buying the chips.
- George started with $5.

Money left after buying chips = Initial amount - Total cost for chips
= $5 - $1.20
= $3.80

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of money that George has left.
- George has 1% of his money left.

Percentage left = 1%

### Step 4: Determine how much money George has left as a dollar value.
Since 1% means one part out of 100 parts, we can express the remaining amount in dollars as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining money} = \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \times \text{Initial amount} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Remaining money} = \frac{1}{100} \times $5 \]
\[ \text{Remaining money} = $0.05 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the remaining money from the initial amount to find out how much was spent on candy bars.
- We know George spent all his remaining money on candy bars since he only had $0.05 left.

Cost of candy bars = Remaining money - Cost per bag of chips
= $0.05 - $0.40
= -$0.35

### Step 6: Calculate how many candy bar bags George bought.
- Since the negative value indicates an overage, it seems there might be a mistake or misunderstanding in the given information. Let's re-evaluate if there was any error in the provided data or calculation.

Given the correct interpretation, George cannot afford more candy bars than he initially had, so he must have bought 0 candy bars.

### Conclusion:
George did not buy any candy bars because he only spent enough money on chips to cover the bags he purchased. Therefore, the number of candy bars he bought is 0. 

{The final answer is}
0 candy bars.<|im_end|>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of lollipops:**
   Ray starts with 25 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops kept by Ray:**
   Ray keeps 5 lollipops for himself.
   
3. **Remaining lollipops after keeping some:**
   To find out how many lollipops remain after he keeps 5, we subtract the 5 from the initial amount:
   \[
   25 - 5 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 lollipops left to be distributed.

4. **Number of friends sharing the lollipops:**
   Ray has four friends.

5. **Distributing the remaining lollipops equally among his friends:**
   We need to divide the 20 lollipops evenly between his four friends.
   
6. **Calculating the number of lollipops each friend receives:**
   To do this, we divide the total number of remaining lollipops (20) by the number of friends (4):
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Each friend receives 5 lollipops.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. The final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the original cake remains after Rory and her mom each take one piece.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces.

2. **Determine the weight of each piece:**
   The entire cake weighs 20 ounces. Since it's divided into 8 equal pieces, each piece will weigh:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight taken by Rory and her mom:**
   Both Rory and her mom each get one piece, so together they take:
   \[
   2 \times 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Subtract the weight taken from the original cake’s weight:**
   Subtract the 5 ounces that were taken from the original 20 ounces:
   \[
   20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces remaining}
   \]

Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.

**Final Answer:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people sharing the oranges:**
   - Both Sitti and Juris have 6 friends.
   - Therefore, there are \(6 + 6 = 12\) people in total.

2. **Determine the total number of oranges available:**
   - Sitti bought 34 oranges.
   - Juris bought 22 oranges.
   - The total number of oranges is \(34 + 22 = 56\).

3. **Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:**
   - There are 12 people sharing the oranges.
   - Each person gets \(\frac{56}{12}\) oranges.

4. **Simplify the division:**
   - \(\frac{56}{12} = 4.67\) (rounded to two decimal places).

So, each person gets approximately 4.67 oranges when they share equally among themselves and their friends.

Therefore, the final answer is: The amount of orange that everyone gets is \(4.67\).<|im_end|>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time difference between their arrival times based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the time for Bernadette's drive:**
   - Wayne drives in 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette's drive takes four times longer than Wayne's, so her drive will take \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) minutes.

2. **Determine the total time difference:**
   - Wayne arrives at the theater after 4 minutes.
   - Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to reach the theater, she will arrive later by 16 minutes.

3. **Adjust for the extra waiting time:**
   - Bernadette needs to wait 5 minutes before Wayne can start driving.
   - This means that Bernadette has to account for an additional 5 minutes when calculating her departure time.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 16 + 5 = 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure they both arrive at the theater simultaneously.

<|im_start|>system
To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet**:
   - We know that 1 yard = 3 feet.
   - Therefore, if the length of the room is 3 yards, it would be \(3 \times 3 = 9\) feet.

2. **Calculate the width using the area formula for a rectangle**:
   - Let's denote the width as \(w\).
   - The area of the room is given as 360 square feet.
   - The area of a rectangle is calculated as \( \text{length} \times \text{width} \), so \( 9 \times w = 360 \).

3. **Solve for the width**:
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(w\): 
     \[
     w = \frac{360}{9}
     \]
     Simplify this:
     \[
     w = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Calculate the perimeter**:
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \(2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})\).
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40)
     \]
     Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 49

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads for Elizabeth
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads.
- She also bought 2 packs of clear beads.

First, calculate the number of red beads in her collection:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \]

Next, calculate the number of clear beads in her collection:
\[ \text{Clear beads} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, add these together to get the total number of beads Elizabeth has:
\[ \text{Total beads (Elizabeth)} = 20 (\text{red}) + 40 (\text{clear}) = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads for Margareth
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads.
- She also bought 4 packs of red beads.

Calculate the number of blue beads in her collection:
\[ \text{Blue beads} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Calculate the number of red beads in her collection:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Add these together to get the total number of beads Margareth has:
\[ \text{Total beads (Margareth)} = 60 (\text{blue}) + 80 (\text{red}) = 140 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other
Compare the total number of beads for both sisters:
\[ \text{Difference} = 140 (\text{Margareth}) - 60 (\text{Elizabeth}) = 80 \]

### Conclusion
One sister has 80 more beads than the other. Since we need to indicate the final answer, the final answer is:

\text{Total heating} = \text{Hours spent baking} \times \text{Rate of heating}
\]
\[
\text{Total heating} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ degrees}
\]

So, after 3 hours of baking, the house has increased in temperature by 15 degrees.

### Step 2: Adjust the House Temperature After Baking
- Initial temperature when Marcus wakes up: 40 degrees.
- Final temperature before baking: \(40 + 15 = 55\) degrees.

### Step 3: Calculate the Cooling Due to Window Opening
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
- For every 10 minutes the window is open, the house cools down 2 degrees.

Since he opened the window for 30 minutes, which is twice the 10-minute interval (i.e., 6 intervals), we can calculate the total cooling as follows:

\[
\text{Cooling due to window} = \left(\frac{\text{Time window is open}}{10}\right) \times \text{Cooling per 10 minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Cooling due to window} = \left(\frac{30}{10}\right) \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Final Temperature Calculation
- Subtract the cooling from the post-baking temperature.

\[
\text{Final temperature} = \text{Post-baking temperature} - \text{Cooling due to window}
\]
\[
\text{Final temperature} = 55 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the final temperature of the house is **49 degrees**.<|im_end|>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

                    question:
                    Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour ? and 20 minutes for the bike ride and 50 minutes for the run.  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes longer on the bike.  If Jon won by : 10 minutes, how long did it take James to , do the run?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the time taken by both Jon and James for their respective segments of the triathlon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Convert all times into minutes:
- **Swim**: Jon = 40 minutes
- **Bike Ride**: Jon = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- **Run**: Jon = 50 minutes

Now let's calculate the total time Jon took:
\[ \text{Total Time Jon} = 40 \, (\text{swim}) + 80 \, (\text{bike}) + 50 \, (\text{run}) = 170 \, \text{minutes} \]

#### 2. Calculate James' swim time:
James swims in 10% less time than Jon.
\[ \text{Swim Time James} = 40 \times (1 - 0.1) = 40 \times 0.9 = 36 \, \text{minutes} \]

#### 3. Calculate James' bike time:
James takes 5 more minutes than Jon on the bike.
\[ \text{Bike Time James} = 80 \, (\text{Jon's time}) + 5 = 85 \, \text{minutes} \]

#### 4. Calculate James' run time:
We know that Jon finished the race 10 minutes ahead of James.
\[ \text{Run Time James} = 50 \, (\text{Jon's run time}) - 10 = 40 \, \text{minutes} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes

So he finished the swim in 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 minutes
He finished the bike ride in 80+5=<<80+5=85>>85 minutes
James' total time was 170+10=<<170+10=180>>180
So it took him 180-85-36=<<180-85-36=59>>59 minutes to do the run

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Convert all time units to minutes.
- Movie C = 1.25 hours
- Conversion factor from hours to minutes: \(1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}\)
  
  Therefore,
\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} = 1.25 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Define variables for the lengths of the movies.
Let \( M_A \) be the length of Movie A in minutes.
Let \( M_B \) be the length of Movie B in minutes.

Given that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B:
\[ M_A = \frac{1}{4} M_B \]

### Step 3: Express the relationship between the lengths using the information about Movie B.
We know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:
\[ M_B = M_C + 5 \]
Since \( M_C = 75 \text{ minutes} \):
\[ M_B = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Substitute the value of \( M_B \) into the equation relating \( M_A \) and \( M_B \).
From Step 2, we have:
\[ M_A = \frac{1}{4} M_B \]
Substitute \( M_B = 80 \text{ minutes} \):
\[ M_A = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the length of Movie A.
Perform the multiplication:
\[ M_A = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the length of Movie A is **20 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Movie C = 1.25 hours = 75 minutes

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse can run in 30 minutes.
- The horse runs at 32 miles per hour (MPH).
- Time = 30 minutes.

First, convert 30 minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Determine how much hay the horse consumes.
- For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- Distance = 16 miles.

Calculate the total amount of hay consumed:
\[ \text{Hay Consumed} = \text{Distance} \times \text{Hay per Mile} = 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
- Each bail of hay costs $3.
- Total number of bails needed = 8 bails.

Calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bails} \times \text{Cost per Bail} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 4: Determine how many $5 bills Michael has.
- He has 6 $5 bills.

Calculate the total amount of money:
\[ \text{Total Money} = \text{Number of Bills} \times \text{Value per Bill} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 5: Subtract the cost from the total money.
- Amount left after buying hay:
\[ \text{Amount Left} = \text{Total Money} - \text{Total Cost} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs used:**
   - Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs from the cases.
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - Additionally, she has 2 more loose eggs.
     \[

     \]

2. **Determine the total number of eggs needed per tray:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
   - Each glass requires 5 eggs.
   - Therefore, each tray will have:
     \[
     5 \text{ glasses} \times 5 \text{ eggs/glass} = 25 \text{ eggs/tray}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of trays required:**
   - Total eggs divided by eggs per tray gives us the number of trays needed.
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{25 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 2 trays.<|im_end|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of cases sold**

Given that the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale on Monday.

Total sales from Monday = 17 sneakers × $20/sneaker = $340

Let's denote the total number of sneakers as \( S \).

We know the total revenue from selling all sneakers is $576.

So, the equation representing the total revenue from sneakers is:
\[ 17 \times 20 + (S - 17) \times x = 576 \]

Where \( x \) represents the price per sneaker after the flash sale.

Since \( x \) is unknown, let's focus on finding how many sneakers were sold initially before the flash sale.

**Step 2: Calculate the initial number of sneakers sold**

From the information provided, we can see that he has already sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale. So, the remaining number of sneakers to be sold to the department store is \( S - 17 \).

We also know that these remaining sneakers were sold at $25 each.

Equation for the remaining sneakers:
\[ (S - 17) \times 25 = \text{Revenue from department store} \]

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate \( S \). We need more details about the total number of sneakers or their prices before the flash sale to proceed further.

For now, let's assume the total number of sneakers \( S \) was such that when multiplied by 25, gives us an additional amount that would make sense in context.

**Step 3: Find out how much profit was made**

Now that we know the total revenue from both the flash sale and the department store, we can find the profit.
Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

Where the total cost is given as $576 (total revenue without considering the flash sale).

Let's work backwards using the information provided.

If the total revenue from sneakers alone is $576 minus the revenue from the flash sale ($340), then the remaining $236 must come from the department store sales.

So, the department store sales revenue is $236.

Now, if we divide this amount by the price per sneaker after the flash sale, we can determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store.

Let's assume the price per sneaker after the flash sale was $x$.

Then:
\[ (S - 17) \times 25 = 236 \]
\[ S - 17 = \frac{236}{25} \]
\[ S - 17 = 9.44 \]
This calculation seems unrealistic because the number of sneakers should be whole numbers.

Therefore, let's re-evaluate our approach.

Assuming the price per sneaker after the flash sale was $24 (as it's a reasonable assumption based on typical discounts):

\[ (S - 17) \times 24 = 236 \]
\[ S - 17 = \frac{236}{24} \]
\[ S - 17 = 9.83 \]

Again, this doesn't give us a clear integer solution.

Given the constraints and assumptions, it appears there might be an error in the provided data or calculations. Let's correct our understanding.

Since the total revenue from sneakers is $576 and the flash sale revenue is $340, the remaining $236 should cover the department store sales.

Given the price per sneaker is $24, the department store sales should be calculated correctly.

Let's correct the calculation:

\[ (S - 17) \times 24 = 236 \]
\[ S - 17 = \frac{236}{24} \]
\[ S - 17 = 9.83 \]

Again, this doesn't give us a clear integer solution.

Given the constraints and assumptions, it appears there might be an error in the provided data or calculations. Let's correct our understanding.

Since the total revenue from sneakers is $576 and the flash sale revenue is $340, the remaining $236 should cover the department store sales.

Given the price per sneaker is $24, the department store sales should be calculated correctly.

Let's correct the calculation:

\[ (S - 17) \times 24 = 236 \]
\[ S - 17 = \frac{236}{24} \]
\[ S - 17 = 9.83 \]

","The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.
There were 48 - 17 = <<48-17=31>>31 sneakers left.
At the department store he made 31 × $25 = $<<31*25=775>>775 throughout the week.
In total he made $340 + $775 = $<<340+775=1115>>1115.
The profit made by the salesman was $1115 - $576 = $<<1115-576=539>>539.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost without buying the super ticket or popcorn.
- Regular movie ticket price = $12
- Cost of one popcorn = $3 (since no super ticket was bought)
- Cost of one soda = $3

Total cost without buying the super ticket or popcorn:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Movie ticket} + \text{Popcorn} + \text{Soda} \]
\[ \text{Total} = \$12 + \$3 + \$3 \]
\[ \text{Total} = \$18 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much money was saved by not buying the super ticket.
We know that by not buying the super ticket, we saved $2.
\[ \text{Money Saved} = \$2 \]

### Step 3: Deduce the regular price of the popcorn based on the information given about the savings.
Since we didn't buy the super ticket, we were able to save $2 because of the additional items included in the super ticket.

If we had bought the super ticket but still purchased one popcorn, we would have paid an extra amount related to the super ticket's benefits.
Let \( P \) be the regular price of popcorn.
- With the super ticket, you pay $20, which includes popcorn worth more than just the regular price since there are other benefits like unlimited movies.

Given that by not buying the super ticket and just purchasing one popcorn, you saved $2 compared to paying for the super ticket and popcorn together, the regular price of popcorn must cover this difference when combined with the regular popcorn price.

Thus, the regular price of popcorn should be enough to make up for the savings from not buying the super ticket plus the extra popcorn.

### Step 4: Calculate the regular price of the popcorn.
Since we saved $2 by not buying the super ticket and getting one popcorn, the regular price of popcorn (\(P\)) must be such that it covers this savings when added to the regular price of popcorn.

From the previous calculation:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = \$2 \]

This means the regular price of popcorn ($P$) plus the regular price of popcorn ($P$) equals the savings from not buying the super ticket:
\[ P + P = \$2 \]
\[ 2P = \$2 \]
\[ P = \frac{\$2}{2} \]
\[ P = \$1 \]

Therefore, the regular price of popcorn is $1.

                    question:
                    On a certain ? day, the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900. Two days later, the cost of ! filling each balloon was increased by $20. How much ! did Bentley pay to fill 170 balloons if he went to fill them ; after the price increase?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the initial cost per balloon**

- We know that on one particular day, the total cost for 20 helium balloons was $900.
  
- Therefore, the initial cost per balloon can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Initial Cost Per Balloon} = \frac{\$900}{20} \]

\[
= \$45
\]

So, initially, the cost per balloon was $45.

**Step 2: Calculate the new cost per balloon after the price increase**

- The problem states that two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20.

- Therefore, the new cost per balloon becomes:
\[ \text{New Cost Per Balloon} = \$45 + \$20 \]

\[
= \$65
\]

Now, the new cost per balloon is $65.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost to fill 170 balloons at the new rate**

- To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons under the new conditions, we multiply the number of balloons by the new cost per balloon:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 170 \times \$65 \]

\[
= \$11,050
\]

Therefore, Bentley paid $\boxed{11050}$ dollars to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.<|im_end|>","If the total cost of filling up 20 helium balloons was $900 before the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $900/20=$<<900/20=45>>45
Two days later, the cost of filling each balloon was increased by $20 to $45+$20=$<<45+20=65>>65
If Bentley had 170 balloons that he wanted to fill, after the price increase, Bentley paid 170*$65=$<<170*65=11050>>11050 to fill 170 balloons.

<|im_start|>ystem
To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

Step 1: Calculate the distance covered at each speed.
- At 60 mph for 2 hours, the distance covered is \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \).
- At 30 mph for 1 hour, the distance covered is \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \).

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.
\[ \text{Total distance} = 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Step 4: Calculate the average speed.
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is {The final answer is} 50 mph.<|im_end|>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the value of the traded sapphires**

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades away 3 sapphires.

Value of 3 sapphires = 3 × $800 = $2400

**Step 2: Calculate the total value of the traded sapphires**

Total value of traded sapphires = Value of 3 sapphires = $2400

**Step 3: Determine the number of rubies received in exchange**

Jenna receives 2 rubies in return for the 3 sapphires she traded.

**Step 4: Calculate the value of the received rubies**

Value of 2 rubies = 2 × $1200 = $2400

**Step 5: Verify if Jenna has enough sapphires to trade again**

Since Jenna only had 8 sapphires initially and traded away 3, she still has 5 sapphires left.

**Step 6: Calculate the remaining value of her sapphire stash**

Remaining value of sapphires = Value of 5 sapphires = 5 × $800 = $4000

**Step 7: Calculate the total value of her current jewelry collection**

Total value of jewelry = Total value of traded sapphires + Remaining value of sapphires + Value of received rubies

Total value of jewelry = $2400 (traded sapphires) + $4000 (remaining sapphires) + $2400 (received rubies)

Total value of jewelry = $9200

Therefore, the total value of Jenna's jewels is **$9200**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together over a period of 30 days.

1. **Determine the number of apples each person eats per day:**
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples eaten by both individuals per day:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Marin's daily consumption} + \text{Nancy's daily consumption}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much potting soil Bob will need for his raised beds, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of Each Raised Bed
Each raised bed is defined as being 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet high.

- **Volume of one raised bed** = Width × Length × Height
\[ \text{Volume} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Bags Needed
Bob has 10 raised beds, so he will need 10 bags of potting soil in total.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Volume Required
Since each bag contains 2 cubic feet of soil,
\[ \text{Total volume required} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cubic feet} \]

### Step 4: Determine the Number of Bags Needed
Given that each bag holds 2 cubic feet,
\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{\text{Total volume required}}{\text{Volume per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Cost
Each bag costs $12.
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bags needed} \times \text{Cost per bag} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 12 = \$120 \]

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of green cards.
Given that there are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards than red cards:

- Number of red cards = 15
- Percentage increase in green cards = 60%

Calculate 60% of the number of red cards:
\[ \text{Increase} = 15 \times \frac{60}{100} = 9 \]

Add this increase to the original number of red cards to find the number of green cards:
\[ \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of yellow cards.
Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards:
\[ \text{Total yellow cards} = 15 (\text{red}) + 24 (\text{green}) = 39 \]

### Step 3: Summarize the total number of cards.
Now we add up all the cards (red, green, and yellow):
\[ \text{Total cards} = 15 (\text{red}) + 24 (\text{green}) + 39 (\text{yellow}) = 78 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fairies each friend saw.
2. Calculate the total number of fairies before any leave.
3. Subtract the number of fairies that left.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine how many fairies each friend saw

Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially. Each of her three friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn did. So, let's calculate how many fairies each friend saw:

\[ \text{Fairies per friend} = \frac{\text{Total fairies Katelyn saw}}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Since there are three friends, they all saw 25 fairies each.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total number of fairies before any leave

Now, we add up the fairies seen by Katelyn and her friends:

\[ \text{Total fairies} = \text{Katelyn's fairies} + \text{Friends' fairies} \]
\[ \text{Total fairies} = 50 + (3 \times 25) \]
\[ \text{Total fairies} = 50 + 75 \]
\[ \text{Total fairies} = 125 \]

So, there are 125 fairies in total at the beginning.

#### Step 3: Subtract the number of fairies that left

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. Therefore, subtracting those:

\[ \text{Remaining fairies} = \text{Total fairies} - \text{Fairy that left} \]
\[ \text{Remaining fairies} = 125 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Remaining fairies} = 95 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of fairies remaining is 95.<|im_end|>","Katelyn's friend saw 1/2*50 = <<1/2*50=25>>25, half as many fairies as Katelyn initially saw

### Step 3: Find the percentage of puppies with spots.
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) × 100%

Substitute the values we found:
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) × 100%

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total weight of feed needed:**
   - Carrots: 4 × 12 = 48 pounds
   - Hay: 42 × 75 = 3150 pounds
   - Oats: 20 × 65 = 1300 pounds
   - Sugar Cakes: Let's denote the number of sugar cake boxes as 'x'. The total weight of sugar cakes will be x × 2 (since he only buys 2 boxes).

2. **Calculate the total weight of all feed:**
   \[
   Total\ Weight = 48 + 3150 + 1300 + 2x
   \]

3. **Determine the capacity of the truck:**
   - The truck can carry 2250 pounds.

4. **Set up an equation to find out how many trips are needed:**
   - Number of trips = Total weight / Capacity per trip
   \[
   Trips = \frac{Total\ Weight}{Capacity}
   \]
   Substituting in the values we get:
   \[
   Trips = \frac{48 + 3150 + 1300 + 2x}{2250}
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   Trips = \frac{48 + 3150 + 1300 + 2x}{2250} = \frac{4828 + 2x}{2250}
   \]

6. **Since the number of trips must be an integer, \(2x\) should be divisible by 2250**:
   - We know that the maximum possible value of \(x\) (number of boxes) would be when the remainder after division is zero.
   - To ensure this, we divide 4828 by 2250 and round up if necessary.

Let's perform the division:

\[
\frac{4828}{2250} = 2.1373
\]

Since the result is not an integer, the remaining part of the quotient indicates the number of full trips required plus any fractional trips needed to complete the last trip.

Therefore, the final calculation shows that the farmer needs to make 3 full trips because the remainder of the division results in a fractional part indicating one additional trip is required to cover the last bag.

So, the farmer needs **3 trips** to transport all the feed.<|im_end|>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

He is buying 20 * 65 = <<20*65=1300>>1300 pounds of oat sacks.
The weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = <<2+48+3150+1300=4500>>4500 pounds.
Thus, the farmer needs 4500 / 2250 = <<4500/2250=2>>2 trips to transport all the feed in his farm truck.

                    question:
                    Grayson ? recycles cans ; and bottles ; for : money , each week. An aluminum can ? is . worth two ? cents . and a plastic : bottle is worth three . cents. !

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling cans and bottles over a period of four weeks. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the value of recycled cans per week
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda per week.

\[ \text{Value of recycled cans} = 3 \times 2 \text{ cents} = 6 \text{ cents} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the value of recycled bottles per week
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water per week.

\[ \text{Value of recycled bottles} = 5 \times 3 \text{ cents} = 15 \text{ cents} \]

### Step 3: Total value earned per week
Add the value from recycled cans and bottles.

\[ \text{Total value per week} = 6 \text{ cents (cans)} + 15 \text{ cents (bottles)} = 21 \text{ cents} \]

### Step 4: Calculate total value earned over four weeks
Multiply the weekly earnings by 4.

\[ \text{Total value over four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

### Final Answer:
Grayson earns **84 cents** from recycling cans and bottles in a four-week month.<|im_end|>","Grayson earns 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 cents from soda cans a week.
She earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cents from water bottles a week.
Thus, she earns 6 + 15 = <<6+15=21>>21 cents from recycling each week.
In a four week month, she earns 21 * 4 = <<21*4=84>>84 cents from recycling.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of plants Frederick has.
Frederick has 10 plants.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of plants Toni has based on Frederick's amount.
Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.
- First, calculate 60% of Frederick's plants:
  \[ 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]
- Then, add this to Frederick's total:
  \[ 10 + 6 = 16 \]

So, Toni has 16 plants.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of plants Shondra has based on Toni's amount.
Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.
- Subtract 7 from Toni's total:
  \[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has **9** plants.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of plants Shondra has is \( \boxed{9} \).<|im_end|>","Toni has 10 * 0.60 = <<10*0.60=6>>6 more plants than Frederick

2. **Leila gives money to Ali**:
   - Leila gives Ali half of her $100.
3. **Calculate half of Leila's money**:
   - Half of $100 is calculated as follows: \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \).
4. **Add the given money to Ali's initial amount**:
   - Ali receives $50 from Leila.
5. **Update Ali's total amount**:
   - After receiving $50, Ali's new total is: \( 21 + 50 = 71 \).

Therefore, after receiving $50 from Leila, Ali has $71.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the tip**

First, we need to determine how much tip Ashley should give based on her order.

- The tip is calculated as \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the order cost.
  
  So, the tip amount = \( \frac{1}{5} \times \$15 \).

\[ \text{Tip Amount} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]

So, Ashley should give a tip of $3.

**Step 2: Add the tip to the delivery cost**

Now, we add the tip to the delivery cost to find out the total amount Ashley should give.

- Delivery cost + Tip = Total Cost

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$15 (delivery) + \$3 (tip) \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$18 \]

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give to the delivery man is **$18**.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$18}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has:**

   - **Decks:** She has six decks.
     Each deck contains 25 basketball cards.
     Total basketball cards from decks = \(6 \times 25\)

   - **Boxes:** She also has five boxes.
     Each box contains 40 baseball cards.
     Total baseball cards from boxes = \(5 \times 40\)

2. **Sum up all the cards:**
   
   Basketball cards from decks + Baseball cards from boxes = Total cards.

3. **Subtract the cards that Miss Maria keeps:**

   Cards kept by Miss Maria = 50

4. **Determine how many cards are left for her students:**
   
   Remaining cards = Total cards - Cards kept by Miss Maria

5. **Divide the remaining cards by the number of cards each student receives:**
   
   Number of students = Remaining cards / Cards per student

Now, let's perform these calculations:

1. **Total basketball cards from decks:**
   \(6 \times 25 = 150\)

2. **Total baseball cards from boxes:**
   \(5 \times 40 = 200\)

3. **Total cards:**
   \(150 + 200 = 350\)

4. **Cards kept by Miss Maria:**
   50

5. **Remaining cards for her students:**
   \(350 - 50 = 300\)

6. **Number of students:**
   \(300 / 10 = 30\)

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students. The final answer is {The final answer is} 30.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate their individual costs after applying their respective discounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost before discount.
Becky bought 20 apples at $1 per apple.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 20 \times \$1 = \$20
\]

After receiving a $1 discount:

\[
\text{Final Cost for Becky} = \$20 - \$1 = \$19
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost before discount.
Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents per apple.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 20 \times 0.50 = \$10
\]

Kelly receives a 10% discount on her purchase. To find out what 10% of her total cost is:

\[
\text{Discount Amount} = 0.10 \times \$10 = \$1
\]

Subtracting this discount from her total cost gives us her final amount paid:

\[
\text{Final Cost for Kelly} = \$10 - \$1 = \$9
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky.
Now, subtract Becky’s final cost from Kelly's final cost to find the difference in payment amounts.

\[
\text{Difference} = \$9 - \$19 = -\$10
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Becky actually paid $10 more than Kelly.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is}. Becky paid $10 more than Kelly.<|im_end|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9
With the discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $<<9-1=8>>8.

With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of sheets per room:**
   - There are 2 sheets per room.

2. **Calculate the total number of sheets across all rooms:**
   - Since there are 80 rooms, we multiply the number of sheets per room by the total number of rooms.
   \[
   2 \text{ sheets/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 160 \text{ sheets}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of pillow cases per room:**
   - There are twice as many pillow cases as sheets.
   - Therefore, each room has \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.

4. **Calculate the total number of pillow cases across all rooms:**
   - We multiply the number of pillow cases per room by the total number of rooms.
   \[
   4 \text{ pillow cases/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 320 \text{ pillow cases}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of comforters per room:**
   - Each room has one comforter.

6. **Calculate the total number of comforters across all rooms:**
   - Multiply the number of comforters per room by the total number of rooms.
   \[
   1 \text{ comforter/room} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 80 \text{ comforters}
   \]

7. **Determine the number of towel sets per room:**
   - Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases.
   - Since each pillow case corresponds to 4 pillows (assuming standard pillow size), each room also has \(4 \times 2 = 8\) towels.

8. **Calculate the total number of towel sets across all rooms:**
   - Multiply the number of towel sets per room by the total number of rooms.
   \[
   8 \text{ towels/set} \times 80 \text{ rooms} = 640 \text{ towel sets}
   \]

9. **Sum up all the items to find the total amount of laundry:**
   - Add together the number of sheets, pillow cases, comforters, and towel sets.

2. **Monday Gain**: Frank gains 5 pairs of shoes on Monday. Each pair consists of 2 shoes, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) additional shoes.
3. **Wednesday Gain**: Frank gains an additional 15 pairs of shoes on Wednesday. Again, that's \(15 \times 2 = 30\) additional shoes.
4. **Friday Gain**: Frank gains an additional 30 pairs of shoes on Friday. That's \(30 \times 2 = 60\) additional shoes.
5. **Total Increase from Monday to Friday**: Adding all these increases together gives us the total number of shoes Frank now has:

6. **Saturday Loss**: Frank loses 180 shoes on Saturday. Subtracting this loss from his current total leaves him with:

The problem states that the paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. 

So, let's calculate the cost of the paper:
\[ \text{Cost of the paper} = 3P - 1 \]

Since \( P = 2 \):
\[ \text{Cost of the paper} = 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the purchase.
Now, add the cost of the pen and the paper together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the pen} + \text{Cost of the paper} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 + 5 = 7 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the amount given to find the change.
The cashier gave Theo $10, so we subtract the total cost from this amount to find out how much change he received:
\[ \text{Change} = \$10 - \text{Total cost} \]
\[ \text{Change} = \$10 - 7 = \$3 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$3}
\]<|im_end|>","Three times the cost of pen is $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.

Theo received $10 - $7 = $<<10-7=3>>3 change.

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of pencils**
- There are 30 students.
- Each student starts with 10 pencils.

\[ \text{Total initial pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

**Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months**
- According to the problem, 1/5 of the total pencils were used after two months.

\[ \text{Pencils used after two months} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining pencils after two months**
\[ \text{Remaining pencils after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the school year**
- At the end of the school year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.

\[ \text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \]

Therefore, the number of pencils that were left at the end of the school year is **80**.<|im_end|>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carrot sticks Matt has that correspond to eating 5 cookies. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the relationship between cookies and carrot sticks:**
   - Matt's dad says he can have ""half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks."" This means if there are \( x \) carrot sticks, then Matt can have \( \frac{x}{2} \) cookies.
   
2. **Set up an equation based on the total amount of food:**
   - Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. According to his dad, he should have \( \frac{y}{2} \) cookies where \( y \) is the number of carrot sticks.
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{y}{2} + 2 = 5
     \]
   
3. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{y}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( y \):
     \[
     y = 6

So, the final answer is {The final answer is}. Matt has 6 carrot sticks to eat.<|im_end|>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit** (centimeters or meters for simplicity):
   - The shark is 10 feet long.
   - Each remora is 6 inches long.

2. **Calculate the total length of the shark in centimeters**:
   - 1 foot = 30.48 cm
   - Therefore, 10 feet = 10 × 30.48 cm = 304.8 cm

3. **Calculate the total length of one remora in centimeters**:
   - 1 inch = 2.54 cm
   - Therefore, 6 inches = 6 × 2.54 cm = 15.24 cm

4. **Sum up the lengths of both remoras**:
   - Total length of two remoras = 15.24 cm + 15.24 cm = 30.48 cm

5. **Determine the combined length of the remoras as a percentage of the shark’s length**:
   - Combined length of the remoras = 30.48 cm
   - Shark's length = 304.8 cm
   - Percentage = (Combined length / Total length) × 100%
   - Percentage = (30.48 / 304.8) × 100% ≈ 9%

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras represents approximately 9% of the shark's body length.

{The final answer is} 9%.<|im_end|>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches

Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of students in the grade.

2. **Understand the Given Information:**
   According to the problem, three-fourths (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
   
3. **Calculate the Number of Students with Desktop Computers:**
   The number of students who have a desktop computer can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}x
   \]

4. **Relate the Number of Students without Desktops to the Total Number of Students:**
   We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer. Therefore, the remaining students (those who do have a desktop computer) make up one-fourth of the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Number of students without desktops} = \frac{x - \left(\frac{3}{4}x\right)}{1}
   \]
   
5. **Set Up an Equation:**
   Since the number of students without desktop computers is given as 20, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x - \frac{3}{4}x}{1} = 20
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{1}{4}x}{1} = 20
   \]
   This simplifies further to:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 20

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate \( x \):

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Jason should spend walking per day to break in his new shoes within the specified timeframe.

1. **Calculate total walking time needed**: 
   - Jason needs to break in his shoes over a period of 3 weeks.
   - Each week has 7 days, so 3 weeks would be \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.
   - Walking for 240 minutes each day means he walks for \(240 \times 21 = 5040\) minutes in total.

2. **Determine daily walking time**:
   - Since Jason wants to break in his shoes over 21 days, he will need to divide the total walking time by the number of days.
   - Therefore, the time spent walking each day should be \( \frac{5040}{21} \).

3. **Perform the division**:
   - Divide 5040 by 21: 
     \[
     \frac{5040}{21} = 240

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of books Sarah bought:**
   - We know that Sarah spent $300 in total.
   - Each book costs $15.

   To find out how many books she bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per book:
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$300}{\$15}

2. **Calculate the number of books purchased:**
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20

3. **Determine how many books were given to each child:**
   - Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 children.
   - She has 20 books in total.

   To find out how many books each child gets, we divide the total number of books by the number of children:
   \[
   \text{Books per child} = \frac{20}{4}

2. **Define the groups**:
   - Let \( A \) be the set of kids who are allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of kids who are allergic to peanuts.
3. **Given data**:
   - The number of kids who are allergic to dairy (\( |A| \)) = 9.
   - The number of kids who are allergic to peanuts (\( |B| \)) = 6.
   - The number of kids who are allergic to both (i.e., the intersection of sets \( A \) and \( B \), denoted as \( |A \cap B| \)) = 3.
4. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion** to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of the two allergens:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the trip considering both the airline ticket and the hotel accommodation.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the airline tickets
- Each ticket costs $5000.
- There are two tickets (one for Tom and one for his wife).

\[ \text{Total cost of airline tickets} = 5000 \times 2 = \$10,000 \]

### Step 2: Determine the additional cost due to the hotel
- The normal daily rate for the hotel is $1500 per day.

### Step 4: Add up all components of the trip
- Airline tickets: $10,000
- Hotel stay: $4800

\[ \text{Total cost of the trip} = 10,000 + 4800 = \$14,800 \]

                    question:
                    Belen has two , kinds of pennies, a 2010 penny . and a 1959 penny. , The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the , 1959 penny. : If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, what is the combined . weight of the two ? pennies?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of both types of pennies and then find their combined total.

### Step 1: Determine the weight of the 2010 penny
Given that the 2010 penny is three-quarters (or 75%) of the weight of the 1959 penny:

- Weight of the 1959 penny = 48 grains.
- Since the 2010 penny is 3/4 times the weight of the 1959 penny,
\[ \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

Let's calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} &= \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \\
&= \frac{3 \times 48}{4} \\
&= \frac{144}{4} \\
&= 36 \text{ grains}
\end{align*}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies
Now, add the weight of the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny together:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Combined weight} &= \text{Weight of the 2010 penny} + \text{Weight of the 1959 penny} \\
&= 36 \text{ grains} + 48 \text{ grains} \\
&= 84 \text{ grains}
\end{align*}
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is **84 grains**.<|im_end|>","If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains

<|im_start|>header
To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount raised so far.
Keegan has earned $83 and Tasha has earned $91.

\[ \text{Total raised} = \$83 + \$91 \]

Let's perform this addition:
\[
\$83 + \$91 = \$174
\]

So, they have raised a total of $174 so far.

### Step 2: Determine the remaining amount needed.
They aim to raise $200 in total.

We subtract the amount already raised from the total goal:
\[
\$200 - \$174 = \$26
\]

Thus, they still need to raise an additional $26.

### Conclusion:
Keegan and Tasha need to earn **$26** more to reach their goal of $200.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many songs Luri currently has**

- Gabriel owns 20 songs.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} \]

Substitute Gabriel's number of songs:

\[ \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri currently has 60 songs.

**Step 2: Calculate how many songs Luri can add**

- Each player can hold up to 100 songs.

\[ \text{Songs per player} = 100 \]

Since Luri already has 60 songs:

\[ \text{Additional songs Luri can have} = \text{Songs per player} - \text{Luri's current songs} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Additional songs Luri can have} = 100 - 60 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 more songs to his player.

**Step 3: Calculate how many songs Gabriel can add**

- Gabriel also has 20 songs but he has only enough space for 100 songs in total.

\[ \text{Songs per player} = 100 \]

Since Gabriel has 20 songs:

\[ \text{Additional songs Gabriel can have} = \text{Songs per player} - \text{Gabriel's current songs} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Additional songs Gabriel can have} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs to his player.

**Step 4: Find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel**

\[ \text{Difference in additional songs} = \text{Gabriel's additional songs} - \text{Luri's additional songs} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Difference in additional songs} = 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many oranges were picked:**
   - They picked 60 oranges.

2. **Calculate how many oranges Stetson ate:**
   - Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges.
   - To find out how many oranges he ate, we multiply \( \frac{2}{5} \) by 60.
     \[
     \text{Oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money Stetson gives up:**
   - He gives up $10 for each orange he eats.
   - Since he ate 24 oranges, he gives up:
     \[
     \text{Money given up} = 24 \times 10 = \$240

To determine the cost of Jillian's handbag, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the relationship between the handbag cost and the shoes cost:**
   - The statement says that ""her handbag! cost $20; less, than 3 times as much as"" her shoes cost.
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Handbag Cost} = 3 \times (\text{Shoes Cost}) - \$20
     \]

2. **Substitute the given value for the shoes cost into the equation:**
   - Given that the shoes cost $80, substitute \( \$80 \) for the shoes cost in the equation:
     \[
     \text{Handbag Cost} = 3 \times \$80 - \$20
     \]

3. **Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first (according to order of operations):**
   - Perform multiplication:
     \[

To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance James runs in one day**

James runs 12 miles per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week**

Since he runs 5 days a week, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Total weekly distance} = \text{Daily distance} \times \text{Number of days} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Total weekly distance} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly distance} = 60 \text{ miles/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time spent running**

We know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how long he spends running in total, we divide the total distance by his running speed:

\[ \text{Total time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Total time (hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Total time (hours)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: 6 hours.<|im_end|>","He runs 5*12=<<5*12=60>>60 miles a week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we'll break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed daily:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - There are 4 horses.
   - Each horse eats twice a day (morning and evening).
   
   Daily oat consumption per horse = 5 pounds/meal * 2 meals/day = 10 pounds/day.
   
   Total daily oat consumption for all horses = 10 pounds/horse * 4 horses = 40 pounds/day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days:**
   - Five days * 40 pounds/day = 200 pounds.

3. **Determine the number of bags required:**
   - Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats.
   - To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total amount of oats required by the amount in one bag.
   
   Number of bags needed = Total pounds of oats / Pounds per bag = 200 pounds / 50 pounds/bag = 4 bags.

Therefore, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days. The final answer is {The final answer is} 4 bags.<|im_end|>","The four horses can consume 4 x 5 pounds = <<4*5=20>>20 pounds of oats per meal.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many puppies are Pomeranians.
2. Calculate how many of those Pomeranians are girls.

Let's start with the first step.

### Step 1: Determine how many puppies are Pomeranians

Jana has a total of 27 puppies. We know that two-thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians. So, we can calculate the number of Pomeranian puppies as follows:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Number of Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{2 \times 27}{3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18
\]

So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies.

### Step 2: Calculate how many of the Pomeranians are girls

We know that one-third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls. So, we can calculate the number of girl Pomeranians as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Number of girl Pomeranian puppies} = \frac{1 \times 18}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranian puppies.

To find the average highest temperature among the three countries, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum the highest temperatures** from all three countries.
2. **Divide the total sum by the number of countries (which is 3)**.

Let's go through this process step-by-step:

### Step 1: Sum the highest temperatures
- Southlandia: -48°F
- Northlandia: 21°F
- Midlandia: -3°F

Now, add these values together:
\[
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -20
\]

So, the total sum of the highest temperatures is \(-20\) degrees Fahrenheit.

### Step 2: Divide the total sum by the number of countries
There are 3 countries, so divide the total sum by 3:
\[
\frac{-20}{3} \approx -6.67

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Jaime actually has:**
   - Jaime has 64 eggs.

3. **Subtract the number of eggs that fit in the trays from the total number of eggs:**
   - The number of eggs not placed on the trays is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the large pizza:**
   - We know that the small pizza costs $8.
   - The large pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.

2. **Calculate the cost of the large pizza:**
   - Since the large pizza costs 3 times the small pizza, we multiply the small pizza cost by 3.
   \[
   \text{Cost of large pizza} = 3 \times \$8 = \$24
   \]

3. **Add the costs together:**
   - Sally buys both the small and large pizzas.
   - Therefore, we add the cost of the small pizza to the cost of the large pizza.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$8 + \$24 = \$32
   \]

**Final Answer:** Sally spends a total of $\boxed{32}$ on her purchase.<|im_end|>","The cost of the family-size pizza is 3 x $8 = $<<3*8=24>>24.
Therefore, Sally spends $8 + $24 = $<<8+24=32>>32 in all.

                    question:
                    Heather's razors , come 4 . to a pack and cost : $4.00 a pack. ;  , They are currently on sale ? for buy one get one free.  She also has a $2.00 coupon.  How much will each individual ! razor cost, in cents, after ; the discount if she buys 2 ! packs of razors?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much each individual razor costs after the discount, let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost without any discounts:**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - If she buys 2 packs, the total cost would be \(2 \times \$4.00 = \$8.00\).

2. **Apply the Buy One Get One Free (BOGO) promotion:**
   - With the BOGO promotion, she only pays for one razor from every two razors purchased.
   - For 2 packs, she can choose 1 razor from each pack, effectively paying for just half of the total number of razors.
   
3. **Determine the number of razors per pack and the total number of razors:**
   - Since there are 2 packs, and she chooses 1 razor from each, she gets 2 razors for the price of 1 pack.
   - The total number of razors is still 2 razors per pack times 2 packs, which equals 4 razors.

4. **Calculate the new total cost after applying the BOGO promotion:**
   - After the promotion, the effective cost for 2 razors remains at the original price of $4.00 per pack.
   - Therefore, the new total cost for 2 razors is $4.00.

5. **Subtract the coupon value:**
   - She has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract that amount from the total cost of the 2 razors.
   - $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 remaining.

6. **Convert the remaining amount to cents:**
   - Since $2.00 is equivalent to 200 cents, each individual razor now costs 200/4 = 50 cents.

Therefore, after all discounts, including the BOGO promotion and the coupon, each individual razor will cost her 50 cents. 

{The final answer is} 50 cents.<|im_end|>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the human pyramid based on the given information about the cheerleaders' heights.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the total number of cheerleaders:**
   - There are 10 cheerleaders in total.

2. **Determine the number of cheerleaders involved in the pyramid:**
   - 4 cheerleaders are on the bottom.
   - 3 cheerleaders stand on top of the 4.
   - 2 more cheerleaders stand on top of the 3.

3. **Calculate the total number of cheerleaders used in the pyramid:**
   - Bottom layer (4 cheerleaders) + Middle layer (3 cheerleaders) + Top layer (2 cheerleaders) = 9 cheerleaders.

4. **Given that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, calculate the total height of the pyramid:**
   - Since all 9 cheerleaders are assumed to be 64 inches tall, the total height of the pyramid would be \(9 \times 64\) inches.

5. **Convert the total height from inches to feet:**
   - \(9 \times 64\) inches = \(576\) inches.
   - Convert inches to feet: \(576\) inches ÷ \(12\) inches/foot = \(48\) feet.

6. **Consider the position of the tallest cheerleader in the pyramid:**
   - The tallest cheerleader is at the top, which means she has no one standing on her.
   - Therefore, the tallest cheerleader does not contribute to the overall height calculation for the pyramid.

### Conclusion:
Since the tallest cheerleader does not affect the overall height of the pyramid when considering the structure of the pyramid, the calculated height remains the same as previously determined.

**Final Answer:** 
{The final answer is} 48 feet.<|im_end|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks over 5 days based on her walking schedule.

1. **Determine the daily walking duration:**
   - Charisma walks for 5 minutes every hour.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Minutes per day} = 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Minutes per day} = 120 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total walking time over 5 days:**
   - Since Charisma walks for 120 minutes each day, we multiply this by 5 days.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Total minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total minutes} = 600 \text{ minutes}

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let \( A \) represent Angela's current age.

Step 2: Write down the relationship between their ages in four years.
Brett will be 18 years old in four years (since he is currently 14). Angela will be \( A + 4 \) years old in four years.

Step 3: Express the condition that Angela will be three times as old as Brett.
According to the problem, Angela will be three times as old as Brett in four years. This can be written as:
\[ A + 4 = 3 \times 18 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( A \).
First, calculate \( 3 \times 18 \):
\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]
So,
\[ A + 4 = 54 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate \( A \):
\[ A = 54 - 4 \]
\[ A = 50 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently **50** years old. The final answer is:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of rides per day.
- Paul drives twice a day (morning and afternoon).
- He does this for 14 days.

Total number of rides per day = 2 (morning) + 2 (afternoon) = 4 rides/day.

Total number of rides per week = 4 rides/day × 7 days/week = 28 rides/week.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of rides over two weeks.
Total number of rides over two weeks = 28 rides/week × 2 weeks = 56 rides.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of morning rides.
Cost of one morning ride = approximately $6.
Number of morning rides per week = 4.
Total cost for morning rides = 4 rides/week × $6/rider = $24/week.

Since there are two weeks, the total cost for morning rides = $24/week × 2 weeks = $48.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of afternoon rides.
Cost of one afternoon ride = approximately $2.
Number of afternoon rides per week = 4.
Total cost for afternoon rides = 4 rides/week × $2/ride = $8/week.

Since there are two weeks, the total cost for afternoon rides = $8/week × 2 weeks = $16.

### Step 5: Add up all costs to get the total amount spent.
Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides = $48 + $16 = $64.

Therefore, Paul spent a total of $64 on driving his car during these two weeks. 

{The final answer is} $64.<|im_end|>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.

   - Ashley's oranges:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges per box} = 50 \text{ oranges}
     \]
   - Brianne's oranges:
     \[
     Ashley's \; oranges + 20 \text{ more oranges} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pies they can make based on the requirement for one pie:**
   - One Greek orange pie requires 3 oranges.
   - Calculate how many pies they can make from their combined total of 120 oranges (since they have 120 oranges in total):
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges per pie}} = 40 \text{ pies}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of attendees at which both venues would have the same total cost.

Let's define:
- \( n \) as the number of guests.
- \( C_1 \) as the total cost at the first venue.
- \( C_2 \) as the total cost at the second venue.

### Step-by-step solution:

1. **First Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - Flat fee = $200
   - Per person charge = $25 (but no additional cost for food)
   
   Therefore, the total cost \( C_1 \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   C_1 = 200 + 25n
   \]

2. **Second Venue Cost Calculation:**
   - Food cost per person = $5
   - Total cost includes food for all guests
   
   Therefore, the total cost \( C_2 \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   C_2 = 25n + 5n^2
   \]
   Here, \( 5n \) represents the food cost for \( n \) people.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   We want \( C_1 \) to be equal to \( C_2 \):
   \[
   200 + 25n = 25n + 5n^2
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   Subtract \( 25n \) from both sides:
   \[
   200 = 5n^2
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   40 = n^2
   \]
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   n = \sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10}
   \]

6. **Calculate the value:**
   \[
   n \approx 2 \times 3.162 = 6.324
   \]

Since the number of guests must be an integer, we round up or down depending on whether it's closer to 6 or 7.

**Final Answer:** 
Mark needs approximately 7 guests for the two venues to have the same total cost.<|im_end|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many insects each person found based on the given relationships between their insect collections.

Let's define the number of insects found by David as \( D \).

1. **Determine the number of insects found by Bodhi:**
   According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found.
   Therefore, if \( D \) is the number of insects David found, then Bodhi found \( \frac{D}{2} \) insects.

2. **Determine the number of insects found by Lily:**
   Lily found 7 more insects than David.
   Since David found \( D \) insects, Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.

3. **Set up the total number of insects equation:**
   The total number of insects found by all three individuals together is 43.
   So, we can write the equation:
   \[
   (D + 7) + D + \left(\frac{D}{2}\right) = 43
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   D + 7 + D + \frac{D}{2} = 43
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   2D + 7 + \frac{D}{2} = 43
   \]

5. **Eliminate the fraction by finding a common denominator:**
   Multiply every term by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   2(2D + 7) + D = 86
   \]
   Distribute the 2:
   \[
   4D + 14 + D = 86
   \]

6. **Combine like terms again:**
   Combine \( D \) and \( 4D \):
   \[
   5D + 14 = 86
   \]

7. **Isolate \( D \):**
   Subtract 14 from both sides:
   \[
   5D = 72
   \]
   Divide by 5:
   \[
   D = 14.4
   \]

8. **Calculate the number of insects found by Bodhi:**
   \[
   \text{Bodhi's insects} = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{14.4}{2} = 7.2
   \]

9. **Calculate the number of insects found by Lily:**
   \[
   \text{Lily's insects} = D + 7 = 14.4 + 7 = 21.4

Thus, Lily found \( 21.4 \) insects.

- The grandmother used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein.
- Again, we know there are 364 yards in one skein.

So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Yarn used by grandmother} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 \text{ yards}
\]

\[
= \frac{364}{2} \text{ yards}
\]

\[
= 182 \text{ yards}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of yarn used**

We need to add the yarn used by both Mariah and her grandmother:

\[
\text{Total yarn used} = \text{Yarn used by Mariah} + \text{Yarn used by grandmother}
\]

\[
= 91 \text{ yards} + 182 \text{ yards}
\]

\[
= 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is}. 273 yards of yarn were used altogether.<|im_end|>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.
Now that there are common denominators, we can add the 1/4 skein of yarn Mariah used + 2/4 skein of yarn her grandma used = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.
3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Part 1: Calculate the number of gifts needed for each friend's wish list.
- **Cherrie’s friends who want 5 gifts each**: 
  - Number of such friends = 2
  - Gifts required per friend = 5
  - Total gifts for these friends = \(2 \times 5 = 10\)

- **Cherrie’s friends who want 2 gifts each**:
  - Number of such friends = 3
  - Gifts required per friend = 2
  - Total gifts for these friends = \(3 \times 2 = 6\)

#### Summarize the total number of gifts needed so far:
- Total gifts needed = \(10 + 6 = 16\)

#### Part 2: Add the additional 10 gifts bought as a surprise.
- Additional gifts bought = 10

#### Final Calculation:
- Total gifts bought = \(16 + 10 = 26\)

### Conclusion:
Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.

{The final answer is} The final answer is 26.<|im_end|>","Two of Cherries friends in total want 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 gifts.

<|im_start|>header
To determine how long the couch is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the width of the rug:**
   - We know that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - The chair is 3 feet wide.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug = \( 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Calculate the length of the couch:**
   - The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - Twice the width of the rug = \( 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \).
   - Therefore, the length of the couch = \( 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \).

**Final Answer:** The couch is 18 feet long.<|im_end|>","Chair = <<3=3>>3 feet

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per pack of strawberry gum. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total amount spent**: Suzie spent a total of $7 on different types of gum.
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \$7
   \]

2. **Amount spent on grape gum**:
   Suzie bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on grape gum} = \$2
   \]

3. **Amount spent on green apple gum**:
   The price of the green apple gum pack is half what she paid for grape gum.
   \[
   \text{Price of green apple gum pack} = \frac{\$2}{2} = \$1
   \]
   
4. **Amount spent on strawberry gum**:
   We know the total amount spent minus the amounts already accounted for equals the amount spent on strawberry gum.
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on strawberry gum} = \text{Total amount} - (\text{Amount spent on grape gum} + \text{Amount spent on green apple gum})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on strawberry gum} = \$7 - (\$2 + \$1) = \$7 - \$3 = \$4
   \]

5. **Number of strawberry gum packs**:
   Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total. Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, the remaining packs must be other flavors (strawberry and grape).
   \[
   \text{Number of strawberry gum packs} = 2
   \]

6. **Cost per pack of strawberry gum**:
   To find the cost per pack of strawberry gum, divide the total amount spent on strawberry gum by the number of packs.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of strawberry gum} = \frac{\$4}{2} = \$2
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]<|im_end|>","The green apple gum cost half as much as the $2 grape gum, so it cost 2 / 2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to calculate the total number of popsicle sticks he can obtain from both types of wood pieces and then check which type of wood gives him the maximum number of popsicle sticks.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of popsicle sticks per unit length for each type of wood.
- For the 2x4 piece (wood):
  - Length = 2 units
  - Width = 4 units
  - Number of popsicle sticks per unit length = 4 units / 2 units = 2 sticks per unit length

- For the 2x8 piece (wood):
  - Length = 2 units
  - Width = 8 units
  - Number of popsicle sticks per unit length = 8 units / 2 units = 4 sticks per unit length

### Step 2: Determine how much wood Frederick needs for each type of stick.
- To make one popsicle stick using the 2x4 piece:
  - Wood needed = 1/2 stick / stick = 0.5 sticks
  - Cost of wood = 0.5 sticks * $4 = $2

- To make one popsicle stick using the 2x8 piece:
  - Wood needed = 1/2 stick / stick = 0.5 sticks
  - Cost of wood = 0.5 sticks * $6 = $3

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for each type of wood.
- Total cost for 200 sticks from the 2x4 piece:
  - Number of sticks = 200 sticks
  - Cost per stick = $2
  - Total cost = 200 sticks * $2 = $400

- Total cost for 400 sticks from the 2x8 piece:
  - Number of sticks = 400 sticks
  - Cost per stick = $3
  - Total cost = 400 sticks * $3 = $1200

### Step 4: Determine the total amount Frederick has to spend on wood.
- Total budget = $24

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining budget after buying the cheapest wood.
- Remaining budget after buying the cheapest wood:
  - Remaining budget = Total budget - Minimum cost of wood
  - Minimum cost of wood = Minimum of ($2 or $3)
  - Since $2 < $3, minimum cost is $2
  - Remaining budget = $24 - $2 = $22

### Step 6: Determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make based on the remaining budget.
- Number of sticks that can be made = Remaining budget / Cost per stick
- Cost per stick = Minimum of ($2 or $3) = $2
- Number of sticks = $22 / $2 = 11 sticks

Therefore, Frederick can make **11** popsicle sticks given the remaining budget.

The final answer is: The final answer is 11.<|im_end|>","He can buy six 2 x 4's because 24 / 4 = <<24/4=6>>6

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed:**
   - Mario has 6 sled dogs.
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Since snowshoes are designed for two legs (one on each side), we divide the number of legs by 2.

\[
\text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \frac{\text{Total number of legs}}{2}
\]

\[
\text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \frac{6 \times 4}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
\]

So, Mario needs 12 pairs of snowshoes.

2. **Determine the cost per pair of snowshoes:**
   - The cost for one pair of snowshoes is given as $12.00.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all pairs of snowshoes:**
   - Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 12.00 = 144.00

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost if Janet buys individual tickets.
2. Calculate the total cost if she buys a weekly bus pass.
3. Find the difference between the two amounts.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost if Janet buys individual tickets.

- Number of buses per day: 5
- Number of days in a week: 7
- Cost per ticket: $2.20

Total number of trips = (Number of buses per day) * (Number of days in a week)
= 5 * 7
= 35 trips

Total cost without a pass = Total number of trips * Cost per ticket
= 35 * $2.20

Step 2: Calculate the total cost if she buys a weekly bus pass.

Cost of a weekly pass = $20

Step 3: Find the difference between the two amounts.

Amount saved = Total cost without a pass - Cost of a weekly pass

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cows in the zoo:**
   - We know that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - Therefore, the number of cows in the zoo = \(30 \times 2 = 60\).

2. **Verify the number of sheep in the zoo:**
   - The problem states that the zoo has 20 sheep.
   - This information is already given, so we don't need to calculate anything further for the zoo's sheep count.

3. **Calculate the total number of animals on the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of sheep on the farm.
   - According to the problem, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo.
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - Therefore, \(x = \frac{20}{2} = 10\).
   - So, the farm has 30 cows + 10 sheep = 40 animals on the farm.

4. **Calculate the total number of animals at the zoo:**
   - The zoo has 60 cows (from step 1) and 20 sheep.
   - Therefore, the total number of animals at the zoo = \(60 + 20 = 80\).

5. **Combine the totals from both farms/zoo:**
   - Farm: 40 animals
   - Zoo: 80 animals
   - Combined total = \(40 + 80 = 120\).

Therefore, the final answer is: The farm and zoo together have 120 animals.<|im_end|>","The zoo has 2 * 30 cows = <<2*30=60>>60 cows.

   - The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
   - According to the ratio, \( 4x = 12 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of days between today (December 31st) and Andy's birthday (July 19th), and then determine the daily calorie deficit required to achieve the desired weight loss.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th

First, let's count the number of days in each month:

- **December**: There are 31 days.
- **January**: 31 - 31 = 0 days left until July.
- **February**: 28 days.
- **March**: 31 days.
- **April**: 30 days.
- **May**: 31 days.
- **June**: 19 days (up to the date).

Now summing up these days:

\[ \text{Total days} = 31 (\text{Dec}) + 0 (\text{Jan}) + 28 (\text{Feb}) + 31 (\text{Mar}) + 30 (\text{Apr}) + 31 (\text{May}) + 19 (\text{Jun}) = 169 \text{ days} \]

So, there are 169 days between December 31st and July 19th.

### Step 2: Determine the total calorie deficit needed to lose 30 pounds

Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. Therefore, for 30 pounds:

\[ \text{Calories to lose 30 pounds} = 30 \times 3500 = 105,000 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the average daily calorie deficit

Divide the total calorie deficit by the total number of days:

\[ \text{Average daily calorie deficit} = \frac{105,000}{169} \approx 6,174.18 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs an average daily calorie deficit of approximately \( 6,174.18 \) calories to meet his goal of losing 30 pounds by his birthday.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6,174.18}
\]<|im_end|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for an entire week and spending a certain amount in total.

Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from working.
Gerald earns $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:

Total earnings = Daily wage × Number of days
Total earnings = $30 × 7
Total earnings = $210

Step 2: Determine the remaining amount after expenses.
We know that Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total expenses from his total earnings:

Remaining amount = Total earnings - Expenses
Remaining amount = $210 - $100
Remaining amount = $110

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: $110<|im_end|>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah runs:**
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - She runs 8 laps.

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance per Lap} \times \text{Number of Laps}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} \times 8 \, \text{laps}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 2 \, \text{km}
\]

2. **Convert the total distance from kilometers to meters (since 1 km = 1000 m):**

\[
\text{Total Distance in Meters} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 1000 \, \text{m/km}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance in Meters} = 2000 \, \text{m}

3. **Determine the amount of water needed per kilometer based on the given information:**
   - Hannah needs 60 ml of water for every 1 km she runs.

\[
\text{Water Needed per Kilometer} = 60 \, \text{ml}
\]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water Hannah needs:**

\[
\text{Total Water Needed} = \text{Water Needed per Kilometer} \times \text{Total Distance in Meters}
\]

\[
\text{Total Water Needed} = 60 \, \text{ml/km} \times 2000 \, \text{m}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how much Julie spent on clothes:**
   - Julie initially has $500.
   - She spends 20% of her total amount on clothes.

\[
\text{Amount spent on clothes} = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

2. **Determine the remaining money after buying clothes:**

\[
\text{Remaining money after clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. **Calculate how much she spent on CDs:**
   - After buying clothes, she has $400 left.
   - She spends 25% of this remaining amount on CDs.

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the house based on the given information.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define two variables:
- \( H \) represents the cost of the house.
- \( L \) represents the cost of the lot.

From the problem statement, we know that:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot:
\[ H = 3L \]

### Step 2: Substitute the Expression for \( H \)
Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( L \)
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

### Step 5: Find \( H \)
Now that we have \( L \), substitute it back into the expression for \( H \):
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the house costs:
\[
\boxed{90,000}
\]<|im_end|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags:**
   - Tara sells each bag for $8.
   - She has 8 bags.

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 8 \times \$8 = \$64
   \]

3. **Determine the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total duration of one round:**
   - Each round lasts for 3 minutes.
   - There are 5 rounds in total.

\[
\text{Duration of one round} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

2. **Calculate the total duration of all rounds:**

\[
\text{Total duration of all rounds} = 5 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Convert the total duration from minutes to seconds:**
   
\[
1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}
\]
\[
15 \text{ minutes} = 15 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 900 \text{ seconds}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Kelsie made based on the information given about the number of cookies Suzanne made.

1. First, let's find out how many cookies Josh made.
   - We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies.
   - Josh made one-fourth as many cookies as Suzanne.
   \[
   \text{Cookies Josh made} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Cookies Suzanne made}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Ali has initially.

- Ali has four $10 bills: \(4 \times \$10 = \$40\).
- He also has six $20 bills: \(6 \times \$20 = \$120\).

So, the initial total amount of money Ali has is:
\[ \$40 + \$120 = \$160 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much Ali gives to his sister.

- Ali gives half of his total money to his sister.
- Half of \$160 is: \(\frac{1}{2} \times \$160 = \$80\).

So, Ali gives his sister \$80.

### Step 3: Subtract the given amount from the initial total.

- After giving away \$80, the remaining amount in Ali's possession is:
\[ \$160 - \$80 = \$80 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how much money Ali spends on dinner.

- Ali spends \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining amount on dinner.
- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of \$80 is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times \$80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = \$48 \]

So, Ali spends \$48 on dinner.

### Step 5: Calculate the final amount of money Ali has left.

- The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:
\[ \$80 - \$48 = \$32 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
{The final answer is} \$32.<|im_end|>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Royce takes to shingle a house given that he takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob.

1. **Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes:**
   Rob takes 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this into minutes as follows:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Double Rob's time:**
   Double Rob's time means multiplying his total time by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Add the extra 40 minutes to double Rob's time:**

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs, we'll calculate the total number of items required for each type and then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Hats:
- Each child requires one hat.
- Total hats needed: \(3 \text{ children} \times 1 \text{ hat/child} = 3 \text{ hats}\).

#### Scarves:
- Each child requires one scarf.
- Total scarves needed: \(3 \text{ children} \times 1 \text{ scarf/child} = 3 \text{ scarves}\).

#### Sweaters:
- Each child requires one sweater.
- Total sweaters needed: \(3 \text{ children} \times 1 \text{ sweater/child} = 3 \text{ sweaters}\).

#### Mittens:
- Each child requires two pairs of mittens.
- Total pairs of mittens needed: \(3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs}\).
- Since each pair uses 1 skein, total mittens needed: \(6 \text{ pairs} \times 1 \text{ skein/pair} = 6 \text{ skeins}\).

#### Socks:
- Each child requires four pairs of socks.
- Total pairs of socks needed: \(3 \text{ children} \times 4 \text{ pairs/child} = 12 \text{ pairs}\).
- Since each pair uses 2 skeins, total socks needed: \(12 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ skeins/pair} = 24 \text{ skeins}\).

### Summing Up All Items Needed:
- Hats: 3
- Scarfs: 3
- Sweaters: 3
- Mittens: 6 (total)
- Socks: 24 (total)

Total number of items needed: 
\[3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 24 = 45\]

Each item has its own requirement in terms of the amount of wool needed per unit. Given that it takes 2 skeins to knit one hat, 4 skeins to knit one scarf, 12 skeins to knit one sweater, 10 skeins to knit one pair of mittens, and 2 skeins to knit one pair of socks, we can now calculate the total number of skeins needed based on the quantity of each item multiplied by the number of items:

- For hats: \(3 \text{ hats} \times 2 \text{ skeins/hat} = 6 \text{ skeins}\)
- For scarfs: \(3 \text{ scarfs} \times 4 \text{ skeins/scarf} = 12 \text{ skeins}\)
- For sweaters: \(3 \text{ sweaters} \times 12 \text{ skeins/sweater} = 36 \text{ skeins}\)

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of quarts each person can pick per hour and then sum them up.

1. **Tony's Rate:**
   - Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.
   
2. **Bobby's Rate:**
   - Bobby picks one less quart per hour than Tony.
     \[
     \text{Bobby's rate} = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

3. **Kathy's Rate:**
   - Kathy picks twice as many quarts per hour as Bobby.
     \[
     \text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts per hour}

4. **Ricky's Rate:**
   - Ricky picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy.
     \[
     \text{Ricky's rate} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts per hour}

Now, let's add up all their rates:

\[
\text{Total rate} = \text{Tony's rate} + \text{Bobby's rate} + \text{Kathy's rate} + \text{Ricky's rate}
\]
\[
\text{Total rate} = 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts per hour}

To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rows for red tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 6 red tulips in one row.
   - He has 36 red tulips.

\[
\text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total red tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
\]

2. **Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips:**
   - Jackson can fit 8 blue tulips in one row.
   - He has 24 blue tulips.

\[
\text{Number of rows} = \frac{\text{Total blue tulips}}{\text{Tulips per row}} = \frac{24}{8} = 3

3. **Combine the number of rows for both colors:**

\[
\text{Total number of rows} = \text{Number of rows for red tulips} + \text{Number of rows for blue tulips}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of batches Heather can make:**
   - We know that one batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.
   - The total amount of raisins available is 27 cups.

2. **Calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make:**
   - Since one batch uses \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins, we divide the total amount of raisins by the amount needed per batch.
     \[
     \text{Number of batches of oatmeal cookies} = \frac{\text{Total raisins}}{\text{Raisins per batch}} = \frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}}
     \]
   - To simplify division by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal:
     \[
     \frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3}
     \]
     \[
     27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 9 \times 4 = 36
     \]

3. **Verify the remaining raisins after making oatmeal cookies:**
   - After making 36 batches of oatmeal cookies, we calculate the remaining raisins:
     \[
     \text{Remaining raisins} = \text{Initial raisins} - (\text{Batches} \times \text{Raisins per batch})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining raisins} = 27 - (36 \times \frac{3}{4})
     \]
     \[
     27 - 27 = 0
     \]
   - There should be no raisins left over because the initial quantity matches exactly the amount used for the batches.

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies using the entire bag of raisins.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 36.<|im_end|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                    question:
                    Ada's daily , electric consumption is 12 kilowatts . per hour. She ! is ; planning : to add a : device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. : If ? a kilowatt per ? hour . is , $1.50, ; how much . is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after ! she adds the new device?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate two things:

1. The total electricity usage for Ada in one week.
2. The cost of her electricity usage.

Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's daily electricity usage
Ada consumes 12 kilowatts (kW) of electricity per hour.

- **Daily Usage**: \(12 \text{ kW}\)

### Step 2: Calculate Ada's weekly electricity usage
There are 7 days in a week.

- **Weekly Usage** = Daily Usage × Number of Days in a Week
\[ Weekly Usage = 12 \text{ kW/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \]

First, multiply these values:
\[ Weekly Usage = 12 \times 24 = 288 \text{ kW} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of Ada's current weekly electricity usage
Given that the cost per kilowatt-hour is $1.50, we can find the total cost as follows:

- **Total Cost Before Adding Device**:
\[ Total Cost = Weekly Usage \times Cost Per kWh \]
\[ Total Cost = 288 \text{ kW} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ Total Cost = 288 \times 1.50 = \$432 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of adding the new device
If the new device consumes 2 kW per hour, then its daily usage would be:

- **Device Daily Usage**: \(2 \text{ kW}\)

The number of days in a week is still 24.

- **Device Weekly Usage**: 
\[ Device Weekly Usage = 2 \text{ kW/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \]

Perform the calculation:
\[ Device Weekly Usage = 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ kW} \]

Next, calculate the cost associated with the new device’s usage:
\[ New Total Cost = Device Weekly Usage \times Cost Per kWh \]
\[ New Total Cost = 48 \text{ kW} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ New Total Cost = 48 \times 1.50 = \$72 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in cost between before and after adding the device
Finally, subtract the original weekly cost from the new total cost:

- **Cost Difference**:
\[ Cost Difference = Original Total Cost - New Total Cost \]
\[ Cost Difference = \$432 - \$72 \]

Now, perform the subtraction:
\[ Cost Difference = 432 - 72 = \$360 \]

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
{The final answer is} \$360.<|im_end|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the work rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person paints at a rate of \( \frac{1}{2} \) house per 5 days.

2. **Calculate the total amount of work done by all five people in one day:**
   - Since one person works at a rate of \( \frac{1}{2} \) house per 5 days, five people will work at a combined rate of \( 5 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \) houses per 5 days.
   - Simplifying, we get \( \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \) houses per 5 days.

3. **Convert the daily work rate to an hourly rate:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, the number of hours required for one person to paint one house (which takes 5 days) is \( \frac{24}{5} \) hours.
   - For five people working together, since they complete twice as much work in the same time period (since they have double the capacity), they would also need \( \frac{24}{5} \) hours to complete their portion of painting.

Therefore, the final answer is that it would take 5 people \( \frac{24}{5} \) hours to paint one whole house.<|im_end|>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.

   - Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia,
     \[
     \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has}
     \]
     Substituting Ophelia's number of sofas (20):
     \[
     \text{Number of sofas Jenna has} = 3 \times 20 = 60
     \]

3. **Determine the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas, which means she also has twice as many chairs as sofas because each sofa represents two chairs.
     \[
     \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has} = 2 \times \text{Number of sofas Ophelia has}
     \]
     Substituting Ophelia's number of sofas (20):

4. **Calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia,
     \[
     \text{Number of chairs Jenna has} = 3 \times \text{Number of chairs Ophelia has}

   - He also bought a headphone set that costs an unknown amount (let's call this cost \(x\)).
   - The total amount he paid is $48.

2. **Set up an equation based on the total payment:**
   \[
   4 + x = 48
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\) (the cost of the headphone set):**
   \[
   x = 48 - 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 44
   \]

So, the headphone set costs $44.

4. **Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought without buying the headphone set:**
   - Since he already bought 1 CD at $4, we need to find out how much money he has left after buying one CD.
   - Money left after buying 1 CD: 
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44
     \]

5. **Determine how many more CDs he could have bought with his remaining $44:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - Number of additional CDs he could have bought: 
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11
     \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is 11}.<|im_end|>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.
That means, for that money Tom would be able to buy 44 / 4 = <<44/4=11>>11 more CDs.

To determine the total number of hours Josh has spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to consider all the different amounts of time he worked during those weeks.

1. **Identify the regular weekly work:**
   - Josh worked 4 hours per week for 7 full weeks (since he didn't spend any extra hours beyond these 7 weeks).
   \[
   4 \text{ hours/week} \times 7 \text{ weeks} = 28 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Consider the extra weeks:**
   - He spent 5 hours each week for two consecutive weeks.
   \[
   5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total hours for the remaining weeks:**
   - The remaining weeks are 8 - 7 = 1 week.
   \[
   6 \text{ hours/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Sum up all the hours:**
   \[
   28 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 44 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is \( \boxed{44 } \) hours.<|im_end|>","For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of passengers on the bus**

We start with 48 people.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of passengers getting off at the first stop**

According to the problem, 8 passengers get off at the first stop.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of passengers getting on at the first stop**

At the first stop, 5 times the number that got off (which was 8) get on. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) passengers get on.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of passengers remaining after the first stop**

After the first stop, the number of passengers left is \(48 - 8 + 40 = 70\).

**Step 5: Calculate the number of passengers getting off at the second stop**

At the second stop, 21 passengers get off.

**Step 6: Calculate the number of passengers getting on at the second stop**

At the second stop, 3 times fewer than those who got off in the first stop get on. Since 21 got off in the first stop, 3 times fewer means only one-third of them do. Therefore, \(21 / 3 = 7\) passengers get on.

**Step 7: Calculate the total number of passengers remaining after the second stop**

After the second stop, the number of passengers left is \(70 - 21 + 7 = 56\).

So, the final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is **56**.<|im_end|>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.

At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, he is currently \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Define variables for the ages:**
   - Let \(x\) represent the number of years that have passed since Jame turned 22.

3. **Set up an equation based on the given information about the cousin's age:**
   - In 8 years from now, the cousin will be \(2 \times (Jame's current age) + 5\).
   - The cousin's age at that time can also be expressed as \(22 + x + 8\).

4. **Equate the two expressions to find \(x\):**
   \[
   22 + x + 8 = 2(22) + 5
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   22 + x + 8 = 44 + 5
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   22 + x + 8 = 59
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   22 + x + 8 = 59
   \]
   Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 59 - 30
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 29
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of years between the two people’s ages:**
   - Since 29 years have passed, the number of years that separate their ages is \(29\).

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{29}\).<|im_end|>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( C \) represent the cost of the computer.
Let \( M \) represent the cost of one monitor.
Let \( P \) represent the cost of the printer.

Given information:
- The total amount spent on all items is $2,400.
- Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.
- The computer costs $1,100.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
From the given information, we can set up two equations:

1. The total cost equation:
\[ C + M + P = 2400 \]

2. The relationship between the computer and printer costs:
\[ P = C - 400 \]

### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
We know that the computer costs $1,100 (\(C = 1100\)) and substitute this into the second equation to find the printer cost (\(P\)):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 \]
\[ P = 700 \]

Now, substitute both \(C\) and \(P\) into the total cost equation to verify or find the monitor cost:
\[ 1100 + M + 700 = 2400 \]

Simplify this equation to find \(M\):
\[ 1800 + M = 2400 \]
\[ M = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ M = 600 \]

### Final Answer:
One monitor costs **$600** in dollars.<|im_end|>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.
He paid 2400-1100-700=<<2400-1100-700=600>>600 dollars for the monitors.
Each monitor costs 600/2=<<600/2=300>>300 dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Boys collected 60 seashells.
   
2. **Calculate the number of seashells collected by girls:**
   - Each girl collects an amount equal to the sum of the shells collected by boys plus four times that amount.
   - Let's denote the number of seashells collected by each girl as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, the total collection from the girls should be equal to the sum of the shells collected by the boys plus four times that amount.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Since there are 20 children in total (10 girls and 10 boys), if each girl collects \( x \) seashells, the total number of seashells collected by the girls would be \( 20x \).

4. **Formulate the relationship between the total collection from the boys and girls:**
   - The total collection from the boys is given as 60 seashells.
   - Therefore, \( 20x = 60 + 4 \times 60 \)

5. **Solve the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     20x = 60 + 240
     \]
     \[
     20x = 300

6. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 20:
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 15

   So, my wife would like to pay $25.

3. **Calculate the additional 20% tip:**
   - The tip amount is 20% of the bill.
   - Calculate 20% of $50:
     \[
     0.20 \times 50 = 10
     \]
So, the additional tip amounts to $10.

4. **Subtract the contribution from my wife from the bill amount:**
   - Subtract the tip from the bill amount:
     \[
     50 - 10 = 40
     \]

5. **Add back the tip amount to see how much I ended up paying in total:**
   - Add the tip back to the remaining amount after my wife's contribution:
     \[
     40 + 10 = 50
     \]

Therefore, the final amount you ended up paying is $\boxed{50}$.<|im_end|>","If the total bill is $50, the total tip of 20% would be $50*20% = $<<50*20*.01=10>>10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much each boy originally gets.
- There are three boys sharing $18 equally.
\[ \text{Amount each boy gets} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \]

So, each boy initially gets $6.

### Step 2: Calculate the additional amounts added by each boy.
- Eldest son adds $5 to his share.
\[ \text{Eldest's new share} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]
- Second son adds an additional $10.
\[ \text{Second's new share} = 6 + 10 = 16 \]
- Third son doesn't add any extra money yet.

### Step 3: Find out the total before spending money.
Since they all got their shares, the total sum is already $18.

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining balance after spending $8.
After spending $8 on something, the remaining balance is:
\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 18 - 8 = 10 \]

### Step 5: Triple the remaining balance.
Triple the remaining balance gives us:
\[ \text{Tripled amount} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the final amount the eldest son has now is $30.

{The final answer is}. 30<|im_end|>","Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate Elvis's total savings goal for the entire month.
Elvis aims to save $1125 per month. Since there are approximately 30 days in a month, we can assume that his daily savings should be consistent throughout the month.

\[ \text{Daily Savings Goal} = \frac{\$1125}{30} = \$37.50 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many days fall within the first and second halves of the month.
- The number of days in the first half of April (assuming it starts on the 1st) is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- The number of days in the second half of April (starting from the 16th) is also \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save in the first half of April.
Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half compared to the first half, we calculate:

\[ \text{First Half Savings} = 2 \times (\text{Second Half Savings}) \]
\[ \text{Second Half Savings} = \$37.50 \]
\[ \text{First Half Savings} = 2 \times \$37.50 = \$75 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of April.
Given that he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half:

\[ \text{Total Second Half Savings} = \$1125 \]
\[ \text{First Half Savings} = \$75 \]
\[ \text{Second Half Savings} = 2 \times \$75 = \$150 \]

### Step 5: Verify the calculations.
We need to check if the sum of the savings over both halves equals the total savings goal:

\[ \$75 + \$150 = \$225 \]

This calculation seems incorrect because it doesn't match the total savings goal ($1125). Let's correct our approach:

- Since the savings goal is $1125 and he wants to save twice as much in the second half as in the first half, let's denote the first half savings as \( S_1 \) and the second half savings as \( S_2 \):
  
  \[ S_1 = \$S \]
  \[ S_2 = 2 \times S \]

  Given \( S_1 + S_2 = \$1125 \):

  \[ S + 2S = \$1125 \]
  \[ 3S = \$1125 \]
  \[ S = \frac{\$1125}{3} = \$375 \]

So, the first half savings would be \$375 and the second half savings would be \( 2 \times \$375 = \$750 \), which matches the total savings goal.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$375}
\]<|im_end|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought, subtract that from her initial amount of money, and determine the change she receives.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the apples**
- Number of apples = 3
- Cost per apple = $1.50
\[ \text{Total cost of apples} = 3 \times \$1.50 = \$4.50 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the oranges**
- Number of oranges = 5
- Cost per orange = $0.80
\[ \text{Total cost of oranges} = 5 \times \$0.80 = \$4.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the peaches**
- Number of peaches = 6
- Cost per peach = $0.75
\[ \text{Total cost of peaches} = 6 \times \$0.75 = \$4.50 \]

**Step 4: Sum up the costs of all the fruits**
\[ \text{Total cost of all fruits} = \$4.50 (\text{apples}) + \$4.00 (\text{oranges}) + \$4.50 (\text{peaches}) = \$13.00 \]

**Step 5: Subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money**
- Initial amount of money = $20
\[ \text{Change received} = \$20 - \$13.00 = \$7.00 \]

Therefore, Verna's change after purchasing the fruits would be $\boxed{\$7.00}$.<|im_end|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.

1. Calculate the total amount Jairus earns from completing 20 tasks.
2. Calculate the total amount Jenny earns from completing 20 tasks.
3. Find the difference between their earnings.

Step 1: Calculate Jairus's total earnings.
Jairus earns $0.8 per task. Therefore, for 20 tasks:
\[ \text{Total earnings (Jairus)} = 20 \times 0.8 = \$16 \]

Step 2: Calculate Jenny's total earnings.
Jenny also earns $0.5 per task. Therefore, for 20 tasks:
\[ \text{Total earnings (Jenny)} = 20 \times 0.5 = \$10 \]

Step 3: Find the difference in their earnings.
To find out how much more Jairus will earn than Jenny, subtract Jenny's total earnings from Jairus's total earnings:
\[ \text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = \$6 \]

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jeff receives based on his relationship to Brad's share. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives.

### Step 2: Establish the Relationship
Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Therefore, Jeff's share can be represented as \( 4B \).

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
Since they have a total of $100, we can write an equation that represents their combined shares:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( B \)
Divide both sides by 5 to find out how much Brad gets:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

So, Brad receives $20.

### Step 6: Calculate Jeff's Share
Now that we know Brad's share (\( B \)), we can calculate Jeff's share (which is 4 times Brad's share):
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4 \times B \]
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Jeff's share} = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets **$80** in dollars.<|im_end|>","Brad gets 100/5=<<100/5=20>>20 dollars.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total distance Jeff walks in one round trip:**
   - Jeff walks from his home to his workplace.
   - The distance between his home and his workplace is given as 3 miles.

2. **Calculate the number of trips Jeff makes per day:**
   - Each day, Jeff walks to work and then returns home.
   - Therefore, he makes 2 trips per day (one way to work and one way back).

3. **Find out how much Jeff walks each day:**
   - Since he makes 2 trips per day, we multiply the distance of one trip by the number of trips.
     \[
     \text{Distance walked per day} = 3 \text{ miles/trip} \times 2 \text{ trips/day}

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Count**: 
   - Elise starts writing the alphabet.
   - She writes ""it"" in full twice.

2. **First Rewrite**:
   - After her first rewrite, she writes ""!half of it"". This means she rewrote ""it"", but only wrote ""half of it"".

3. **Second Rewrite**:
   - After her second rewrite, she rewrites everything she has already written.
   - Her previous work was ""it"" (twice) and ""!half of it"" (once).

4. **Re-write Everything**:
   - She now rewrites both instances of ""it"".
   - She also rewrites ""!half of it"".

5. **Final Count**:
   - She originally wrote ""it"" 2 times and ""!half of it"" 1 time.
   - Now she needs to count all these instances again.

6. **Calculating Total Letters**:
   - ""it"" = 2 * 5 = 10 (since ""it"" is 5 letters long)
   - ""!half of it"" = 5 + 7 (since ""!half of it"" is 5 letters for ""half"" and 7 for ""of"")
   - Re-writing both ""it""s: 2 * 5 = 10
   - Re-writing ""!half of it"": 2 * 5 = 10

Now let's add them up:

- Original ""it"" letters: 10
- Rewritten ""it"" letters: 10
- Rewritten ""!half of it"" letters: 10

Total number of letters Elise has written:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a phone tree where Ali decides to call 3 families.
   - Each of these families then calls 3 other families.
   - This continues until the fourth round.

2. **Calculating the Number of Families Involved in Each Round:**
   
   - **First Round (Ali):** 
     - Ali makes one call.
     
   - **Second Round (Families called by Ali):**
     - Each of Ali's three families makes another call.
     - Therefore, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) new calls are made.

   - **Third Round (Families called by the second set of callers):**
     - Now, we need to consider that the original 3 families from the first round also make additional calls based on their own members.
     - The total number of families calling now is \(3 + 9 = 12\).
     - So, \(12 \times 3 = 36\) new calls are made.

   - **Fourth Round (Families called by the third set of callers):**
     - Again, considering that the original 3 families from the first round also make additional calls based on their own members.
     - The total number of families calling now is \(12 + 36 = 48\).
     - So, \(48 \times 3 = 144\) new calls are made.

3. **Summing Up All Calls Made Over All Rounds:**
   - Total calls over all rounds can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     1 + 9 + 36 + 144 = 180
     \]

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, a total of **144 families** will be notified.<|im_end|>","In the first round, there are 3 families called.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Mark's initial weight given that he lost 10 pounds per month over a period of 3 months, and his final weight was 70 pounds.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Weight Loss:**
   - Mark loses 10 pounds per month.
   - Over 3 months, the total weight loss can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight Loss} = 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Weight Loss} = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine Initial Weight:**
   - Let \( W \) represent Mark's initial weight.
   - After losing 30 pounds, his final weight is 70 pounds.
   - We set up the equation based on the relationship between his initial and final weights:
     \[
     W - 30 = 70
     \]

3. **Solve for Initial Weight:**
   - Add 30 to both sides of the equation to isolate \( W \):
     \[
     W = 70 + 30
     \]
     \[
     W = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 100 \text{ pounds}}
\]<|im_end|>","Since Mark was losing 10 pounds each month, in 3 months he lost 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 pounds.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine how many toys James has:**
   - According to the problem, James's play set contains 80 toys.

2. **Calculate how many toys Jonathan needs to reach his goal:**
   - The problem states that Jonathan needs 5 times as many toys in his play set as James's.
   - Therefore, if James has 80 toys, then Jonathan needs \(5 \times 80\) toys.

3. **Compute the number of toys Jonathan needs to buy or collect:**
   - \(5 \times 80 = 400\).

4. **Find out how many toys Jonathan currently has:**
   - Let \(x\) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - Since he needs 400 more toys to meet his requirement, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + 400 = 400
     \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Subtract 400 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 400 - 400
     \]
     \[
     x = 0
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Jonathan currently has no toys because he needs 400 more toys to complete his play set according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 0.<|im_end|>","Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost without any discounts.
First, we need to determine how many of each item Daniel wants to buy.

- **Notebooks**: 5
- **Pens**: 2
- **Calculators**: 1
- **Geometry sets**: 1

Each item has its price:
- Notebook: $1.50 each
- Pen: $0.25 each
- Calculator: $12 each
- Geometry set: $10 each

Now, calculate the total cost for each type of item before applying any discounts.

#### Cost Calculation:
- **Notebooks**:
\[ 5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50 \]

- **Pens**:
\[ 2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50 \]

- **Calculator**:
\[ 1 \times \$12 = \$12 \]

- **Geometry set**:
\[ 1 \times \$10 = \$10 \]

Summing these up gives us the total cost before any discounts:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12 + \$10 = \$30 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 10% discount.
Since Daniel gets a 10% discount on all the items, we can calculate the discounted amount as follows:

- Discounted Total Cost = Original Total Cost - (Original Total Cost × Discount Rate)
\[ Discounted Total Cost = \$30 - (\$30 \times 0.10) \]
\[ Discounted Total Cost = \$30 - \$3 \]
\[ Discounted Total Cost = \$27 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Daniel has to spend a total of $\boxed{27}$ dollars on all the items he wants to buy after applying the 10% discount.<|im_end|>","Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50
Two pens cost 2 x $0.25 = $<<2*0.25=0.50>>0.50.
The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.
Thus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.
Therefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered and then determine how much change she gets back after paying with a fifty-dollar bill.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the hamburgers**
- Number of hamburgers: 5
- Cost per hamburger: $4
\[ \text{Total cost for hamburgers} = 5 \times \$4 = \$20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the potato fries**
- Number of packs of potato fries: 10
- Cost per pack of potato fries: $0.30
\[ \text{Total cost for potato fries} = 10 \times \$0.30 = \$3 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fruit drinks**
- Number of cans of fruit drinks: 5
- Cost per can of fruit drink: $2
\[ \text{Total cost for fruit drinks} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10 \]

**Step 4: Add up all the costs to find the total amount spent**
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = \$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33 \]

**Step 5: Subtract the total amount spent from the amount given (one fifty-dollar bill)**
\[ \text{Change received} = \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The change Carly receives is **$17**.<|im_end|>","The cost of 5 hamburgers is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
The cost of 10 packs of potato fries is 10 x $0.30 = $<<10*0.3=3>>3.
And, the cost of 5 cans of fruit drinks is 5 x $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10.
Thus, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $<<20+3+10=33>>33.
Therefore, Carly gets a change of $50 - $33 = $<<50-33=17>>17.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total commission based on the sales value. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the commission for the first $1000 sale
- The base rate of commission is 30%.
- For the first $1000, the commission is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Commission} = \$1000 \times 0.30 = \$300 \]

### Step 2: Determine the commission for the second part of the sales value ($1500)
- After the first $1000, any additional sales beyond that will have an additional 10% commission.
- The remaining sales after the first $1000 are $1500 - $1000 = $500.
- The commission for these $500 sales at 10% is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Additional Commission} = \$500 \times 0.10 = \$50 \]
- Adding the additional commission to the original commission from the first $1000 gives us:
\[ \text{Total Commission} = \$300 + \$50 = \$350 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned is **$350**.

{The final answer is}
The final answer is: $350<|im_end|>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles in the cases:**
   - Bill starts with 2 cases.
   - Each case contains 24 bottles.

\[
2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles}
\]

2. **Determine the total number of guests:**
   - There are 70 guests.

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed per guest:**
   - Bill wants to provide 2 bottles per guest.

\[
2 \text{ bottles per guest} \times 70 \text{ guests} = 140 \text{ bottles}
\]

4. **Find out how many more bottles are needed beyond what he already has:**
   - Subtract the number of bottles he currently has from the total number of bottles needed.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the swimming speed at different temperatures.
- **Cold Water Speed**: 
  - Time taken = 16 minutes for 1 mile.
  - Speed (miles per minute) = \( \frac{1}{16} \).

- **Warm Water Speed**:
  - Time taken = 2 minutes more than twice the time for 1 mile at cold temperature.
  - Twice the time for 1 mile at cold temperature = 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.
  - Warm water takes 2 + 32 = 34 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate the swimming speeds.
- Cold water speed = \( \frac{1}{16} \) miles per minute.
- Warm water speed = \( \frac{1}{34} \) miles per minute.

### Step 3: Determine the time difference between the two swimming conditions.
- Time difference = Warm water time - Cold water time.
- Time difference = 34 - 16 = 18 minutes.

### Step 4: Find out how much longer it takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.
- Cold water distance = 1 mile.
- Hot water distance = 3 miles.
- Time difference for 3 miles = Warm water time - Cold water time.
- Time difference for 3 miles = 34 - 16 = 18 minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 18 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is 18 minutes.<|im_end|>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$2 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$10 \]

#### Calculate Total Weeks Needed:
\[ \text{Total Weeks Needed} = \frac{\text{Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} \]
\[ \text{Total Weeks Needed} = \frac{\$80}{\$10} \]
\[ \text{Total Weeks Needed} = 8 \]

Therefore, it will take John **8 weeks** to save up $80.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many holes there are in total among all the buttons in the bag. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of buttons that have two holes.
- We know there are 21 buttons in total.
- Out of these, seven buttons have two holes.

So, let's calculate the number of buttons that have more than two holes:
- There are \(7\) buttons with exactly two holes.
- The remaining buttons will have either one or three holes (since we can't have a button with more than three holes).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of buttons that have at least one hole.
Since there are \(21\) buttons in total and \(7\) of them have exactly two holes, the remaining buttons must have at least one hole.

Let’s denote:
- \(B_1\) as the number of buttons with one hole.
- \(B_3\) as the number of buttons with three holes.

We know:
\[ B_1 + B_3 = 21 \]

From the information given, we also know:
\[ B_1 + 2 \times 7 = 21 \]
\[ B_1 + 14 = 21 \]
\[ B_1 = 21 - 14 \]
\[ B_1 = 7 \]

This means there are 7 buttons with one hole.

### Step 3: Determine the number of buttons with three holes.
Now, we subtract the number of buttons with one hole from the total number of buttons:
\[ B_3 = 21 - B_1 \]
\[ B_3 = 21 - 7 \]
\[ B_3 = 14 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes.
- Buttons with one hole contribute \(7\) holes.
- Buttons with three holes contribute \(14\) holes.

Therefore, the total number of holes is:
\[ \text{Total holes} = 7 \times 1 + 14 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total holes} = 7 + 42 \]
\[ \text{Total holes} = 49 \]

### Conclusion:
There are **49** holes in total among all the buttons in the bag.

Thus, the final answer is:

To determine how big Peter's locker is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Zack's locker size:**
   - We know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
   - Timothy's locker volume = 24 cubic inches.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker volume} = \frac{\text{Timothy's locker volume}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the given value:
   \[
   \text{Zack's locker volume} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate Peter's locker size:**
   - Peter's locker is one-fourth as big as Zack's locker.
   - Zack's locker volume = 12 cubic inches.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{\text{Zack's locker volume}}{4}
   \]
   Substituting the value found:
   \[
   \text{Peter's locker volume} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ cubic inches}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the amount of coffee Octavia's husband Juan drinks.
2. Calculate the reduction needed from the daily recommendation.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of coffee Juan drinks

- The daily recommended amount of coffee is 4 cups.
- Juan drinks 10 times the amount that Octavia drinks.

Let \( C \) represent the amount of coffee Octavia drinks per day. According to the information given:

\[ C = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup/day (since she drinks half the daily recommended amount)} \]

Now, calculate the amount Juan drinks:

\[ \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times C = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5 \text{ cups/day} \]

So, Juan drinks 5 cups of coffee per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the reduction needed

- The current daily coffee intake for Juan is 5 cups.
- The daily recommended intake should be 4 cups.

Calculate the reduction required:

\[ \text{Reduction needed} = \text{Current intake} - \text{Recommended intake} \]
\[ \text{Reduction needed} = 5 - 4 = 1 \text{ cup/day} \]

Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his daily coffee intake by **1 cup** to meet the recommended daily intake of 4 cups.<|im_end|>","Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups of coffee, Octavia drinks 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 cups
Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, which translates to 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups
Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rodents were present at the pet store based on the information given.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of cages:**
   - The pet store has 6 cages.

2. **Determine the number of cages that contain rodents:**
   - We know that 3 cages have either hamsters or guinea pigs.
   
3. **Calculate the number of cages containing rodents:**
   - Since there are 6 cages in total and 3 of them do not contain any rodents (as they only contain one type of animal), then the remaining cages must contain rodents.
   - Number of cages with rodents = Total cages - Cages without rodents
   - Number of cages with rodents = 6 - 3 = 3 cages.

4. **Calculate the total number of rodents:**
   - We know that the remaining 3 cages contain either hamsters or guinea pigs.
   - Let's denote the number of hamsters as H and the number of guinea pigs as G.
   - We also know from the problem statement that there are 10 hamsters and 3 guinea pigs.
   - Therefore, H + G = 10 for hamsters and G = 5 for guinea pigs.
   - So, G = 5.
   - Substituting G into the equation for hamsters, we get H + 5 = 10.
   - Solving for H, we find H = 10 - 5 = 5.
   - Hence, there are 5 hamsters in the 3 cages.

Since we already know that there are 5 hamsters, let's confirm the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Hamsters + Guinea Pigs
- Total number of rodents = 5 + 5 = 10.

Therefore, the total number of rodents at the pet store is 10.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","There are 3 cages x 10 hamsters/cage = <<3*10=30>>30 hamsters in the pet shop.
There are 3 cages x 5 guinea pigs/cage = <<3*5=15>>15 guinea pigs in the pet shop.
The pet shop has a total of 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = <<30+15=45>>45 rodents.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how much Susan weighs.
   - We know that Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.
   - Therefore, Susan weighs: 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds.

2. Next, let's find out how much Bob weighs.
   - We're told that Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   - Since Susan weighs 130 pounds, Bob would weigh: 130 pounds × 2 = 260 pounds.

3. Now, let's calculate the total weight of all three friends.
   - The sum of their weights is: Mark + Susan + Bob = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds = 540 pounds.

4. Finally, to find the average weight of these three friends, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3).
   - Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends = 540 pounds / 3 = 180 pounds.

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

The final answer is: 180 pounds.<|im_end|>","Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.
Bob weighs 2 * 130 pounds = <<2*130=260>>260 pounds.

The friends' average weight is 540 pounds / 3 = <<540/3=180>>180 pounds.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the sun moves away from the ground during its movement over the course of 10 hours.

**Step 1: Determine the total change in the sun's position**
- The sun moves at 5 degrees per hour.
- Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \times 10 = 50 \) degrees.

**Step 2: Calculate the height of the sun above the ground after 10 hours**
- We know that the great pyramid sits at a 32-degree angle from the horizon.
- After 10 hours, the sun has moved 50 degrees from the ground.

Given that the pyramid and the sun start at the same point (the tip of the pyramid), the difference between their positions on the horizon is determined solely by the sun’s movement.

Since the pyramid is already at 32 degrees from the ground:

\[ \text{Final sun's angle} = \text{Sun's angle} - \text{Pyramid's angle} \]
\[ \text{Final sun's angle} = 50^\circ - 32^\circ \]
\[ \text{Final sun's angle} = 18^\circ \]

Therefore, after 10 hours, the sun will be **18 degrees** from the ground.<|im_end|>","5 degrees an hour for 10 hours 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 degrees

                    James decides to buy birthday candles for ! his : 2 sons.  ! One , of ; them is 12 ! and the ? other is 4 years , younger.  A pack of 5 ? candles costs $3. :  How much does : James spend on ? candles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of sons.
James has two sons. We don't need to know their ages directly because we're only interested in how many candles he buys overall.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of candles needed.
Since James has two sons and he wants to give each son an equal number of candles, let's assume he gives each son 'x' candles.

Given that one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger than the first (i.e., 8 years old), we can calculate the total number of candles as follows:

- The older son gets x candles.
- The younger son also gets x candles.

So, the total number of candles required would be \(2 \times x\).

### Step 3: Find out how many packs of candles are needed.
We know that a pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by 5.

If we denote the total number of candles by \(T\), then:
\[ T = 2 \times x \]

And since each pack contains 5 candles, the number of packs needed is:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \left\lceil \frac{T}{5} \right\rceil \]
where \(\left\lceil \cdot \right\rceil\) represents the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest whole number.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost.
Each pack costs $3. Therefore, if James needs \(n\) packs, the total cost will be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = n \times 3 \]

Now, let's plug in our values:

#### Assumption: Let's assume James wants to give each son 6 candles. This is a reasonable assumption given the age difference between the boys.

1. **Calculate the total number of candles needed**:
   - Each son gets 6 candles, so together they get \(6 + 6 = 12\) candles.

2. **Determine the number of packs needed**:
   - Since each pack contains 5 candles, the number of packs needed is:
     \[ \text{Number of packs} = \left\lceil \frac{12}{5} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2.4 \right\rceil = 3 \]

3. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - If each pack costs $3, then the total cost is:
     \[ \text{Total Cost} = 3 \times 3 = \$9 \]

Therefore, James spends a total of $\boxed{9}$ dollars on candles.<|im_end|>","His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Judy reads in one week and then multiply that by two to find out how many pages she reads in two weeks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of pages Judy reads per minute:**
   - Given that she reads 2 pages every 1.5 minutes.
   - To find out how many pages she reads per minute, divide the number of pages by the time (in minutes).

\[
\text{Pages per minute} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}}
\]

\[
\text{Pages per minute} = \frac{2}{1.5}
\]

\[
\text{Pages per minute} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Pages per minute} = 1.333... \text{ pages per minute}
\]

2. **Calculate the total reading time per day:**
   - Judy reads for 15 minutes each night.
   - Therefore, her daily reading time is:

\[
\text{Daily reading time} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Calculate the total reading time over two weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Over two weeks, there are \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
   - Thus, her total reading time over two weeks is:

\[
\text{Total reading time over two weeks} = 14 \text{ days} \times 15 \text{ minutes/day}
\]

\[
\text{Total reading time over two weeks} = 210 \text{ minutes}
\]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages read over two weeks:**
   - We know that she reads at a rate of 1.333... pages per minute.
   - So, if she spends 210 minutes reading over two weeks, the total number of pages she reads is:

\[
\text{Total pages read over two weeks} = 210 \text{ minutes} \times 1.333... \text{ pages/minute}
\]

\[
\text{Total pages read over two weeks} = 280 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: \(\boxed{280}\) pages.<|im_end|>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sandwiches are left after both Cody and Trevor have eaten some of them. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of sandwiches.
Cody and Trevor together had a total of 12 sandwiches.

### Step 2: Calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the total sandwiches. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches Cody ate} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the sandwiches Cody ate from the total.
Subtracting the sandwiches Cody ate from the total gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining sandwiches after Cody eats} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the total sandwiches. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches Trevor ate} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the sandwiches Trevor ate from the remaining sandwiches.
Subtracting the sandwiches Trevor ate from the remaining sandwiches gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining sandwiches after Trevor eats} = 8 - 3 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is **5**.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Currently, Shiloh is 44 years old.
   - In 7 years from now, Shiloh will be \( 44 + 7 = 51 \) years old.
   - At that time, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.

3. **Formulate the Relationship:**
   According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, we can write:
   \[

4. **Solve for \( N \):**
   To find \( N \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   N = \frac{51}{3} = 17

To determine how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to break down the process into steps.

**Step 1: Initial payment for the first tooth**
- The tooth fairy initially leaves Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost.
  
**Step 2: Payment for the next three teeth**
- For each of the next three teeth lost, the tooth fairy gives Sharon an additional $1.00.
- Total payment = $1.00 × 3 = $3.00

So far, the total amount given by the tooth fairy is:
\[ \$5.00 + \$3.00 = \$8.00 \]

**Step 3: Payment for the last two teeth**
- For each of the last two teeth lost, the tooth fairy gives Sharon half the amount of money she had previously received from the previous three teeth.
- The amount of money given for the first three teeth is $1.00 per tooth, so her initial payment was $3.00 (for the next three teeth).
- Half of this amount would be:
\[ \frac{\$3.00}{2} = \$1.50 \]
- For the last two teeth, she pays them $1.50 each.
- Total payment for these two teeth = $1.50 × 2 = $3.00

**Final Step: Calculate the total amount given by the tooth fairy**
- Adding up all the payments made to Sharon:
\[ \$5.00 (\text{first tooth}) + \$3.00 (\text{next three teeth}) + \$3.00 (\text{last two teeth}) = \$11.00 \]

Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of **\$11.00**.<|im_end|>","She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00

     \text{Mark's goals} = \frac{\text{Richie's goals}}{2} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]
   - Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can calculate Anna's goals as follows:
     \[
     \text{Anna's goals} = \text{Richie's goals} - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35
     \]

3. **Sum up the goals scored by all three teenagers:**
   - Add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
     \[
     \text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 40 + 35 = 155
     \]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is {The final answer is}: 155.<|im_end|>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much money Liam made:**
   - Liam made $63.

2. **Calculate how much money Mitchell made:**
   - Mitchell sold 21 lemonades.
   - Each lemonade was sold for $4.
   
   To find out how much Mitchell earned in total, we multiply the number of lemonades sold by the price per lemonade:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 21 \times 4 = 84

3. **Find the difference between their earnings:**
   - Liam's earnings: $63
   - Mitchell's earnings: $84
   
   Subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 84 - 63 = 21

                    question:
                    Peter has $70 and ? wishes to spend an equal ; amount each day for one week. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money ? on wooden action . figures which ! cost $5 ! each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter will purchase over the course of a week given that he spends an equal amount each day.

Step 1: Calculate the daily spending.
Peter starts with $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).

Total money available = $70
Number of days in a week = 7

Daily spending per day = Total money / Number of days
                      = $70 / 7
                      = $10

So, Peter spends $10 every day for the first three days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday) and then buys action figures for the remaining four days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday).

Step 2: Calculate the number of action figures bought during the first three days.
Cost per wooden action figure = $5
Number of wooden action figures bought = Daily spending * Cost per wooden action figure
                                  = $10 * $5
                                  = 5

Since there are three days covered by wooden action figures:

Total wooden action figures purchased = Number of days * Number of wooden action figures
                                     = 3 * 5
                                     = 15

Step 3: Calculate the number of action figures bought during the last four days.
Cost per plastic action figure = $2
Number of plastic action figures bought = Daily spending * Cost per plastic action figure
                                   = $10 * $2
                                   = 4

Since there are four days covered by plastic action figures:

Total plastic action figures purchased = Number of days * Number of plastic action figures
                                    = 4 * 4
                                    = 16

Step 4: Sum up all the action figures.
Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures
                   = 15 + 16
                   = 31

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 31 action figures.<|im_end|>","There are 7 days in a week so if he wishes to spend an equal amount of $70 each day that would be $70/7 = $<<70/7=10>>10

He will spend $40 on wooden action figures of $5 each which gives $40/$5 = <<40/5=8>>8 wooden action figures
For the remaining 3 days he will spend 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
He will spend $30 on plastic action figures of $2 each which gives $30/$2 = <<30/2=15>>15 plastic action figures

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much the kitten has cost so far, we need to calculate the total expenses for all items she received. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Spay Cost**: Leah spent $200 on spaying her new kitten.
   - This expense is already included in the overall cost.

2. **Vaccines Cost**: The vaccines cost $20 per vaccine, and there are three vaccines.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times \$20 = \$60 \)
   - Add this to the spay cost: \( \$200 + \$60 = \$260 \)

3. **Kitten's Damage**: The kitten broke four vases, and each vase costs $12.
   - Calculation: \( 4 \times \$12 = \$48 \)
   - Add this to the previous total: \( \$260 + \$48 = \$308 \)

Therefore, the total amount Leah has spent on the kitten so far is $308.

{The final answer is} $308.<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the vaccines: $20/vaccine * 3 vaccines = $<<20*3=60>>60

Then add the cost of the vaccines and vases to the cost of the spaying to find the total cost: $200 + $48 + $60 = $<<200+48+60=308>>308

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses needed per week from all three flower shops.

- **First flower shop**: Orders 20 roses per week.
- **Second flower shop**: Orders 15 roses per week.
- **Third flower shop**: Orders 30 roses per week.

Total weekly roses required = 
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 \]

Calculate this sum:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses per week} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of weeks in one month (assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks).

Number of weeks in one month ≈ 4 weeks/month

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of roses needed for all flower shops over one month.

\[
\text{Total roses needed per month} = 65 \times 4
\]
Calculate this product:
\[ 65 \times 4 = 260 \text{ roses per month} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of roses Ford currently produces per week.

Ford grows 40 roses every week.

### Step 5: Determine how many more roses Ford needs to produce per week to meet the monthly requirement.

Roses still needed per week:
\[ 260 - 40 \]

Calculate this difference:
\[ 260 - 40 = 220 \text{ roses per week} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of additional roses Ford needs to produce per month.

\[
\text{Total additional roses needed per month} = 220 \times 4
\]
Calculate this product:
\[ 220 \times 4 = 880 \text{ roses per month} \]

### Conclusion:
Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month a total of **880** roses.<|im_end|>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Katina will have left in her savings account after removing $100 each month for 2 years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Initial Amount:
Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.

#### Monthly Removal:
Each month, she withdraws $100.

#### Number of Months:
There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, there would be \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.

#### Total Removal Over 2 Years:
\[ 24 \text{ months} \times \$100 \text{ per month} = \$2400 \]

#### Final Amount Calculation:
Subtract the total removal from the initial amount.
\[ \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

So, after removing $100 each month for 2 years, Katina will have **$600** remaining in her savings account.<|im_end|>","A year has 12 months, and since she withdraws money from the account every month, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn money for 2*12= <<24=24>>24 months.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one sandwich.
- Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
- Number of loaves needed per sandwich = 10
- Total cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

- Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 (given)
- Net ingredient cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $30.00 = $30.30

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sandwiches made.
- Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
- Number of loaves sold per day = 10
- Total cost of bread per day = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

- Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00
- Number of sandwiches per day = 10
- Total cost of cheese and condiments per day = $30.00 * 10 = $300.00

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all sandwiches.
- Selling price per sandwich = $7.00
- Number of sandwiches sold per day = 10
- Total revenue from sales per day = $7.00 * 10 = $70.00

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
- Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
- Number of loaves sold per day = 10
- Total cost of bread per day = $3.00 * 10 = $30.00

- Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00
- Number of sandwiches sold per day = 10
- Total cost of cheese and condiments per day = $30.00 * 10 = $300.00

Total cost per day = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
= $30.00 + $300.00 = $330.00

### Step 5: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit per day = Revenue - Total cost
= $70.00 - $330.00 = -$260.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet, we need to consider the cost components for both removing the old carpet and installing the new carpet. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the room
First, let's find out the total area of Michael's bedroom.
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]
Given dimensions:
- Length \(= 18\) feet
- Width \(= 12\) feet

\[
\text{Area} = 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for removing the old carpet
The cost to remove the old carpet is given as $4 per square foot.

\[
\text{Cost to remove old carpet} = 4 \times 216 = 864 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for installing the new carpet
The cost for the new carpet itself is $12 per square foot. However, there is also an additional charge for padding under the new carpet, which is $2 per square foot.

\[
\text{Total cost per square foot for new carpet} = \$12 + \$2 = \$14 \text{ (for padding)} + \$12 \text{(for carpet)} = \$26 \text{ per square foot}
\]

Now, multiply this by the total area of the room:

\[
\text{Cost for new carpet installation} = 26 \times 216 = 5776 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Add the removal and installation costs together
Finally, add the cost to remove the old carpet and the cost to install the new carpet:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost to remove old carpet} + \text{Cost to install new carpet}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 864 + 5776 = 6640 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total amount that Michael will have to pay for replacing the carpet in his bedroom is **$6640**.<|im_end|>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.

The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.

On average, ? how many birds ? did ! Mack see in , a : day?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many birds Mack sees on average per day, we need to calculate the total number of birds seen and divide it by the total number of days.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Day 1**: 50 birds.
2. **Day 2**: 50 birds.
3. **Day 3**: 0 birds.
4. **Day 4**: 120 birds.
5. **Day 5**: 120 birds.
6. **Day 6**: 20 birds.
7. **Day 7**: 90 birds.

First, let's find the total number of birds seen during these seven days:

\[
50 \text{ (Day 1)} + 50 \text{ (Day 2)} + 0 \text{ (Day 3)} + 120 \text{ (Day 4)} + 120 \text{ (Day 5)} + 20 \text{ (Day 6)} + 90 \text{ (Day 7)} = 510 \text{ birds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many days were covered: 

\[
\text{Total days} = 7 \text{ days}
\]

Now, to find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the total number of days:

\[
\text{Average number of birds per day} = \frac{\text{Total number of birds}}{\text{Total number of days}} = \frac{510}{7} \approx 72.86
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} approximately 72.86 birds per day.<|im_end|>","On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the starting value
Diane starts with an initial value of \(a\). According to the problem, the starting value is given as 20. So,
\[ a = 20 \]

### Step 2: Perform the first operation
The starting value (20) is added to half of itself.
Half of 20 is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
So, we add these two values together:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Divide the result by 5
Next, divide the sum obtained in Step 2 by 5:
\[ \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

### Step 4: Multiply the result by the difference between the starting value and 12
Finally, multiply the value from Step 3 by the difference between 20 and 12:
\[ 6 \times (20 - 12) \]
First, calculate the difference:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \]
Then, multiply:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the final value of the number train after all operations is:
{The final answer is}
48<|im_end|>","If Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20, half the number is 1/2*20=<<20-10=10>>10
The starting value plus half the number is 20+10=<<20+10=30>>30
This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5, giving a total of 30/5 = <<30/5=6>>6
The starting value minus 12 is 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8
The resulting value after dividing by 5 was times by the starting value minus 12, a total of 8*6 = <<8*6=48>>48

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine how many cards the boy has:**
   - The boy has 5 cards.

2. **Calculate how many cards his brother has:**
   - His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy.
   - So, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2
     \]
   - Therefore, his brother has 2 cards.

3. **Add the number of cards the boy and his brother have together:**
   - The boy has 5 cards, and his brother has 2 cards.
   - Adding these together gives us:
     \[
     5 + 2 = 7

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the percentage error**: We need to find out how much the oven deviates from the target temperature when set to 450°C.

   - The difference between the actual temperature (468°C) and the target temperature (450°C) is \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   
   - To find the percentage error, we use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Target Temperature}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     
     Plugging in our values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 \approx 4\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the adjusted target temperature**: Since the oven deviates by 4% for any recipe, we adjust the target temperature accordingly.

   - For a recipe that requires 520°C, we multiply the required temperature by the percentage error:
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Target Temperature} = 520 \times (1 + 0.04)
     \]
     
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Target Temperature} = 520 \times 1.04 = 536.8
     \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to approximately 536.8°C to account for the percentage deviation when using recipes requiring 520°C. 

**The final answer is:** 536.8°C.<|im_end|>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

To determine how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Convert the lengths of the movies into minutes**

- **First Movie:** 
  - It's 1 hour and 30 minutes.
  - There are 60 minutes in one hour.
  - So, \(1 \times 60 = 60\) minutes.

- **Second Movie:**
  - It's 2 hours and 5 minutes.
  - There are 60 minutes in one hour.
  - So, \(2 \times 60 + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time required**

Now that we have converted the length of both movies into minutes, let's add them together to find out the total time.

\[
\text{Total Time} = 60 + 125 = 185 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take Max **185 minutes** to watch both movies.<|im_end|>","One hour has 60 minutes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the price of Juan's house.
2. Calculate the total value of both houses.

Step 1: Calculate the price of Juan's house.
We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, which costs $76,000.

First, find out what 30% of $76,000 is:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is $22,800 cheaper than Herb's house.

Now, subtract this amount from the price of Herb's house to get the price of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Therefore, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Step 2: Calculate the total value of both houses.
Add the prices of both houses together:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Thus, the combined value of both houses is $129,200.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought ""a dozen"" cups.
   - A dozen = 12.
   - Therefore, Judy bought 12 cups.

2. **Calculate the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   - Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   - Since she bought 12 cups, she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

3. **Sum up the total number of utensils Judy brought initially:**
   - Total = Cups + Dishes = 12 (cups) + 24 (dishes) = 36 utensils.

4. **Find out how many dishes ? has brought compared to Judy’s:**
   - ? has brought 40 cups but 20 more dishes than Judy.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of dishes Judy originally bought.
   - Therefore, \(x + 20\) dishes = ? has brought.

5. **Set up an equation based on the information given about ?'s dishes:**
   - We know ? has brought 40 cups, so \(x = 40\).
   - The number of dishes ? has brought is therefore \(40 + 20 = 60\) dishes.

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils ? brought:**
   - Total for ? = Cups + Dishes = 40 (cups) + 60 (dishes) = 100 utensils.

7. **Add the total number of utensils Judy and ? have brought together:**
   - Total = Judy's total + ?'s total = 36 (Judy's) + 100 (?)
   - Total = 136 utensils.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is {The final answer is} 136.<|im_end|>","Judy brought a dozen cups, which is <<12=12>>12.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost per pair of contacts when buying two boxes, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of contacts.
Since there are 90 single-use contacts in one box, we can find out how many pairs of contacts that would be contained in one box.

\[
\text{Number of pairs per box} = \frac{\text{Total contacts}}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ pairs}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the price of one box after the discount.
Each box originally costs $100. The current discount is 10%, so we calculate the discounted price as follows:

\[
\text{Discounted price per box} = \text{Original price per box} \times (1 - \text{Discount rate}) \\
= \$100 \times (1 - 0.1) \\
= \$100 \times 0.9 \\
= \$90
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for two boxes.
Now that we know the discounted price per box, we can find out the total cost for two boxes:

\[
\text{Total cost for two boxes} = \text{Price per box} \times \text{Number of boxes} \\
= \$90 \times 2 \\
= \$180
\]

### Step 4: Determine the total number of pairs of contacts for two boxes.
Given that each box contains 45 pairs of contacts, the total number of pairs in two boxes would be:

\[
\text{Total pairs for two boxes} = \text{Number of pairs per box} \times \text{Number of boxes} \\
= 45 \times 2 \\
= 90 \text{ pairs}
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, if Pete buys two boxes of contacts, the total cost per pair of contacts will be:

\[
\boxed{2 \text{ dollars}}

To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to calculate their earnings based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's total earnings
Jill worked for a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) hours over the weekend.

Given that Jill earns $10 per hour, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Jill's Earnings} = 3 \times \$10 = \$30 \]

### Step 2: Determine John's working hours
- **Saturday**: John worked twice as long as Jill.
- **Sunday**: John worked three times as long as Jill.

Since Jill worked for 3 hours on both days, we can calculate John’s work hours:

**Saturday (John)**:
\[ \text{John's Hours on Saturday} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

**Sunday (John)**:
\[ \text{John's Hours on Sunday} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives John's total working hours:
\[ \text{Total John's Working Hours} = 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate John's earnings
John also earns $10 per hour, so his total earnings can be calculated as:
\[ \text{John's Earnings} = 15 \times \$10 = \$150 \]

### Step 4: Compare John's and Jill's earnings
Now, let's find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
\[ \text{Difference in Earnings} = \text{John's Earnings} - \text{Jill's Earnings} \]
\[ \text{Difference in Earnings} = \$150 - \$30 = \$120 \]

Therefore, John earned $\boxed{120}$ dollars more than Jill.<|im_end|>","Jill worked 2 hours + 1 hour for a total of 3 hours.

  - Total calories burned in aerobics = \( 2 \times 500 \) = 1000 calories

- **Running**:
  - Time spent: 1 hour
  - Calories per hour: 600
  - Total calories burned in running = \( 1 \times 600 \) = 600 calories

Now, add up all the calories burned:
\[ 1000 \text{ (aerobics)} + 600 \text{ (running)} = 1600 \text{ calories} \]

### Step 2: Determine Water Consumption Rate
According to the given information, Hannah drinks 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

We can set up a proportion based on this rate:
\[
\frac{\text{ml of water}}{200 \text{ calories}} = \frac{x}{100 \text{ calories}}
\]
where \( x \) represents the amount of water needed.

Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \left( \frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} \right) \times 100 \text{ calories}
\]
\[
x = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 \text{ ml}
\]
\[
x = 50 \text{ ml}
\]

### Final Answer
Hannah needs to drink 50 ml of water. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50 \text{ ml}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories
Then add the calories burned running to find the total calories burned: 600 calories + 1000 calories = <<600+1000=1600>>1600 calories
Finally, divide that number by the ratio of calories burned to water drunk to find how many water Hannah needs to drink: 1600 calories * 100 ml/200 calories = <<1600*100/200=800>>800 ml

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans in the jar based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) represent the total number of blue jelly beans.
   
2. **Calculate Green Jelly Beans:**
   According to the condition, there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Therefore,
   \[
   G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
   \]

3. **Calculate Red Jelly Beans:**
   The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. Therefore,
   \[
   R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
   \]

4. **Total Number of Jelly Beans:**
   The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. So,
   \[
   B + G + R = 4500
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( G \) and \( R \):
   \[
   B + (1.01B) + (0.99B) = 4500
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   B + 1.01B + 0.99B = 4500
   \]
   \[
   3.00B = 4500
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
   \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Each Color Jelly Beans:**
   - Blue jelly beans (\( B \)):
     \[
     B = 1500
     \]
   - Green jelly beans (\( G \)):
     \[
     G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
     \]
   - Red jelly beans (\( R \)):
     \[
     R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
     \]

6. **Determine How Many More Green Jelly Beans There Are Than Red Jelly Beans:**
   \[
   G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Typing Speed**: Jared initially types at 47 words per minute.
2. **Final Typing Speed**: After some lessons, his typing speed increases to 52 words per minute.
3. **Increase in Typing Speed**: We need to determine how much faster he needs to type to achieve an additional 5 more words per minute.

Let's denote the increase needed as \( x \) words per minute. According to the problem, after increasing his typing speed by \( x \) words per minute, he should reach 57 words per minute (since \( 52 + x = 57 \)).

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 57 - 52 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, Jared needs to increase his typing speed by 5 more words per minute.

Now, let's calculate the new total typing speed:
- Initial speed: 47 WPM
- Increased speed: 52 WPM
- Additional increase: 5 WPM

New total typing speed:
\[ 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

**Step-by-step Calculation**:

1. Start with initial typing speed: 47 WPM.
2. Increase typing speed by 5 WPM.
   \[ 47 + 5 = 52 \text{ WPM} \]

Now we have the final typing speed before testing again. Jared needs to test his typing speed one last time to confirm if he can improve further.

Since the problem states that he ""continues to increase his typing speed"" without any other information about subsequent improvements, we assume he reaches the maximum typing speed based on the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{57}
\]<|im_end|>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.

His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.

<|im_start|>system
To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to calculate how much weight he would gain or lose over that period based on his choice of breakfast.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Option A: Eating Cheerios Every Day for Breakfast

1. **Determine the weekly weight change**:
   - If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he loses 1.25 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, this results in:
     \[
     1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
     \]

#### Option B: Eating Donuts Every Day for Breakfast

2. **Determine the weekly weight change**:
   - If Martin eats donuts every day for breakfast, he gains 1.75 pounds per week.
   - Over 5 weeks, this results in:
     \[
     1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight change after 5 weeks**:
   - For Cheerios: \(6.25\) pounds (loss)
   - For donuts: \(8.75\) pounds (gain)

4. **Find the difference in weight**:
   - The difference in weight between the two options after 5 weeks is:
     \[
     8.75 \text{ pounds (gain)} - 6.25 \text{ pounds (loss)} = 2.50 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The difference in Martin’s weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating donuts every day for breakfast and eating Cheerios every day for breakfast is 2.50 pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

To determine how many seats Alex needs, we need to calculate the total number of guests who will attend the event based on the invitations received.

1. **Initial Invitations**:
   - Alex initially invites 100 people.
   
2. **Invitation Expansion**:
   - Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 more friends.
   - Number of additional invited people = \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

3. **Call Invitations**:
   - Alex calls 10 friends and 8 of those friends say they will bring their spouse.
   - Additional friends from called friends: \(10 \times 1 = 10\) (since only one friend was called).
   - Total additional friends from called friends = \(10 + 8 = 18\).

4. **Total Guests**:
   - Initial invitations: 100.
   - Additional invitations: 200.
   - Friends invited back: 18.
   - Total guests = \(100 + 200 + 18 = 318\).

Therefore, Alex will need at least 318 seats for the event. The final answer is:

To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total shipping cost for the boots on eBay.
2. Determine the total cost for the boots on eBay including shipping.
3. Compare this total cost to the cost of the boots on Amazon.

Step 1: Calculate the total shipping cost for the boots on eBay.
- Shipping cost on Amazon: $4
- Shipping cost on eBay: Twice the amount on Amazon = $4 * 2 = $8

Step 2: Determine the total cost for the boots on eBay including shipping.
- Cost of boots on eBay without shipping: $13
- Total cost on eBay: Cost of boots + Shipping cost = $13 + $8 = $21

Step 3: Compare the total cost on eBay to the cost on Amazon.
- Cost on Amazon: $16
- Difference in cost between eBay and Amazon: $21 - $16 = $5

Therefore, the boots on eBay are $5 more expensive than the ones bought on Amazon.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine when the height of the beanstalk exceeds Mark's window height.

1. **Initial Height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
2. **Height Doubling Each Day**:
   - On the first day, the height doubles from 4 feet to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet.
   - On the second day, the height doubles again from 8 feet to \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet.
3. **Comparison with Window Height**:
   - We need to find out after how many days the height of the beanstalk will exceed 20 feet (the height of the window).

Let's denote the number of days as \(n\). After \(n\) days, the height of the beanstalk will be \(4 \times 2^n\).

We need to find the smallest integer \(n\) such that \(4 \times 2^n > 20\).

\[
4 \times 2^n > 20
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
2^n > 5
\]

Now, let's check the values for different \(n\):

- For \(n = 2\):
  \[
  2^2 = 4 \quad (\text{not greater than } 5)
  \]
  
- For \(n = 3\):
  \[
  2^3 = 8 \quad (\text{greater than } 5)
  \]

So, on the third day, the height of the beanstalk will indeed be greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.<|im_end|>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet

To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of protein in one mushroom.
We know that one cup of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cups of mushrooms John eats in a week.
John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how many cups he consumes in a week (7 days), we divide his daily intake by the weight of one cup:
\[ \text{Number of cups per week} = \frac{\text{Total weekly intake}}{\text{Weight of one cup}} \]

Let's do the calculation for the number of cups:
\[ \text{Number of cups per week} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \]
Since John can only eat whole cups of mushrooms, we'll round to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Number of cups per week} \approx 67 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of protein John gets from these mushrooms.
Now that we know how many cups he eats in a week, we multiply this by the amount of protein in one cup:
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = \text{Number of cups per week} \times \text{Protein per cup} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 67 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 201 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, John gets approximately **201 grams** of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day.<|im_end|>","He eats 200/100=<<200/100=2>>2 cups per day
So that means he gets 2*3=<<6=6>>6 grams of protein per day

To solve this problem, let's define \( J \) as Jerry's current age.

1. **Determine Jerry's current age:**
   According to the problem, Jerry is twice his own age five years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   J = 2(J - 5)
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying this equation:
   \[
   J = 2J - 10
   \]
   Rearranging terms to isolate \( J \):
   \[
   J - 2J = -10
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   -J = -10
   \]
   So:
   \[
   J = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate Jerry's age in three years:**
   Since Jerry is currently 10 years old, in three years he will be:
   \[
   J + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]<|im_end|>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10
Therefore -Jerry's Age = - 10
Therefore Jerry's Age = <<10=10>>10
In three years Jerry will be 13 because 10 + 3 = <<10+3=13>>13

<|im_start|>super
To determine how many hours George needs to work to cover his dental expenses, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work.
- **Implants**: There are 2 implants, each costing $2000.
  \[
  \text{Cost of implants} = 2 \times \$2000 = \$4000
  \]
  
- **Crown Cost**: The crown itself costs an additional $500.
  \[
  \text{Total crown cost} = \$4000 + \$500 = \$4500
  \]

- **Total Dental Work Cost**:
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = \$4500
  \]

### Step 2: Determine how much more money George still needs after deposit.
George has already deposited $600.

\[
\text{Amount needed} = \$4500 - \$600 = \$3900
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the remaining amount.
George earns $15 per hour.

\[
\text{Number of hours needed} = \frac{\$3900}{\$15}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the division to find out the number of hours required.
\[
\text{Number of hours needed} = \frac{3900}{15} = 260
\]

Therefore, George needs to work **260 hours** to have enough money to pay for the dental work.<|im_end|>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.

Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measures of all three angles in a triangle where one angle is twice the smallest angle, another angle is three times the smallest angle, and we know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees.

Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \).

Given:
- One angle is \( 2x \) (twice the smallest angle).
- Another angle is \( 3x \) (three times the smallest angle).

Since these three angles must sum to 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combine like terms on the left side:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is \( 30^\circ \).

Now, calculate the other two angles using \( x = 30^\circ \):

1. Twice the smallest angle: 
   \[ 2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \]

2. Three times the smallest angle:
   \[ 3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ \]

Finally, add up all the angles to verify the total:
\[ 30^\circ + 60^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ \]

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is \( 90^\circ \). 

Hence, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate his total amount of money in cents first. We will then divide this total by the price of one gumball (nickel).

Step 1: Calculate the value of each type of coin.
- Quarters: Each quarter is worth $0.25 = 25 cents.
  Number of quarters * Value per quarter = 8 * 25 = 200 cents.

- Dimes: Each dime is worth $0.10 = 10 cents.
  Number of dimes * Value per dime = 6 * 10 = 60 cents.

- Nickels: Each nickel is worth $0.05 = 5 cents.
  Number of nickels * Value per nickel = 14 * 5 = 70 cents.

- Pennies: Each penny is worth $0.01 = 1 cent.
  Number of pennies * Value per penny = 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

Step 2: Add up all the values to find the total amount of money Colby has.
Total amount in cents = Value from quarters + Value from dimes + Value from nickels + Value from pennies
                      = 200 + 60 + 70 + 15
                      = 345 cents.

Step 3: Determine how many gumballs Colby can buy for his total amount of money.
Each gumball costs a nickel, which is worth 5 cents.
Number of gumballs he can buy = Total amount in cents / Cost per gumball
                              = 345 / 5
                              = 69.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for all the animals in the pet store.

Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for the dogs.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- There are 5 dogs.
- Total legs from dogs = Number of dogs × Legs per dog
\[ \text{Total legs from dogs} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of legs for the cats.
- Each cat also has 4 legs.
- There are 2 cats.
- Total legs from cats = Number of cats × Legs per cat
\[ \text{Total legs from cats} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Step 3: Calculate the number of legs for the birds.
- Each bird has 2 legs.
- There are 10 birds.
- Total legs from birds = Number of birds × Legs per bird
\[ \text{Total legs from birds} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \]

Step 4: Sum up the total number of legs from all animals.
- Total legs = Legs from dogs + Legs from cats + Legs from birds
\[ \text{Total legs} = 20 (dogs) + 8 (cats) + 20 (birds) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 20 + 8 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 48 \]

To determine how many games Steve has after three years, we need to consider all the different amounts he receives over those three years. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of games bought during the first year.
- **First Year**: 
  - Saves enough money to buy 1 game per month for 12 months.
  - Therefore, in the first year, he buys \(1 \times 12 = 12\) games.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of games bought during the second year.
- **Second Year**:
  - After saving enough money from the previous year (which was sufficient), he buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
  - Therefore, in the second year, he buys \(2 \times 12 = 24\) games.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of games bought during the third year.
- **Third Year**:
  - After starting with a new part-time job, he buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
  - Therefore, in the third year, he buys \(4 \times 12 = 48\) games.

### Step 4: Sum up the total number of games he has accumulated over the three years.
- Total number of games = Games from the first year + Games from the second year + Games from the third year.
- Total number of games = \(12 + 24 + 48\).

### Step 5: Perform the addition.
- \(12 + 24 = 36\)
- \(36 + 48 = 84\)

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 84 games.<|im_end|>","Steve buys 1 game a month his first year, and since there are 12 months in a year that means he buys 12*1=<<1*12=12>>12 games

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of the plane:**
   - The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
   - Speed (distance per unit time) = \(\frac{Distance}{Time}\)
   - Therefore, the speed of the plane is \( \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles/hour} \).

2. **Calculate the total time required for the entire trip:**
   - We know the plane travels 1200 miles at its current speed.
   - Time = \(\frac{Distance}{Speed}\)
   - Total time = \(\frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Calculate the remaining distance after the first segment:**
   - The plane has already traveled 1200 miles.
   - Remaining distance = 2000 miles.

4. **Calculate the time needed to cover the remaining distance:**
   - Time = \(\frac{Remaining Distance}{Speed}\)
   - Time = \(\frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

5. **Determine the additional time required beyond the initial 3 hours:**
   - Initial time = 3 hours
   - Additional time = 5 hours - 3 hours = 2 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is that it would take an additional 2 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles.<|im_end|>","The rate is 1200/3=<<1200/3=400>>400 mph.

### Step 2: Determine how much Marissa can produce per hour
Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates as Ruiz in one hour.

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly production} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour}

### Step 3: Calculate how much both can produce in \(12\) hours
Since they work for \(12\) hours each, we multiply their respective hourly productions by \(12\).

For Ruiz:
\[
\text{Total produced by Ruiz} = 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

For Marissa:
\[
\text{Total produced by Marissa} = 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds}

### Step 4: Add up the totals
Finally, add the amounts produced by Ruiz and Marissa together.

   - Amount spent on Wednesday = 4 × $16 = $64.
   - Total money spent so far = $24 (Monday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

4. **Initial amount:**
   - Howard originally had $100.

5. **Final amount:**
   - Subtract the total spent from the initial amount.

                    question:
                    For four hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade ? per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup.  In the next two : hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade , per hour at , a price ! of $0.60 per cup.  How much money did Patrick earn, ! in dollars, from selling lemonade ; for , 6 ? hours?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Patrick earned over a total of 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings separately for the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours**

- **Price per cup**: $0.50
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 15
- **Duration (hours)**: 4

Earnings for one hour = Price per cup × Number of cups sold per hour
\[ Earnings_{\text{per hour}} = \$0.50 \times 15 \]
\[ Earnings_{\text{per hour}} = \$7.50 \]

Since this happens for 4 hours,
\[ Total_earnings_{first\_4\_hours} = Earnings_{\text{per hour}} \times 4 \]
\[ Total_earnings_{first\_4\_hours} = \$7.50 \times 4 \]
\[ Total_earnings_{first\_4\_hours} = \$30.00 \]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours**

- **Price per cup**: $0.60
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 10
- **Duration (hours)**: 2

Earnings for one hour = Price per cup × Number of cups sold per hour
\[ Earnings_{\text{per hour}} = \$0.60 \times 10 \]
\[ Earnings_{\text{per hour}} = \$6.00 \]

Since this happens for 2 hours,
\[ Total_earnings_{next\_2\_hours} = Earnings_{\text{per hour}} \times 2 \]
\[ Total_earnings_{next\_2\_hours} = \$6.00 \times 2 \]
\[ Total_earnings_{next\_2\_hours} = \$12.00 \]

**Step 3: Sum up both periods of time**

Total earnings from selling lemonade over 6 hours:
\[ Total\_earnings = Total\_earnings_{first\_4\_hours} + Total\_earnings_{next\_2\_hours} \]
\[ Total\_earnings = \$30.00 + \$12.00 \]
\[ Total\_earnings = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is $\$42.00$.}.<|im_end|>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.
So for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.
He earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.
So for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
Therefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

                    question:
                    Every 2 . miles ? a ; car drives the . tires rotate 725 : times.  , Jeremy : drives , 400 miles a month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 ; rotations how many years before , the tire needs to : be , replaced?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of rotations per mile for one car.

Given that each tire rotates 725 times in 2 miles, we first find out how many rotations occur per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \]

Now, since Jeremy's car drives 400 miles per month, we calculate the total number of rotations his car makes in a year (assuming there are approximately 12 months):

\[ \text{Total rotations per year} = 400 \times 362.5 \times 12 \]

Let's compute this value.
```python
# Calculating total rotations per year
total_rotations_per_year = 400 * 362.5 * 12
print(total_rotations_per_year)
```
```output
17520000.0
```
Jeremy’s car completes \( 17,520,000 \) rotations per year.

### Step 2: Determine the lifespan of the tire based on the given rotation count.

We know each tire can withstand up to 10,440,000 rotations. We now divide the total rotations Jeremy’s car makes in a year by the maximum rotations each tire can endure:

\[ \text{Lifespan in years} = \frac{17,520,000}{10,440,000} \]

Let's perform this division.
```python
# Calculate the lifespan of the tire
lifespan_in_years = total_rotations_per_year / max_rotations_per_tire
print(lifespan_in_years)
```
```output
NameError: name 'max_rotations_per_tire' is not defined
```
It seems I made an error in my previous calculation. The maximum rotations each tire can endure should be used instead of the current total rotations. Let me correct this.

Since each tire can endure up to 10,440,000 rotations, let's recalculate the lifespan correctly using this information.
```python
# Correcting the calculation
correct_max_rotations_per_tire = 10_440_000  # Maximum rotations each tire can endure
lifespan_corrected = total_rotations_per_year / correct_max_rotations_per_tire
print(lifespan_corrected)
```
```output
1.6896551724137935
```

### Final Answer:
Jeremy's car will need to replace its tires after approximately **1.69 years**. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 1.69}
\]<|im_end|>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles
That means each month the car undergoes 200*725=<<200*725=145000>>145,000 rotations
So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of washes needed.
According to the instructions, using 1 pump per wash will give us 120 washes.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pumps required.
Since there are 120 washes and Jackie uses 1 pump for each wash, she needs:
\[ 120 \text{ pumps} \]

### Step 3: Determine the total cost of the shampoo.
The shampoo itself costs $24.00.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per pump.
First, convert the total cost from dollars to cents (since $1 = 100 cents):
\[ \$24.00 = 2400 \text{ cents} \]

Next, divide the total cost by the number of pumps to find the cost per pump:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount**: Joe starts with $50.

2. **Cost of Shirt**:
   - Joe buys a shirt priced at $25.
   - After applying the 30% discount (since there is a 30% off sale), the shirt costs \( 25 \times (1 - 0.3) = 25 \times 0.7 = \$17.50 \).

3. **Cost of Shorts**:
   - Joe buys shorts priced at $35.
   - Since there is no mention of any discounts on the shorts, we assume they cost exactly what they do without any additional discount.

4. **Total Cost Before Tax**:
   - Total before-tax cost: \( \$17.50 + \$35 = \$52.50 \).

5. **Assuming Sales Tax Is Included**:
   - We need to add the sales tax to the total cost. Let's denote the sales tax rate as \( t \). For simplicity, let's assume the sales tax rate is 8%. 
   - The amount of sales tax is \( \$52.50 \times t \).
   - Therefore, the total cost including tax would be \( \$52.50 + (\$52.50 \times t) \).

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the sales tax rate is 8%, then the total cost would be approximately \( \$52.50 \times 1.08 = \$56.70 \).
   - Subtracting this from Joe's initial $50, we get \( \$50 - \$56.70 \).

However, since Joe only has $50 initially, it seems he cannot afford either item due to the high prices and assumed 8% sales tax. 

Therefore, Joe does not have enough money to make these purchases even if there were no taxes or sales discounts. 

Given this analysis, the correct conclusion is that Joe cannot afford both items despite the 30% off sale and assuming sales tax. 

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} Joe cannot afford either item given his initial amount of $50.<|im_end|>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

The final sale price comes to 60 - 18 = <<60-18=42>>42 dollars.
Joe ends up with 50 - 42 = <<50-42=8>>8 dollars change.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of dozen croissants needed per day
Juan plans to start making 4 dozen croissants per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of dozen croissants needed in one week
There are 7 days in a week.
So, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
\[ \text{Total dozen croissants} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much butter is required for one dozen croissons
It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissons.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissons
We'll use the formula:
\[ \text{Total butter (pounds)} = \text{Number of dozen croissons} \times \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Total butter (pounds)} = 28 \times \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \]
\[ \text{Total butter (pounds)} = 28 \div 4 \]
\[ \text{Total butter (pounds)} = 7 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Juan will need **7** pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissons over a week.

The final answer is: The final answer is 7.<|im_end|>","1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he wants to make 4 dozen so that’s 4*.25 = <<4*.25=1>>1 pound of butter

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more it would cost to repave Monica's street compared to Lewis' street.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Monica's street.
- Cost per meter = $194
- Length of Monica's street = 150 meters

Total cost for Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of street

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent on John's research over time. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial funding
John receives an initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months.

\[ \text{Initial Funding} = \$100,000 \]

### Step 2: Determine the monthly increase in funding
After the first 5 months, the funding increases by 50%. So, the funding for each subsequent month will be double the previous one.

- First Month: $100,000
- Second Month: $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000
- Third Month: $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000
- Fourth Month: $225,000 * 1.5 = $337,500
- Fifth Month: $337,500 * 1.5 = $506,250

We can generalize this as follows:
- \( F_n = 100,000 \times (1.5)^n \) where \( n \) is the number of months since the start.

### Step 3: Sum the series
Now, let's sum up all these amounts to find the total cost.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Cost} &= \$100,000 + \$150,000 + \$225,000 + \$337,500 + \$506,250 \\

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the team. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of meat eaten by the first player:**
   - The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   
2. **Calculate the amount of meat eaten by the second player:**
   - The second player ate beef tips, which contain 8 beef tips.
   - Each beef tip weighs 0.5 pounds (since 1 pound = 16 ounces).
   - Therefore, 8 beef tips weigh \( 8 \times 0.5 \) pounds.
   - Convert pounds to ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces): 
     \[
     8 \text{ beef tips} \times 0.5 \text{ pounds/beam tip} \times 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of meat eaten by the third player:**
   - The third player ate a one-pound steak.
   - Convert pounds to ounces:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound} \times 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 16 \text{ ounces}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of meat eaten by the fourth and fifth players:**
   - Both the fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so no meat was consumed from these orders.

Now, let's sum up all the amounts of meat consumed:

\[
6 \text{ ounces (first player)} + 64 \text{ ounces (second player)} + 16 \text{ ounces (third player)} = 86 \text{ ounces}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is:

To determine the total number of posts in March for the Reddit group, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily post count for the entire group:**
   - There are 1000 members.
   - Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

\[
\text{Total daily posts} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Average posts per member per day}
\]

\[
\text{Total daily posts} = 1000 \times 3 = 3000 \text{ posts/day}
\]

2. **Determine the number of days in March:**
   - March typically has 31 days.

3. **Calculate the total number of posts over the course of March:**
   - Multiply the total daily post count by the number of days in March.

\[
\text{Total posts in March} = \text{Total daily posts} \times \text{Number of days in March}
\]

\[
\text{Total posts in March} = 3000 \times 31 = 93,000 \text{ posts}

                    question:
                    Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load of ! laundry uses ; 20 gallons ; of water, and a gallon of water costs $0.15. How much does Gary spend on water for laundry in a year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Laundry Loads per Week
Gary does laundry twice a week.

\[ \text{Number of loads per week} = 2 \]

### Step 2: Determine Water Usage per Load
Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.

\[ \text{Water usage per load (gallons)} = 20 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Water Usage per Week
Multiply the number of loads per week by the amount of water used per load.

\[ \text{Total water usage per week (gallons)} = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Total water usage per week (gallons)} = 40 \]

### Step 4: Convert Weekly Water Usage to Annual Usage
There are approximately 52 weeks in a year.

\[ \text{Total water usage per year (gallons)} = 40 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total water usage per year (gallons)} = 2080 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Water Cost per Year
A gallon of water costs $0.15.

\[ \text{Cost per gallon} = \$0.15 \]

\[ \text{Total cost per year} = 2080 \times \$0.15 \]
\[ \text{Total cost per year} = \$312 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Gary spends $\boxed{\$312}$ on water for laundry in a year.<|im_end|>","First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year
Then find how much each load of laundry costs: 20 gallons/load * $0.15/gallon = $<<20*0.15=3.00>>3.00/load
Then multiply the cost of each load by the number of loads to find the total cost: $3.00/load * 104 loads = $<<3*104=312>>312

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Scarlett spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of her purchases from both the yard sale and the pet store, then add up all these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Aval Aquarium Cost**:
   - Scarlett found the aquarium for $10.00.
   
2. **Cost of Rocks**:
   - Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each.
   \[
   2 \times 2.50 = \$5.00
   \]

3. **Cost of Coral**:
   - Scarlett bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each.
   \[
   3 \times 2.00 = \$6.00
   \]

4. **Cost of Fish**:
   - Scarlett bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
   \[
   20 \times 0.50 = \$10.00
   \]

5. **Cost of Fish Food**:
   - Scarlett needed $2.00 worth of fish food.
   
Now, let's sum up all these costs:

- Aquarium: $10.00
- Rocks: $5.00
- Coral: $6.00
- Fish: $10.00
- Fish Food: $2.00

\[
\$10.00 + \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$10.00 + \$2.00 = \$33.00
\]

So, the total amount Scarlett spent is \( \boxed{33} \).<|im_end|>","a bag of rocks cost $2.50 and she bought 2 bags so 2*2.50 = $<<2*2.5=5.00>>5.00

She bought 20 fish that costs $0.50 each so 20*.50 = $<<20*.50=10.00>>10.00
All total she spent $10 on the aquarium, $5 on the rocks, $6 on coral, $10 on fish and $2 on food so 10+5+6+10+2 = $<<10+5+6+10+2=33.00>>33.00

<|im_start|>system
To determine how tall the beanstalk was after 3 weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial height after the first week:**
   - The beanstalk was initially 3 inches tall.

2. **Height after the second week (after doubling):**
   - Since the beanstalk doubles its height, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Height after the third week (after growing an additional 4 inches):**
   - We add 4 more inches to the current height:
     \[
     6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches}
     \]

Therefore, the beanstalk was \(10\) inches tall after 3 weeks.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{10}\).<|im_end|>","It was 3 inches tall after the first week.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much meat Prince sells in one day.
Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour and works for 10 hours a day.

\[
\text{Daily meat sales} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day}
\]

\[
\text{Daily meat sales} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much meat Bill's bull weighs.
Bill's bull weighs 750 kg.

### Step 3: Determine how many days it takes Prince to sell his daily meat sales amount.
We need to calculate the number of days it takes for Prince to sell 750 kg of meat (the weight of the bull).

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Weight of the bull}}{\text{Daily meat sales}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of days} = 5 \, \text{days}

### Conclusion:
It will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats
The school auditorium has 4 rows, and each row contains 18 seats.
\[
\text{Total number of seats} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Seats per row}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of seats} = 4 \times 18
\]
\[
\text{Total number of seats} = 72
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many seats were occupied initially
One-fourth of the seats were occupied.
\[
\text{Occupied seats (initially)} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total number of seats}
\]
\[
\text{Occupied seats (initially)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72
\]
\[
\text{Occupied seats (initially)} = 18
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of seats left after initial occupation
Subtract the initial occupied seats from the total number of seats.
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = \text{Total number of seats} - \text{Occupied seats (initially)}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18
\]
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 54
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many seats were occupied by the parents
One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
\[
\text{Occupied seats (parents)} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining seats}
\]
\[
\text{Occupied seats (parents)} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54
\]
\[
\text{Occupied seats (parents)} = 18
\]

### Step 5: Determine the number of seats left after parent occupancy
Subtract the occupied seats by the parents from the remaining seats.
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = \text{Remaining seats} - \text{Occupied seats (parents)}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 54 - 18
\]
\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 36
\]

### Step 6: Determine how many seats were occupied by the students
Since all other seats were occupied by the students, we have already accounted for all students' seats.
\[
\text{Occupied seats (students)} = \text{Remaining seats}
\]
\[
\text{Occupied seats (students)} = 36
\]

Therefore, the number of students who attended the event in the school auditorium is **36**.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total cost of physical therapy, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of hours John spent in therapy**
- John goes to physical therapy twice a week.
- Each session lasts 2 hours.

Number of sessions per week = 2
Duration per session (in hours) = 2

Total number of hours per week = Number of sessions per week * Duration per session (in hours)
= 2 * 2
= 4 hours

Since John attends physical therapy for 6 weeks:
Total number of hours over 6 weeks = Total number of hours per week * Number of weeks
= 4 * 6
= 24 hours

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the sessions**
- The cost per hour of each session is $125.

Cost per session = $125
Number of sessions per week = 2
Number of weeks = 6

Total cost per session = Cost per session * Number of sessions per week * Number of weeks
= $125 * 2 * 6
= $1250

Since there are two sessions per week:
Total cost of one week's sessions = Total cost per session * Number of sessions per week
= $1250 * 2
= $2500

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all sessions**
- We have calculated that John has six weeks of therapy, and each week costs $2500.

Total cost of all sessions = Total cost of one week's sessions * Number of weeks
= $2500 * 6
= $15000

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy is **$15000**.<|im_end|>","Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully:

### Step 1: Determine how much time Jim spends at school.
Jim spends 8 hours at school.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pieces of gum he chews at school.
He chews 1 piece for every 2 hours spent at school.
\[ \text{Pieces chewed at school} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

### Step 3: Add the pieces he chews on the way home from school.
He chews 1 more piece on the way home from school.
\[ \text{Total pieces chewed at school} = 4 + 1 = 5 \]

### Step 4: Add the pieces he chews after dinner.
He chews another piece after dinner.
\[ \text{Total pieces chewed after dinner} = 5 + 1 = 6 \]

### Step 5: Subtract the pieces given to his sister.
He gives half of what he has left to his sister.
\[ \text{Pieces given to sister} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ \text{Remaining pieces after giving to sister} = 6 - 3 = 3 \]

### Step 6: Calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the rest of the night.
Since he only chews during sleep (which we assume he doesn't), he does not chew any more pieces during the night.

### Final Answer:
Jim has **3** pieces of gum left at the end of the day.<|im_end|>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum

Solve for \( C \):
\[ C = 16 - 12 \]
\[ C = 4 \]

So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

**Step 2: Calculate Charmaine's age 4 years from now**
Since we know Charmaine is currently 4 years old, we add 4 to her current age.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach**

- Baseball coach buys 9 new baseballs.
- Each baseball costs $3.

Total cost for the baseball coach = Number of baseballs × Cost per baseball
= 9 × $3
= $27

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach**

- Basketball coach buys 8 new basketballs.
- Each basketball costs $14.

Total cost for the basketball coach = Number of basketballs × Cost per basketball
= 8 × $14
= $112

**Step 3: Determine how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach**

Difference in spending = Total cost for basketball coach - Total cost for baseball coach
= $112 - $27
= $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.<|im_end|>","The cost of the baseballs is 9 × $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of flowers in the garden**

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row.

\[
\text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Total number of flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

So, there are 200 flowers in the garden.

**Step 2: Calculate how many flowers have not yet bloomed**

According to the information provided, only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed.

\[
\text{Number of flowers that have not bloomed} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Total number of flowers}
\]

Substituting the value we found for the total number of flowers:

\[
\text{Number of flowers that have not bloomed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 200 = 40
\]

So, 40 flowers have not yet bloomed.

**Step 3: Determine how many flowers have bloomed**

Since only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed, we can calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed as follows:

\[
\text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total number of flowers}
\]

Substituting the value we found for the total number of flowers:

\[
\text{Number of flowers that have bloomed} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = 160
\]

Therefore, the number of flowers that have bloomed is **160**.

<|im_start|>system
To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in Mbps (megabits per second) and then convert it to MB per hour, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert KB per second to KB per hour
Ashley's internet connection speed is given as 20KB/s.

First, calculate how many seconds there are in an hour:
\[ 1 \text{ hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, multiply the rate by the number of seconds in one hour:
\[ 20 \text{ KB/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour} = 72000 \text{ KB/hour} \]

### Step 2: Convert KB per hour to MB per hour
We know that 1MB equals 1000KB. So, we can use this conversion factor to find out how many MB per hour:
\[ \frac{72000 \text{ KB}}{1000 \text{ KB/MB}} = 72 \text{ MB/hour} \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 megabytes per hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waiter
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the total number of cars towed over the course of the week.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cars towed per day for the first three days
- The tow truck pulls ten cars each day for the first three days.
  
  Number of cars per day for the first three days = 10 cars/day

### Step 2: Determine the number of cars towed per day for the remaining days of the week
- After the first three days, the number of cars decreases by four each day.

  Let's denote the number of days in the week as \( W \).
  
  For the last few days (after the third day), the number of cars can be represented as:
  
  - Day 4: 6 cars
  - Day 5: 6 cars
  - Day 6: 6 cars
  - Day 7: 6 cars
  
  This pattern continues until all seven days have been covered.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars towed during the first three days
- Since the tow truck pulls ten cars per day for the first three days:

  Total number of cars for the first three days = \( 10 \times 3 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cars towed during the remaining days
- We know there are seven days in total, so after the first three days, there are four days left.

  To find out how many cars were towed on these remaining days, we subtract the number of cars from the first three days from the total number of days:

  Total number of cars for the remaining days = \( 7 - 3 = 4 \) days

  Now, since the number of cars decreases by four each day starting from the fourth day onwards, we calculate the total number of cars for the remaining days using an arithmetic series formula or simply summing up the numbers:

  - Day 4: 6 cars
  - Day 5: 6 cars
  - Day 6: 6 cars
  - Day 7: 6 cars

  Sum of the numbers from 6 to 6 inclusive = \( 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 \) cars.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of cars towed during the entire week
- Add the number of cars towed during the first three days to the total number of cars towed during the remaining days:

  Total number of cars = \( (10 \times 3) + 18 \)

  Simplify the expression:

  Total number of cars = \( 30 + 18 \)
  
  Total number of cars = \( 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of cars towed during the entire week is **48**.<|im_end|>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many years until Adam can ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:**
   - Adam's height is given as 40 inches.
   - There are 12 inches in one foot.
   \[
   \text{Current height (feet)} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.\overline{3} \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the additional growth needed for Adam to reach the required height:**
   - The roller coaster requires a minimum height of 4 feet.
   - Current height: \( \frac{10}{3} \) feet.
   \[
   \text{Additional growth needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]
   - To subtract these fractions, convert 4 feet to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet}
     \]
   \[
   \text{Additional growth needed} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of years required for this growth:**
   - Adam grows 2 inches per year.
   - Each inch is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{12}\) of a foot.
   \[
   \text{Growth rate per year} = \frac{2 \text{ inches/year}}{\frac{1}{12} \text{ feet/inch}} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ feet/year}
   \]
   - Convert the annual growth into the total number of years required:
     \[
     \text{Years required} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{24 \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \div 24 = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{24} = \frac{2}{72} = \frac{1}{36} \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, Adam will need approximately 1 year to grow to the necessary height.

**Final Answer:** Adam will need \(\boxed{1}\) year to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.<|im_end|>","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total sales amount:**
   - James sold 10 cars.
   - Each car costs $25,000.
   - Total sales = 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

2. **Determine the acquisition cost from the company:**
   - The company pays 30% of the purchase price for the cars.
   - Purchase price per car = $25,000.
   - Company's payment (acquisition cost) per car = 30% * $25,000 = 0.30 * $25,000 = $7,500 per car.
   - Total acquisition cost = 10 * $7,500 = $75,000.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Sales amount - Acquisition cost.
   - Profit = $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

4. **Determine the commission rate:**
   - James receives a 10% commission on the profits.
   - Commission rate = 10%.

5. **Calculate the total commission:**
   - Total commission = Profit * Commission rate.
   - Total commission = $175,000 * 0.10 = $17,500.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the number of riders who can stay upright.
2. Determine the number of riders who are women.
3. Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders to find the number of men.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright

Given that only 25% of the riders can stay upright on waves over 30 feet, we can calculate this as follows:

\[ \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 0.25 \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 25 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of women among the riders who can stay upright

Of the riders who can stay upright (25), 60% are women. So,

\[ \text{Number of women} = 0.60 \times 25 \]

\[ \text{Number of women} = 15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of men among the riders who can stay upright

Subtracting the number of women from the total number of riders gives us the number of men:

\[ \text{Number of men} = 100 - 15 \]

\[ \text{Number of men} = 85 \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is \(85\).

**The final answer is:** The final answer is \(85\) men.<|im_end|>","25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**
   - We know that the price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.
   - Therefore, the price of the gold jewel can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Price of gold jewel} = 1600
     \]

2. **Calculate the price of the silver jewel:**
   - We are told that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel.
   - Using the price of the gold jewel we just determined (1600):
     \[
     \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1200
     \]

3. **Sum up the prices to find the total amount:**
   - Now, add the prices of the gold, diamond, and silver jewels together:
     \[
     \text{Total price} = \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel}
     \]
     Substituting in our values:
     \[
     \text{Total price} = 1600 + 2000 + 1200
     \]

### Step 1: Determine the total number of stamps
Max bought a total of 16 snowflake stamps.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of truck stamps
We know that Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
- Snowflake stamps = 16
- Truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rose stamps
We also know that Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.
- Truck stamps = 19
- Rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

### Step 4: Verify the total number of stamps
Let's add up all the stamps to ensure they sum up correctly:
- Snowflake stamps (16)
- Truck stamps (19)
- Rose stamps (10)

Total = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

Since the total should be 45, let's verify if there was any mistake. We see that our calculations are correct.

                    question:
                    Bob is 75 miles ahead of : Tom, driving ! 55 miles per : hour. ; Tom ! is driving 70 ! miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the relative speed:**
   - Bob's speed = 55 mph
   - Tom's speed = 70 mph
   - Relative speed (speed at which Tom is gaining on Bob) = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
     \[
     70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
     \]

2. **Determine the distance between them initially:**
   - The initial distance between Bob and Tom is given as 75 miles.

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Tom to close this gap:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}}
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.<|im_end|>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.
Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom, and if Tom is gaining 15 mph on him, it will take Tom 75 miles / 15 mph = <<75/15=5>>5 hours to catch up with Bob.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many fish Darren caught.
- We know that Naomi caught 17 fish.
- According to the information given, Darren caught 6 less than Naomi.

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 \]

Substituting the number of fish Naomi caught:

\[ \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Darren's fish} = 11 \]

So, Darren caught **11** fish.

### Step 2: Determine how many fish Tommy caught.
- It is stated that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 \]

Substituting the number of fish Darren caught:

\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught **14** fish.

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents don't sign him up again, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the maximum cost per class:**
   - The total cost for 10 classes is $60.
   - To find the maximum cost per class when it exceeds $10, divide the total cost by the number of classes.

\[
\text{Maximum Cost per Class} = \frac{\$60}{10}
\]

2. **Perform the division:**

\[
\text{Maximum Cost per Class} = \$6
\]

3. **Determine how many classes Manny can afford without exceeding this limit:**
   - Since Manny's maximum allowed cost per class is $6, and each class costs $6, he can only afford one class at a time.

4. **Calculate how many classes Manny has already taken:**
   - Manny signed up for 10 classes initially.

5. **Subtract the number of classes he has already taken from the total number of classes available:**
   - Total classes available: 10
   - Classes already taken: 10

Since Manny cannot take any additional classes after signing up for all 10 classes, he will not be able to continue taking classes beyond those he has already started.

Therefore, Manny cannot miss any classes because he would exceed his budget even if he misses just one class.

**Final Answer:** Manny cannot miss any classes. Therefore, the number of classes he can miss before his parents don't sign him up again is **0**.<|im_end|>","He must attend at least six classes, because 60 / 6 = <<60/6=10>>10

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Jewel's daily processing rate**:
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Calculate Julie's processing rate**:
   - Julie processes twice as fast as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

3. **Calculate their combined daily processing rate**:
   - Combined, they process \(50 + 100 = 150\) customers per day.

4. **Calculate the number of days in a week**:
   - There are 7 days in a week.

5. **Calculate the total weekly production**:
   - Together, they can process \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) customers per week.

6. **Verify the calculations**:
   - Since we've already calculated that together they process 150 customers per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply to confirm: \(150 \times 7 = 1050\).

Therefore, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel working all days of the week is 1050 customers.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price per apple:**
   - We know that four apples cost $5.20.
   - To find the price per apple, divide the total cost by the number of apples.

\[
\text{Price per apple} = \frac{\$5.20}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Price per apple} = \$1.30
\]

2. **Calculate the price per orange:**
   - We know that three oranges cost $3.30.
   - To find the price per orange, divide the total cost by the number of oranges.

\[
\text{Price per orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Price per orange} = \$1.10
\]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 apples:**
   - The price per apple is $1.30.
   - Multiply this by the number of apples (which is 5).

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 apples} = \$6.50
\]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges:**
   - The price per orange is $1.10.
   - Multiply this by the number of oranges (which is 5).

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = \$5.50
\]

5. **Add the costs together:**
   - Add the total cost for the apples and the total cost for the oranges.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$6.50 + \$5.50

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of the hole that Bob needs to dig and then calculate how long it will take him to shovel that volume of earth.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Hole

The hole has dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Depth (D) = 3 feet

The formula for the volume (V) of a rectangular prism (which the hole can be approximated as) is:

\[ V = L \times W \times D \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

### Step 2: Determine the Time Required to Shovel the Earth

Bob's rate of shoveling is 3 seconds per cubic foot. Therefore, if he digs at this rate, the time required \( T \) to shovel the entire volume of the hole can be calculated using the formula:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Rate}} \]

Given:
- Volume = 72 cubic feet
- Rate = 3 seconds per cubic foot

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ T = \frac{72 \, \text{cubic feet}}{3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot}} \]
\[ T = 24 \, \text{seconds} \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, it will take Bob **24 seconds** to dig the hole.

\[
\boxed{24 \, \text{seconds}}
\]<|im_end|>","The hole is 6 feet long by 4 feet wide by 3 feet deep or 6 * 4 * 3 = <<6*4*3=72>>72 cubic feet.

To determine the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to consider both the base price and any additional costs for the various features he wants to add.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Base Price**:
   - The base price of the truck is $30,000.

2. **King Cab Upgrade**:
   - The king cab upgrade adds $7,500.
   
3. **Leather Seats**:
   - Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
     \[
     \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{7,500}{3} = 2,500
     \]

4. **Running Boards**:
   - Running boards are $500 cheaper than leather seats.
     \[
     \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
     \]

5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**:
   - The upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

6. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - Add all these components together to find the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Base Price} + (\text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30,000 + (7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500)
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30,000 + (13,500)
   \]
   Adding these amounts:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30,000 + 13,500 = 43,500

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tim's annual income after receiving the promotion offer. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the monthly increase due to the raise:**
   - Tim currently earns $20,000 per month.
   - The raise is 5%, so we first find 5% of his current salary:
     \[
     0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
     \]
   - This means his new monthly salary will be:
     \[
     20000 + 1000 = 21000
     \]

2. **Determine the monthly bonus amount:**
   - The bonus is worth half of his current monthly salary ($20,000).
   - Half of $20,000 is:
     \[
     \frac{20000}{2} = 10000
     \]

3. **Calculate the total monthly earnings after considering both the raise and the bonus:**
   - After the raise, his monthly salary becomes $21,000.
   - Adding the bonus increases this to:
     \[
     21000 + 10000 = 31000
     \]

4. **Calculate the annual earnings based on the monthly rate:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so his yearly earnings would be:
     \[
     31000 \times 12 = 372000
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tim will make in a year is \(372000\).

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is 372000.<|im_end|>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all items purchased by James. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of suits
James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
\[ \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times \$750 = \$7500 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of dress pants
Each suit comes with 10 dress pants, but we're not given their individual cost. However, we know that the dress pants cost $1/5 the cost of one suit.
\[ \text{Cost of one suit} = \$750 \]
\[ \text{Cost of one dress pant} = \frac{\$750}{5} = \$150 \]
Since there are 10 dress pants for each suit,
\[ \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times \$150 = \$1500 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost before calculating shirts
Now, add up the costs of suits and dress pants.
\[ \text{Total cost (suits + dress pants)} = \$7500 + \$1500 = \$9000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of dress shirts bought
James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he has 10 suits,
\[ \text{Number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts
Each dress shirt costs $60.
\[ \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times \$60 = \$1800 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of articles published per day by both websites.

- Website A publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
- Website B publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

Total number of articles published per day by both websites = 
\[ \text{Articles from A} + \text{Articles from B} \]
\[ = 20 + 10 \]
\[ = 30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles published over the entire month of February (which has 28 days).

Number of articles published by both websites in one day × Number of days in February
\[ = 30 \times 28 \]
\[ = 840 \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is **840**.<|im_end|>","In February, with 28 days, the political and weather publishing news website produced a total of 28*20=<<28*20=560>>560 articles.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Steve, his wife, his son, and his son's wife.

1. **Determine Steve's age**:
   - Steve is 60 years old.

2. **Determine Steve's wife's age**:
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve.
   \[
   \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the son's age**:
   - The son is currently half as old as his mother.
   - Since Steve's wife (64) is twice as old as the son (let's call the son's age \( x \)):
   \[
   64 = 2x \implies x = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years}
   \]
   So, the son is 32 years old.

4. **Determine the son's wife's age**:
   - The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son).
   \[
   \text{Son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, the son's wife is 29 years old.<|im_end|>","Steve's wife is 60+4=<<60+4=64>>64 years old.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of flour in one portion:**
   - We know that 2 kilograms of flour is divided into 8 portions.
   - Therefore, the amount of flour per portion is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Flour per portion} = \frac{\text{Total flour}}{\text{Number of portions}} = \frac{2 \text{ kg}}{8} = 0.25 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour in three bags:**
   - Each bag contains the same amount of flour as one portion.
   - Therefore, for three bags, the total amount of flour is:
     \[
     \text{Total flour in three bags} = 3 \times \text{Flour per portion} = 3 \times 0.25 \text{ kg} = 0.75 \text{ kg}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then sum those distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Alisa traveled**

- Alisa's speed = 12 miles/hour
- Time Alisa spent biking = 4.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Alisa's Distance} = 12 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Alisa's Distance} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Stanley traveled**

- Stanley's speed = 10 miles/hour
- Time Stanley spent biking = 2.5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time

\[ \text{Stanley's Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2.5 \text{ hours} \]

\[ \text{Stanley's Distance} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Sum the distances**

Total Distance = Alisa's Distance + Stanley's Distance

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \text{ miles} + 25 \text{ miles} \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley together covered a total distance of **79 miles**.<|im_end|>","Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles

                    question:
                    ; Bill ? is trying to dig : a well in his ! backyard. He can dig 4 . feet/hour through soil and ; half that fast ! through : clay. If he has ! to ! dig , through 24 feet of soil ? and ! 8 ; feet . of clay, ? how , long . will it ! take ; him ? to ! dig the ? well?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time Bill needs to dig through both soil and clay.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to dig through the soil.
Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour for soil. We have a total of 24 feet of soil to dig.

\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{\text{Total Soil Length}}{\text{Soil Digging Rate}} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time to dig soil} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to dig through the clay.
For the clay, Bill's digging speed is halved from his soil digging speed (since clay is denser). Therefore, his digging rate for clay is:

\[ \text{Clay Digging Rate} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ feet/hour} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]

We have an additional 8 feet of clay to dig.

\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{\text{Total Clay Length}}{\text{Clay Digging Rate}} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time to dig clay} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time required.
Now, add the times calculated for soil and clay to get the total time Bill needs to complete the well.

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time to dig soil} + \text{Time to dig clay} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

### Conclusion:
It will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well through both soil and clay. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10 \text{ hours}}
\]<|im_end|>","First find how fast Bill can dig through clay: 4 feet/hour / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 feet/hour

Then find how long he spends digging through soil in total: 24 feet / 4 feet/hour = <<24/4=6>>6 hours
Then add the time he spends digging through soil and clay to find the total digging time: 4 hours + 6 hours = <<4+6=10>>10 hours

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cupcakes required based on the given conditions.

1. **Identify the total number of people in the class:**
   - There are 26 people (Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates).

2. **Determine the number of cupcakes per person:**
   - Howie wants to buy one cupcake for himself.
   - His teacher also wants one cupcake.
   - The remaining 25 classmates each want one cupcake.

3. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed:**
   - Each of the 26 people wants one cupcake.
   \[
   \text{Total cupcakes} = 26 \times 1 = 26
   \]

4. **Verify the condition about buying one of each flavor:**
   - Since there are two flavors available (vanilla and chocolate), Howie can choose either flavor for the cupcakes he buys.
   - For example, he could buy 10 vanilla cupcakes and 16 chocolate cupcakes, or vice versa, but the total number of cupcakes remains 26.

Therefore, the total number of cupcakes Howie should buy is 26.

2. **Determine the increase in likes over time:**
   - The number of likes increased by 70 times the initial number of likes.
   
3. **Calculate the current total number of likes:**
   - Add the increase in likes to the initial number of likes.

4. **Add the additional 20000 likes:**

Let's go through these steps systematically:

### Step 1: Initial Number of Likes
- Initial number of likes = 2000 (after one week)

### Step 2: Increase in Likes Over Time
- Increase in likes = 70 × initial number of likes
- Increase in likes = 70 × 2000 = 140,000

### Step 3: Current Total Number of Likes
- Current total number of likes = initial number + increase in likes
- Current total number of likes = 2000 + 140,000 = 142,000

### Step 4: Adding Additional 20000 Likes
- Final total number of likes = current total + additional 20000 likes
- Final total number of likes = 142,000 + 20,000 = 162,000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost on Tuesday.
Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \times 20 = \$400
\]

She received a $2 off voucher, so we need to subtract that from her total cost.

\[
\text{Final cost after voucher} = \$400 - \$2 = \$398
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the final cost on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the price increased to $30 per fruit, but there was an additional 10% discount on the total cost.

First, calculate the new total cost before applying the discount.

\[
\text{New total cost} = 20 \times 30 = \$600
\]

Next, apply the 10% discount.

\[
\text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
\]

Subtract the discount from the new total cost:

\[
\text{Final cost on Wednesday} = 600 - 60 = \$540
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in final costs over the two days.
Now, we find the difference between the final costs calculated on both days.

\[
\text{Difference} = 540 - 398 = \$142
\]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is **$142**.<|im_end|>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define some variables for clarity:
- \( R \) = Total sales from red hats in one month (given as $400)
- \( G \) = Total sales from green hats in one month (unknown at this point)
- \( T \) = Total sales from both types of hats in one month (total sales in one month)

### Step 2: Determine Sales from Green Hats
According to the problem, the sales from green hats are half of the sales from red hats:
\[ G = \frac{R}{2} \]
Given that \( R = 400 \):
\[ G = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Sales per Month
The total sales per month (\( T \)) can be calculated as follows:
\[ T = R + G \]
Substituting the values:
\[ T = 400 + 200 = 600 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Second Month's Sales
The problem states that in the second month, sales were \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total sales from the first month:
\[ S_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times T \]
Substituting the value of \( T \):
\[ S_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times 600 \]
\[ S_2 = 450 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Sales Over Two Months
Now, we add the sales from the first month and the second month to get the total sales over two months:
\[ T_{\text{total}} = T + S_2 \]
Substituting the values:
\[ T_{\text{total}} = 600 + 450 \]
\[ T_{\text{total}} = 1050 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount Ariadne made in two months is:
\[

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, so the total time is:
\[ 9 \text{ PM} - 5 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours charged
Since there's an extra hour free, the number of hours charged is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour free} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Compute the payment
- The first paid hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous one.

Let's calculate the cost for each of the three hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \)
- Third hour: \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \)

Now, sum up all the charges:
\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \]

Therefore, James pays:
\[
\boxed{105}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount in Sally's bank account:**
   - At the beginning of the week, her bank account had $200.
   - After receiving wages for the week, her bank account now holds $420.

2. **Calculate the total amount of wages earned during the week:**
   - The difference between her current balance and the initial balance gives us the total amount of wages earned.
   \[
   \text{Total Wages Earned} = \$420 - \$200 = \$220
   \]

3. **Determine the total weekly wage that should have been received:**
   - According to the information given, the total weekly wage should be $300.

4. **Calculate the amount of wages withheld:**
   - Subtract the actual wages earned from the expected total weekly wage.
   \[
   \text{Amount Withheld} = \$300 - \$220 = \$80

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of deviled egg halves per guest**

Lori expects each guest to eat 3 deviled egg halves.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves for all guests**

She is expecting 16 guests, so we multiply the number of halves per guest by the total number of guests.
\[ \text{Total deviled egg halves} = 16 \times 3 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]
So, Lori needs 48 deviled egg halves in total.

**Step 3: Determine how many eggs are required based on the ratio given (1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves)**

Given that one whole egg can produce 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs correspond to 48 halves.

First, calculate the number of whole eggs from 48 deviled egg halves:
\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]
Therefore, Lori needs 24 whole eggs to prepare the deviled eggs.

**Step 4: Convert the number of eggs to dozens**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to convert them to dozens.
\[ \frac{24}{12} = 2 \]
So, Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is: **The final answer is 2 dozens of eggs**.<|im_end|>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sheila has left to write after she has completed 1/3 of her 15-page research paper.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages already written.
Sheila has already written 1/3 of the total 15-page paper. To find out how many pages that is, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Pages already written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication.
\[ \text{Pages already written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

So, Sheila has written 5 pages so far.

Step 3: Determine the remaining number of pages to be written.
Since the entire paper consists of 15 pages, we subtract the number of pages already written from the total number of pages:
\[ \text{Pages left to write} = 15 - 5 \]
\[ \text{Pages left to write} = 10 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of pages in the book:**
   - The book has 200 pages.

2. **Calculate how many days Mike has until the deadline:**
   - The deadline is 30 days from now.
   - Therefore, Mike has 30 days minus the time he already spent on other activities or personal matters.

3. **Calculate how many pages Mike can read per day:**
   - Mike reads 10 pages a day.

4. **Calculate how many days it will take Mike to complete all 200 pages:**
   - To find out how many days it takes to read all 200 pages at 10 pages per day, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages Mike reads per day.

   - Mike has 30 days until the deadline but needs only 20 days to finish reading.
   - Therefore, the number of days before the deadline Mike will finish reading is:
     \[
     \text{Days before deadline} = \text{Deadline days} - \text{Days needed to finish reading} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly maintenance cost.
James pays $5000 per month for renting a hangar.

Step 2: Determine the monthly fuel cost.
He spends twice as much as he does on renting the hangar on fuel per month.

\[
\text{Fuel Cost per Month} = 2 \times \$5000 = \$10,000
\]

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly maintenance and fuel costs.
Total monthly maintenance and fuel cost:

\[
\$5000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the annual maintenance and fuel costs.
There are 12 months in a year, so multiply the monthly total by 12.

\[
\text{Annual Maintenance and Fuel Costs} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total initial purchase cost.
James initially bought the plane for $150,000.

### Step 6: Add up all costs over the course of one year.
First year's total cost includes both the initial purchase cost and the yearly maintenance and fuel costs.

\[
\text{Total Annual Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total amount James spent to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $\boxed{\$330,000}$.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Finley bought rice, beans, and pork.
   - It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.
   - Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.
   - It took her 30 minutes to cook rice.

2. **Determine the time taken to cook rice:**
   - Given that it takes her 30 minutes to cook rice.

3. **Calculate the time taken to cook pork:**
   - Pork takes 20 more minutes to cook than rice.
   - Therefore, pork takes \(30 + 20 = 50\) minutes to cook.

4. **Define variables for the times:**
   - Let \(R\) be the time (in minutes) to cook rice.
   - Let \(P\) be the time (in minutes) to cook pork.
   - Let \(B\) be the time (in minutes) to cook beans.

5. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - \(P = R + 20\)
   - \(B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R)\)

6. **Substitute the known values into these equations:**
   - From \(P = R + 20\), we get \(P = 50\).
   - Substitute \(P = 50\) into the second equation: 
     \[
     B = \frac{1}{2}((50) + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + R)
     \]

7. **Solve for \(R\) using the total time for all three foods:**
   - The total time spent cooking all three items should equal the total time she had available.
   - She has 20 extra minutes for cooking pork plus beans, so the total time available minus the time spent on rice is 20 minutes less than the total time needed for all three items.
   - Total time available = Time spent on rice + Time spent on pork + Time spent on beans + Extra time.
   - Since it takes 30 minutes to cook rice, the total time required for all items is \(30 + P + B\).

8. **Express the total time as an equation:**
   - \(30 + 50 + B = 30 + 50 + \left(\frac{1}{2}(50 + R)\right)\)

9. **Simplify and solve for \(R\):**
   - Simplifying the right side gives us:
     \[
     30 + 50 + B = 80 + \left(\frac{1}{2}(50 + R)\right)
     \]
   - This simplifies further to:
     \[
     80 + \left(\frac{1}{2}(50 + R)\right) = 80 + 25 + \frac{R}{2}
     \]
   - So, we have:
     \[
     105 + \frac{R}{2} = 30 + 50 + B
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides, we get:
     \[
     105 + \frac{R}{2} = 80 + B
     \]
   - Rearranging terms, we find:
     \[
     B = 105 + \frac{R}{2} - 80
     \]
     \[
     B = 25 + \frac{R}{2}
     \]

10. **Find the value of \(R\):**
    - We know from earlier that \(P = R + 20 = 50\). Solving for \(R\):
      \[
      R = 50 - 20 = 30
      \]

11. **Calculate the remaining times:**
    - Now, substitute \(R = 30\) back into our expressions:
      \[
      B = 25 + \frac{30}{2} = 25 + 15 = 40
      \]
      \[
      P = 50
      \]

12. **Summarize the times:**
    - Rice: 30 minutes
    - Pork: 50 minutes
    - Beans: 40 minutes

13. **Final calculation:**
    - Total time spent cooking all food:
      \[
      30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
      \]

**Therefore**, the final answer is: {","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.
The total cooking time for pork and rice is 50+30 = <<50+30=80>>80 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of two different mixtures and then find the difference between them.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first mixture**

- **Almonds**: The cost per pound is $10.
- **Walnuts**: The cost per pound is $15.

For half a pound of almonds and one-third of a pound of walnuts:

\[
\text{Cost} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \$10\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \$15\right)
\]

First, calculate the cost of almonds:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \$10 = \$5
\]

Next, calculate the cost of walnuts:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \$5
\]

Now, add these together:

\[
\$5 (almonds) + \$5 (walnuts) = \$10
\]

So, the total cost for the first mixture is $10.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second mixture**

- **Almonds**: The cost per pound is $10.
- **Walnuts**: The cost per pound is $15.

For one-fifth of a pound of almonds and one-third of a pound of walnuts:

\[
\text{Cost} = \left(\frac{1}{5} \times \$10\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times \$15\right)
\]

First, calculate the cost of almonds:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times \$10 = \$2
\]

Next, calculate the cost of walnuts:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \$15 = \$5
\]

Now, add these together:

\[
\$2 (almonds) + \$5 (walnuts) = \$7
\]

So, the total cost for the second mixture is $7.

**Step 3: Find the difference in cost**

Subtract the cost of the second mixture from the first mixture:

\[
\$10 - \$7 = \$3
\]

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is $\boxed{\$3}$<|im_end|>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.

So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep living on Lee's farm given that the total number of animal legs is 70 and the total number of animal heads is 20.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of Sheep**: Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep.
2. **Number of Geese**: Let \( G \) represent the number of geese.
3. **Legs per Animal**:
   - Each sheep has 4 legs.
   - Each goose has 2 legs.
4. **Total Legs Equation**: The total number of legs from both animals equals 70.
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

5. **Total Heads Equation**: The total number of heads from both animals equals 20.
\[ S + G = 20 \]

Now, let's solve these equations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Solve for one variable in terms of another using the second equation (total heads).
From the total heads equation:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
We can express \( G \) as:
\[ G = 20 - S \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( G \) into the legs equation.
Substitute \( G \) from the above expression into the legs equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Expand and combine like terms:
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]

### Step 4: Isolate \( S \).
Subtract 40 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 30 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ S = 15 \]

So, there are 15 sheep on Lee’s farm.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 15 sheep live on Lee's farm.<|im_end|>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many pounds of coffee Roger needs.
2. Calculate the cost of the cheaper brand of coffee per pound.
3. Calculate the total cost of the cheaper brand of coffee.
4. Calculate the additional amount spent on the more expensive brand.
5. Add the cost of the donuts.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Determine how many pounds of coffee Roger needs
Roger plans to buy enough coffee to last him a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, he will need 7 pounds of coffee.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cheaper brand of coffee per pound
The normal price of coffee is $5 per pound. However, Roger only needs 7 pounds (since he plans to buy enough to last a week), so he can purchase the cheaper brand at the regular price.

Cost of 7 pounds of coffee = \( 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$5/\text{pound} = \$35 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the cheaper brand of coffee
Since the cheaper brand costs $5 per pound, the total cost for 7 pounds would be:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$5/\text{pound} = \$35 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the additional amount spent on the more expensive brand
The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the cheaper brand. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand per pound is:
\[ \$5 \times 1.20 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Now, calculate the total cost of the more expensive brand:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

### Step 5: Add the cost of the donuts
Roger spends an extra $2 on donuts.

Total cost = Cost of coffee + Cost of more expensive brand + Cost of donuts
\[ \$35 + \$42 + \$2 = \$89 \]

So, the total cost of everything is **$89**.<|im_end|>","The coffee he bought was 5*.2=$<<5*.2=1>>1 more expensive per pound than what he normally buys

So he paid 6*7=$<<6*7=42>>42 on coffee
That means his total bill was 42+2=$<<42+2=44>>44

                    Gus , spent $20.00 at the grocery , store.  He bought ? 2 ! bag of chips ! for $2.00 each, a : bucket of fried chicken for , $8.00 ! and a bottle ; of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Gus spent on apples and then subtract that from his total spending to find out how much he spent on the apple pie.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on chips.
Gus bought two bags of chips, each costing $2.00.
Total spent on chips = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Step 2: Add the cost of the fried chicken to the total spent on chips.
Fried chicken costs $8.00.
Total spent so far = $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) = $12.00

Step 3: Subtract the total spent on chips and fried chicken from the overall total spent.
Total spent on all items except the apple pie = $12.00
Remaining amount after purchasing chips and fried chicken = $12.00 - $12.00 = $0.00

This means that Gus has exactly used up his remaining budget without buying anything else.

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie must be $0.00.

Final Answer: The final answer is The apple pie cost $0.00.<|im_end|>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00

He spent $20.00 and all of the groceries, except for the pie cost $13.00 so that means the apple pie cost 20-13 = $<<20-13=7.00>>7.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of newspapers delivered.
James delivers a total of 600 newspapers.

Step 2: Identify the number of newspapers delivered to District A.
James delivers 198 newspapers to District A.

Step 3: Calculate the number of newspapers delivered to District B and District C.
We know that the total number of newspapers delivered (600) is equal to the sum of the newspapers delivered to District A, District B, and District C. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total newspapers} = \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District B} + \text{Newspapers to District C} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 600 = 198 + \text{Newspapers to District B} + 209 \]

Step 4: Solve for the number of newspapers delivered to District B.
First, combine the numbers on the right side of the equation:

\[ 600 = 198 + \text{Newspapers to District B} + 209 \]
\[ 600 = 407 + \text{Newspapers to District B} \]

Next, isolate the variable (the number of newspapers delivered to District B):

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.

Final Answer: The final answer is 193.<|im_end|>","He delivers to District A and C a total of 198+209 = <<198+209=407>>407 newspapers

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many recipes John can learn based on the given information.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of class sessions.
- There are 4 meetings per week.
- Each meeting lasts for 2 hours.
- John takes classes for 6 weeks.

First, calculate the total number of class sessions in one week:
\[ \text{Sessions per week} = 4 \]

Next, multiply that by the number of weeks:
\[ \text{Total sessions} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Now, calculate the total number of class sessions over the 6-week period:
\[ \text{Total sessions (6 weeks)} = 24 \times 6 = 144 \]

Step 2: Determine how many recipes John learns.
- John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time.

First, find out how many recipes John can learn from all these sessions combined:
\[ \text{Recipes learned} = \frac{\text{Total sessions}}{\text{Hours per recipe}} \]
\[ \text{Recipes learned} = \frac{144}{1.5} \]

Perform the division:
\[ \text{Recipes learned} = \frac{144}{1.5} = 96 \]

So, John learns 96 different recipes during the class.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of history teachers:**
   - The total number of teachers on the basketball court is 150.
   - 60% of these teachers are history teachers.

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = \frac{60}{100} \times 150 = 90
\]

2. **Calculate the number of math teachers:**
   - Since the rest of the teachers (i.e., not history teachers) are math teachers,
   - We can subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers.

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

3. **Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers:**
   - Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day.
   - Therefore, if there are 60 math teachers,

\[
\text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

4. **Conclusion:**

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(360\) hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: 360 hours.<|im_end|>","The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine Kassidy's amount**

Given that Aurelia (A) has $120, we need to find out how much Kassidy (K) has.

We know that Kassidy has \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as much money as Aurelia.
\[ \text{Kassidy's amount} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Aurelia's amount} \]

Substitute Aurelia's amount ($120):
\[ \text{Kassidy's amount} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Kassidy's amount} = 90 \]

So, Kassidy has $90.

**Step 2: Determine Rayna's amount**

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.
\[ \text{Rayna's amount} = \text{Kassidy's amount} + 60 \]
\[ \text{Rayna's amount} = 90 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Rayna's amount} = 150 \]

So, Rayna has $150.

**Step 3: Calculate total money**

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money when they decide to add together their money.
\[ \text{Total money} = \text{Kassidy's amount} + \text{Rayna's amount} + \text{Aurelia's amount} \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 90 + 150 + 120 \]
\[ \text{Total money} = 360 \]

So, the total amount of money is $360.

**Step 4: Share equally among three people**

Finally, we'll divide the total money by 3 to see how much each person gets.
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Amount per person} = \frac{360}{3} \]
\[ \text{Amount per person} = 120 \]

Therefore, each person will get $120.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{120}$.<|im_end|>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90

\[ \text{Total cost for candy type B} = 10 \times 0.75 \]

Step 3: Add the costs of both types of candies to find the total amount spent.
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = (7 \times 0.5) + (10 \times 0.75) \]

Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from the amount Adam paid to find the change.
\[ \text{Change received} = \$15 - \text{Total amount spent} \]

Now let's perform these calculations:

Step 1 Calculation:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]
So, the total cost for candy type A is $3.5.

Step 2 Calculation:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]
So, the total cost for candy type B is $7.5.

Step 3 Calculation:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]
So, the total amount spent is $11.

Step 4 Calculation:
\[ \$15 - 11 = \$4 \]
So, Adam received $4 in change.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$4}
\]<|im_end|>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

                    Christina records her mood every day on a calendar. Over the past thirty days of moods, she had twelve good ? days and eight bad . days and : the rest were neutral. Her first eight days were good, her second eight ! days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many good days Christina has left in the month, let's follow these steps:

1. **Total Days Recorded**: 
   - Christina recorded her mood for 30 days.

2. **Days of Each Mood**:
   - Good: 12 days
   - Bad: 8 days
   - Neutral: 14 days (since \(30 - 12 - 8 = 14\))

3. **Initial Distribution**:
   - First 8 days: Good
   - Next 8 days: Bad
   - Last 8 days: Neutral

4. **Given Additional Moods**:
   - The next three days will be distributed as follows: one good, two neutral.

5. **Calculate Remaining Good Days**:
   - Initially, there were 12 good days.
   - Out of the first 8 days, all were good.
   - Out of the next 8 days, half were bad (i.e., 4), so 2 more could be good or neutral, but we need to consider the distribution of the last three days.

6. **Distribute the Third Set of Days**:
   - Given that the next three days include one good and two neutral, we can distribute them as follows:
     - One good day from the previous set (first 8 days)
     - Two neutral days from the previous set (next 8 days)

7. **Summarize Good Days**:
   - Total good days initially: 12
   - Add the new good days: 1 + 2 = 3
   - Total good days now: 12 + 3 = 15

Therefore, the total number of good days remaining in the month is \(\boxed{15}\).<|im_end|>","Christina had 30 - 12 - 8 = <<30-12-8=10>>10 neutral days in the month.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Sally has given that Janey has 21 books and Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has.

Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has.
- According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be expressed as: 
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

where \( J \) represents the number of books Janey has.

### Step 2: Use Given Information
We know from the problem statement that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we substitute \( J = 21 \) into our equation:
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( S \)
Now, let’s solve for \( S \):

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
   \[ 18 = 2S \]

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
   \[ 9 = S \]

Therefore, Sally has **9** books.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Convert units for consistency**:
   - The initial height is given in feet.
   - We need to convert this to inches because the growth rate is provided in inches per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of inches needed**:
   - Convert the current height from feet to inches.
   - Calculate the difference between the desired height (in inches) and the current height (in inches).

3. **Determine the daily growth rate**:
   - Use the growth rate information to find out how much the plant grows per day.

4. **Calculate the number of days required to reach the desired height**:
   - Divide the total number of inches needed by the daily growth rate.

Let's go through these steps:

### Step 1: Convert the initial height from feet to inches
- Current height = 20 feet
- Conversion factor: 1 foot = 12 inches
- So, 20 feet = 20 × 12 = 240 inches

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of inches needed
- Desired height = 600 inches
- Total inches needed = 600 inches (desired height) - 240 inches (current height)
- Total inches needed = 600 - 240 = 360 inches

### Step 3: Determine the daily growth rate
- Growth rate = 30 inches/day

### Step 4: Calculate the number of days required
- Number of days = Total inches needed / Daily growth rate
- Number of days = 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days

Therefore, it will take **12 days** for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches tall.<|im_end|>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.
So, the bamboo needs to grow 600 - 240 = <<600-240=360>>360 inches more.
Therefore, it will take 360/30 = <<360/30=12>>12 days for its height to be 600 inches.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of toys:**
   - James currently has 4 toys.
   
2. **Number of dogs before buying additional toys:**
   - There are 4 dogs initially.

3. **Total toys needed for all dogs:**
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 4 toys for the current 4 dogs.

4. **Additional toys required:**
   - James already has 4 toys, which is enough for the current 4 dogs.
   - He still needs \(4 - 4 = 0\) more toys because he already has enough for the current 4 dogs.

5. **Dogs after buying additional toys:**
   - The number of dogs increases from 4 to 4 + (number of new dogs).
   - Let's denote the number of new dogs as \(x\). So, \(4 + x\) dogs will be present.

6. **After buying toys, the situation changes:**
   - Now, he sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - This means \(4 + x = 2 \times (\text{original number of dogs})\).

7. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - From \(4 + x = 2 \times 4\), we get \(x = 2 \times 4 - 4 = 4\).
   - So, James bought 4 more toys.

8. **Total number of toys James has:**
   - Initially, he had 4 toys.
   - He buys 4 more toys.
   - Total toys = 4 (initial) + 4 (bought) = 8 toys.

9. **Final number of dogs:**
   - If James bought 4 more toys, the total number of dogs would be \(4 + 4 = 8\).
   - But then, 3 dogs were taken away, so he only has \(8 - 3 = 5\) dogs left.

So, James has 5 dogs remaining, and therefore, he needs another 3 toys to meet the requirement for these dogs.

To determine how much money Skyler invested, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total initial investment.
The total initial investment from three people is $1200.

### Step 2: Determine Dylan's Investment.
Dylan invests \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount into the joint savings account.
\[ \text{Dylan's Investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 \]
\[ \text{Dylan's Investment} = \frac{2400}{5} \]
\[ \text{Dylan's Investment} = 480 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after Dylan’s investment.
Subtract Dylan's investment from the total initial investment.
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 1200 - 480 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 720 \]

### Step 4: Determine Frances' Investment.
Frances invests \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount into the joint savings account.
\[ \text{Frances' Investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 \]
\[ \text{Frances' Investment} = \frac{1440}{3} \]
\[ \text{Frances' Investment} = 480 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining amount after Frances’ investment.
Subtract Frances' investment from the remaining amount.
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 720 - 480 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 240 \]

### Step 6: Determine Skyler's Investment.
Skyler invests the remaining amount into the joint savings account.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much Lorie earns per hour.
Lorie earns $10 per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate how much Lorie earns in one day.
Since Lorie works for 8 hours (assuming an average workday):
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$10 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$80 \]

### Step 3: Determine how much Karen earns per hour.
Karen earns twice as much as Lorie:
\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \text{Lorie's hourly wage} \]
\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \$10 \]
\[ \text{Karen's hourly wage} = \$20 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how much Karen earns in one day.
Karen works for 3 hours per day:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$20 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = \$60 \]

### Step 5: Calculate how much Karen earns over two days.
If Karen works for 3 hours per day for two days:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$60 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$120 \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes when 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.

1. **Determine the number of hash browns per potato:**
   - We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.
   - Therefore, for one potato, it would make \( \frac{36}{6} = 6 \) hash browns.

2. **Calculate the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes:**
   - Since each potato yields 6 hash browns, for 96 potatoes, the total number of hash browns would be \( 96 \times 6 \).

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[ 96 \times 6 = 576 \]

So, the calculation shows that if you have 96 potatoes, you can make 576 hash browns.

### Conclusion:

To determine if Jack and his 8 other adults exceed the elevator's maximum load, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of Jack and his 9 companions.
2. Compare this total weight to the elevator's maximum load.

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the total weight:**
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - There are 9 people (Jack + 8 others).

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Weight per person}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \, \text{kg}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 720 \, \text{kg}
\]

2. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum load:**
   - The elevator can support up to 700 kg.
   - They have a total weight of 720 kg.

Since 720 kg exceeds 700 kg, their combined weight would cause the elevator to be overloaded.

**Final Answer:**
They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by \(720 - 700 = 20\) kg.<|im_end|>","Jack and 8 other adults form a total of 8 adults + 1 adult = <<8+1=9>>9 adults.

                    Katarina has 5 , less cookies than Max has. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Summer ; has 23 more cookies ! than Max. If Katarina has 68 cookies, how many cookies do they have in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cookies each person has based on the given relationships between their cookie collections.

Step 1: Determine the number of cookies Max has.
Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max's amount. Let \( M \) represent the number of cookies Max has. We can set up an equation:

\[ 68 = M - 5 \]

Solving for \( M \):

\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Let \( CM \) represent the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has. We can set up another equation:

\[ 73 = CM + 12 \]

Solving for \( CM \):

\[ CM = 73 - 12 \]
\[ CM = 61 \]

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Step 3: Determine the number of cookies Summer has.
Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Since we already know Max has 73 cookies, let \( S \) represent the number of cookies Summer has. We can set up a third equation:

\[ 73 = S + 23 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = 73 - 23 \]
\[ S = 50 \]

So, Summer has 50 cookies.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies.
Now that we know the number of cookies each person has, we can find the total by adding them together:

\[ Total = K + M + CM + S \]
\[ Total = 68 + 73 + 61 + 50 \]

Adding these values:

\[ Total = 252 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 252.<|im_end|>","Max’s has a total of 68+5 = <<68+5=73>>73 cookies.
Cookie Monster’s total amount of cookies is 73-12 = <<73-12=61>>61.

Total amount of cookies 68+73+61+96 = <<68+73+61+96=298>>298.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to determine the original length of the dress before any modifications were made.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length.
2. She adds an additional 20 cm to the bottom of the dress.
3. The final length of the dress after these modifications is 140 cm.

We can set up an equation to represent the total length of the dress after all modifications:

\[ \text{Final Length} = \text{Original Length} + (0.5 \times \text{Original Length}) + 20 \]

Given that the final length is 140 cm, we can substitute this value into our equation:

\[ 140 = \text{Original Length} + (0.5 \times \text{Original Length}) + 20 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 140 = \text{Original Length} + 0.5 \times \text{Original Length} + 20 \]
\[ 140 - 20 = 1.5 \times \text{Original Length} \]
\[ 120 = 1.5 \times \text{Original Length} \]

Now, solve for the Original Length:

\[ \text{Original Length} = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ \text{Original Length} = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was **80 cm**.<|im_end|>","Without the lace trim, the dress is 140cm full length – 20cm lace trim = <<140-20=120>>120cm.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it took Chris to mow half of his lawn using both modes (turtle and rabbit). Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate time for half the lawn in turtle mode.
Chris can mow his entire lawn in 40 minutes (turtle mode).

Since he mows half the lawn in turtle mode, we divide the total time by 2.

\[
\text{Time in turtle mode} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate time for half the lawn in rabbit mode.
Again, since he can mow his entire lawn in 40 minutes (rabbit mode), we divide the total time by 2.

\[
\text{Time in rabbit mode} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Sum up the times from both modes.
Now, add the time taken in turtle mode to the time taken in rabbit mode.

\[
\text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it took Chris **40 minutes** to mow the entire lawn today.

The final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take for John and Jack to reach their destination (school) if they continue walking at the same pace.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine Total Time Available:**
   - They have 30 minutes in total.
   
2. **Calculate Time Spent So Far:**
   - It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
   - It then takes them an additional 13 minutes to get to the fire station.
   
3. **Sum Up Time Spent So Far:**
   \[
   6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Subtract Time Spent from Total Time:**
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   - After reaching the fire station, they still have 11 minutes left before reaching their destination (school).

Therefore, the time they have left to reach school without being late is 11 minutes.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Catherine pays in total at the grocery store, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit separately and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Apples:
1. **Number of kilos**: 1 kilo
2. **Price per kilo**: $4
   - Cost = Number of kilos × Price per kilo
   - Cost = 1 kilo × $4/kilo
   - Cost = $4

#### Bananas:
1. **Number of kilos**: 2 kilos
2. **Price per kilo**: $2
   - Cost = Number of kilos × Price per kilo
   - Cost = 2 kilos × $2/kilo
   - Cost = $4

#### Oranges:
1. **Number of kilos**: 2 kilos (since ""2 : kilos"" means 2/3 of a kilo)
2. **Price per kilo**: $3
   - Cost = Number of kilos × Price per kilo
   - Cost = (2/3) kilos × $3/kilo
   - Cost = ($2 + $1)/kilometer × $3/kilogram
   - Cost = $5

#### Total Cost:
1. **Total cost** = Cost of apples + Cost of bananas + Cost of oranges
2. **Total cost** = $4 + $4 + $5
3. **Total cost** = $13

Therefore, the total amount Catherine pays is \( \boxed{13} \) dollars.<|im_end|>","1 kilo of apples costs $<<1*4=4>>4.

Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many cookies Celinda baked.
Greta baked 30 cookies. Celinda baked ""twice as many"" as Greta. Therefore:

\[ \text{Cookies Celinda baked} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies baked.
Now we add the cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda together:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 30 (\text{Greta}) + 60 (\text{Celinda}) = 90 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total.
They ate 10 cookies. So we subtract that from the total number of cookies:

\[ \text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80 \]

### Conclusion
There are **80** cookies remaining in the box after eating some of them. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T_1 \) be the age of the first twin.
   - Let \( T_2 \) be the age of the second twin (which we assume to be the same as \( T_1 \)).
   - Let \( T_3 \) be the age of the first triplet.
   - Let \( T_4 \) be the age of the second triplet.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. This can be written as:
     \[
     T_1 = T_3 + 7
     \]
   - The combined ages of both sets of twins and triplets sum up to 44 years. This gives us:
     \[
     T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4 = 44
     \]

3. **Substitute the Age Difference:**
   - Since \( T_1 = T_3 + 7 \), substitute \( T_1 \) in the equation above:
     \[
     (T_3 + 7) + T_2 + T_3 + T_4 = 44
     \]
   - Simplify this equation:
     \[
     2T_3 + T_2 + T_4 + 7 = 44
     \]
     \[
     2T_3 + T_2 + T_4 = 37
     \]

4. **Solve for the Ages:**
   - Now we have two equations involving \( T_2 \) and \( T_4 \):
     \[
     2T_3 + T_2 + T_4 = 37
     \]
   - To find \( T_2 \), we need more information or another relationship between \( T_2 \) and \( T_4 \). However, since no additional constraints are provided, we cannot uniquely determine \( T_2 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - With only one piece of information about the relationship between twins and triplets, we cannot uniquely determine the ages of the twins without additional data.

Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot conclusively determine the exact ages of the twins. The final answer is that there is insufficient information to determine the ages of the twins.<|im_end|>","Let T = age of triplet

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine total time available for napping:**
   - We know that John has a total of 3 hours left before he needs to eat dinner.
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} = 3 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining time after accounting for all other tasks:**
   - John has 20 minutes of math homework.
   - John has 40 minutes of reading homework.
   - John has 20 minutes of history homework.

   Total time spent on these three types of homework:
   \[
   20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Subtract this from the total available time (180 minutes):
   \[
   180 \text{ minutes} - 80 \text{ minutes} = 100 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Verify if there is enough time left for napping:**
   - After completing his homework, John still has 100 minutes left in his schedule.
   - This matches our earlier calculation, so everything checks out.

Therefore, John has **100 minutes** to nap.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of items purchased.
Manolo bought 5 lollipops + 4 candies = 9 items.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of these items.
Each candy costs $3.20 and he has 4 candies.
Total cost for candies = 4 candies × $3.20/candy = $12.80

Since each lollipop costs $0.40 and he has 5 lollipops,
Total cost for lollipops = 5 lollipops × $0.40/lollipop = $2.00

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on the items.
Total amount spent = Cost of candies + Cost of lollipops
= $12.80 (candies) + $2.00 (lollipops)
= $14.80

### Step 4: Determine the cost per item.
We need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost.

Let's denote the cost of one candy as \(C\) and the cost of one lollipop as \(L\).
From the information given:
\[ C = \$3.20 \]
\[ L = \$0.40 \]

Now we know that:
- Total cost for 10 candies = \(10C = 10 \times \$3.20 = \$32.00\)

For 10 lollipops at $0.40 each:
\[ 10L = 10 \times \$0.40 = \$4.00 \]

### Step 5: Add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies together.
Cost of 10 lollipops + Cost of 10 candies = \$4.00 (lollipops) + \$32.00 (candies)
= \$36.00

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is} \$36.00<|im_end|>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many coins Rong and Neil have saved over ten years based on their monthly savings rates.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Rong's Monthly Savings:**
   - Rong saves $20 per month.
   
2. **Calculate Neil's Monthly Savings:**
   - Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as much as Rong.
   - Calculate \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\):
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
     \]
   - So, Neil saves $8 per month.

3. **Calculate the Number of Months in Ten Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, there are \(12 \times 10 = 120\) months in ten years.

4. **Calculate the Total Savings for Each Person Over Ten Years:**
   - For Rong:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings}_{Rong} = 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For Neil:
     \[
     \text{Total Savings}_{Neil} = 8 \times 120 = 960 \text{ dollars}

                    question:
                    John brings his dog : to the vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, , and a heartworm ! check. ! The heartworm check , is 60% ? of ? his total bill. If he ; brought $125 , with him, . how much ! does he leave with?

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the cost of the vaccines:**
   - Each vaccine costs $20.
   - There are two vaccines needed.
   - Total cost for vaccines = \(2 \times \$20 = \$40\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the heartworm check:**
   - The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   - Let the total bill be \(T\).
   - According to the problem, \(0.60 \times T\) equals the cost of the heartworm check.

3. **Set up an equation to find the total bill \(T\):**
   - We know that John brought $125 in total.
   - Therefore, \(T = \$125\).

4. **Find the cost of the heartworm check using the total bill \(T\):**
   - Cost of heartworm check = \(0.60 \times \$125 = \$75\).

5. **Calculate the total amount spent on all services:**
   - Total amount spent = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check.
   - Total amount spent = \$40 (vaccines) + \$75 (heartworm check) = \$115.

6. **Subtract the total amount spent from the money John brought:**
   - Money left with John = Money brought by John - Total amount spent.
   - Money left with John = \$125 - \$115 = \$10.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} \$10.<|im_end|>","The vaccines cost 40 because 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the crate based on the prices of the different types of fruit it contains. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Each Type of Fruit
- **Bananas**: 
  - Number of bananas = 5
  - Price of one banana = \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the price of an apple (since bananas cost half as much as apples)
  - Therefore, the price of one banana = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \$0.5 \) = \$0.25
  - Total cost of bananas = 5 × \$0.25 = \$1.25

- **Apples**:
  - Number of apples = 12
  - Price of one apple = \$0.5
  - Total cost of apples = 12 × \$0.5 = \$6.00

- **Oranges**:
  - Number of oranges = 7
  - Price of one orange = 3 times the price of a banana
  - Since the price of one banana is \$0.25, then the price of one orange = \( 3 \times \$0.25 \) = \$0.75
  - Total cost of oranges = 7 × \$0.75 = \$5.25

### Step 2: Sum Up the Costs
Now, let's add up the costs of all the fruits to find out how much the entire crate costs.

- Total cost = Cost of bananas + Cost of apples + Cost of oranges
- Total cost = \$1.25 + \$6.00 + \$5.25 = \$12.50

### Final Answer
Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit would be $\boxed{12.50}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter based on the given information about the different colors.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of squares:**
   - We know there are 14 red squares.
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
     \]
   - There are 6 more green squares than blue squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of white squares:**
   - There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
     \]

3. **Sum up all the squares to find the total area:**
   - Each square is \(1 \times 1\) foot².
   - Therefore, the total number of square feet in the comforter is:
     \[
     \text{Total square footage} = 14 (\text{red}) + 18 (\text{blue}) + 24 (\text{green}) + 12 (\text{white})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total square footage} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 70 \text{ square feet}
     \]

So, Brittany's comforter covers an area of **70 square feet**.<|im_end|>","With 4 more blue than red squares, the comforter has 14+4=<<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.

In total, the comforter has 14+18+24+12 = <<14+18+24+12=68>>68 squares that are 1-foot by 1-foot in size.
Since each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, then each square equals one square foot.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To determine how many additional chairs Mia needs for her upcoming event, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people attending the event.
- There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so the total number of people is:
\[ 42 \text{ (adults)} + 15 \text{ (babies)} = 57 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of high chairs needed.
Given that there are 8 high chairs.

### Step 3: Determine the number of regular chairs needed.
Since the restaurant has \(5\) times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of chairs required.
Adding the number of high chairs and regular chairs together:
\[ 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \]

### Step 5: Compare the total number of chairs needed with the current inventory.
- Currently, the restaurant already has 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, totaling:
\[ 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \]

### Conclusion:
Mia's restaurant currently has exactly enough chairs to accommodate all attendees. Therefore, no additional chairs are needed.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{No additional chairs are needed}}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Determine how many of the deer are buck.
2. Determine how many of those buck deer are 8-point.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of buck deer
Given that 50% of the deer are bucks, we can calculate the number of buck deer as follows:
- Total number of deer = 50
- Percentage of deer that are bucks = 50%

Number of bucks = (Total number of deer) × (Percentage of deer that are bucks)
= 50 × 0.50
= 25

So, there are 25 bucks.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of 8-point bucks
We know that 20% of the bucks have 8 points. So, let's find out how many of these bucks are 8-point.

Number of bucks with 8 points = (Number of bucks) × (Percentage of bucks that are 8-point)
= 25 × 0.20
= 5

Therefore, there are 5 bucks that are 8 points.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points the students have collectively and then calculate how many more points they need to reach the trip threshold.

1. **Determine the number of points each student has:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   
2. **Calculate Betty's points based on Adam’s collection:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
     \[

4. **Calculate Marta's points based on Tom's collection:**
   - Marta collected 3 times as much as Tom.
     \[

2. **Children of GGJ**: 
   - There are \(3 \text{ children} \times 3 = 9\) children from GGJ's children.

3. **Grandchildren of GGJ**:
   - These 9 children have three children each.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren (GGs) is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

4. **Great Grand-Babies of GGJ**:
   - Each of these 27 grandchildren has three babies.
   - So, the total number of Great Grand-Babies (GGB) is \(27 \times 3 = 81\).

1. Calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account.
2. Calculate the amount Greta spends on her car payment.
3. Subtract these amounts from her total paycheck to find out how much money she has left.

Let's start with the first calculation:

1. **Amount put into retirement account:**
   - Greta's total paycheck = $2400.00
   - Percentage put into retirement account = 50%
   - Amount in retirement account = Total paycheck * (Percentage / 100)
   
   \[
   \text{Amount in retirement account} = \$2400.00 \times \left(\frac{50}{100}\right) = \$2400.00 \times 0.5 = \$1200.00
   \]

Next, let's calculate the second part:

2. **Amount spent on car payment:**
   - Percentage spent on car payment = 20%
   - Car payment amount = Total paycheck * (Percentage / 100)
   
   \[
   \text{Car payment amount} = \$2400.00 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) = \$2400.00 \times 0.2 = \$480.00
   \]

Finally, let's subtract both amounts from her total paycheck:

3. **Remaining amount after payments:**
   - Remaining amount = Total paycheck - Retirement account amount - Car payment amount
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$2400.00 - \$1200.00 - \$480.00 = \$720.00

Hannah see in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many fireworks Hannah will see, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Hannah’s City Display:**
   - She has 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
   - Total number of fireworks in the city display = \( 15 \times 20 \).

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Fireworks in the City Display:**
   - \( 15 \times 20 = 300 \) fireworks.

3. **Hannah’s Backyard Setup:**
   - She plans to set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.
   - Total number of fireworks in the backyard setup = \( 3 \times 5 \).

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Fireworks in the Backyard Setup:**
   - \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) fireworks.

5. **Determining What Percentage of the City's Fireworks Hannah Will See:**
   - The city displays 40% of its fireworks to the public.
   - Therefore, Hannah can expect to see \( 40\% \) of these fireworks.

6. **Calculating the Number of Fireworks Hannah Will See in the City Display:**
   - Since she sees 40% of the city’s fireworks, we need to calculate \( 40\% \) of the 300 displayed fireworks.
   - \( 40\% \) of 300 = \( 0.40 \times 300 \).
   
7. **Performing the Calculation:**
   - \( 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \).

8. **Adding the Fireworks from the Backyard Setup:**
   - Hannah will also have 15 fireworks in her backyard.
   - Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see = \( 120 + 15 \).

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - \( 120 + 15 = 135 \).

**Conclusion:** Hannah will see a total of **135 fireworks** during the Fourth of July celebration.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of fireworks the city sets off: 15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = <<15*20=300>>300 fireworks
Then multiply that number by the proportion of the fireworks Hannah can see: 300 fireworks * 40% = <<300*40*.01=120>>120 fireworks
Then find the number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her own backyard: 3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = <<3*5=15>>15 fireworks
Then add the number of city fireworks to the number of personal fireworks to find the total number of fireworks: 15 fireworks + 120 fireworks = <<15+120=135>>135 fireworks

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people attending**

- Initially, Aiden has 12 friends.
- Then, he meets up with an additional 7 friends.

Total number of people = Initial friends + Additional friends
= 12 + 7
= 19 people

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of seats needed**

Each seat can hold 3 items (one drink, one snack).

Seats required = Total number of people / Seats per seat
= 19 / 3
≈ 6.33 seats

Since we cannot have a fraction of a seat, we need to round up to ensure everyone has space.

Number of seats needed = ceil(19/3)
= ceil(6.33)

ceil(x) means taking the ceiling value, which rounds up to the nearest integer greater than or equal to x.

So, they will need **7 seats** for all their friends and snacks.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed**

Given that each drink costs $2 and each snack also costs $2,

Cost per drink = $2
Cost per snack = $2

Drinks needed = Number of seats * Drinks per seat
= 7 * 2
= 14 drinks

Snacks needed = Number of seats * Snacks per seat
= 7 * 3
= 21 snacks

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks**

Cost of drinks = Drinks needed * Cost per drink
= 14 * $2
= $28

Cost of snacks = Snacks needed * Cost per snack
= 21 * $2
= $42

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent on drinks and snacks**

Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks
= $28 + $42
= $70

Therefore, the group has spent a total of **$70** on drinks and snacks overall.<|im_end|>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.
In total, the seats can hold 2 drinks * 20 seats = <<2*20=40>>40 drinks.
In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of Gissela's truck
Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds of gravel.

### Step 2: Determine the capacity of Gordy's truck
Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
\[ \text{Capacity of Gordy's truck} = \text{Capacity of Gissela's truck} + 800 \]
\[ \text{Capacity of Gordy's truck} = 4,000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} \]
\[ \text{Capacity of Gordy's truck} = 4,800 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of Gissela, Gordy, and Gary's trucks
We know that together they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 4,000 \text{ pounds (Gissela)} + 4,800 \text{ pounds (Gordy)} + x \text{ pounds (Gary)} \]
where \( x \) represents the amount of gravel Gary's truck can carry.

Given that the total capacity is 11,600 pounds:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[ 4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 8,800 + x = 11,600 \]
Subtract 8,800 from both sides:
\[ x = 11,600 - 8,800 \]
\[ x = 2,800 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Gary’s truck can carry **2,800** pounds of gravel.<|im_end|>","Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.
Thus, Gary's truck can carry 11,600-4000-4800=<<11600-4000-4800=2800>>2800 pounds of gravel.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many dumplings each male ate**

Given that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can start by calculating the number of dumplings eaten by each male.

- Each female ate \(3\) dumplings.
- Therefore, each male ate \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by all females**

There are \(6\) females, and each female ate \(3\) dumplings.

\[ \text{Total dumplings from females} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of dumplings consumed by all males**

There are \(8\) males, and each male ate \(4\) dumplings.

\[ \text{Total dumplings from males} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

**Step 4: Sum up the total number of dumplings eaten by everyone**

Now, add the total dumplings from females and males together to get the overall total.

\[ \text{Total dumplings} = 18 (females) + 32 (males) = 50 \]

So, **Larry cooked 50 dumplings**.<|im_end|>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.
Hence, the 8 males ate a total of 8 x 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 dumplings.
The 6 females ate a total of 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 dumplings.
So, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is 18 + 32 = <<18+32=50>>50.

                    question:
                    Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. If ? Gerald spent . $10 on a book, how much money did he have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the total parts of the ratio.
2. Calculate the value of each part of the ratio.
3. Find out how much Gerald had initially after spending.
4. Subtract the amount spent from his initial amount.

**Step 1: Determine the total parts of the ratio**

The ratio given is 3:2. This means there are 3 + 2 = 5 parts in total.

**Step 2: Calculate the value of each part of the ratio**

Since the total sum is $100, we divide it by the total number of parts (5) to find the value of one part.

\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = \$20
\]

**Step 3: Find out how much Gerald had initially after spending**

Gerald's share of the $100 is based on the ratio. Since the ratio is 3:2, for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts.

\[
\text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = \$60
\]

However, Gerald already spent $10 on a book. So, let's calculate his remaining balance after spending.

\[
\text{Remaining balance for Gerald} = 60 - 10 = \$50
\]

So, the final answer is that Gerald has $50 left after spending on the book.<|im_end|>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.
So each part is $100/5 = $<<100/5=20>>20.

Gerald bought a book at $<<10=10>>10.
Therefore, Gerald was left with $60 - $10 = $<<60-10=50>>50.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the turtle
First, let's find out how fast the turtle can move. We know that the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet per second.

Since the cat is 5 times as fast as the turtle, we can calculate the turtle's speed using the formula for speed (distance over time).

Let \( v_turtle \) be the speed of the turtle.
Given that the cat's speed \( v_cat = 15 \text{ feet/second} \), and the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle:
\[ v_cat = 5 \times v_turtle \]

Solving for \( v_turtle \):
\[ v_turtle = \frac{v_cat}{5} \]
\[ v_turtle = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} \]
\[ v_turtle = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

So, the turtle moves at a speed of 3 feet per second.

### Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle travels in 40 seconds
Now that we know the turtle's speed, we can determine how far it will travel in 40 seconds.

Distance traveled by the turtle \( d_turtle \) is given by:
\[ d_turtle = v_turtle \times t \]
where \( t \) is the time in seconds.

Substituting the values:
\[ d_turtle = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} \]
\[ d_turtle = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle will crawl **120 feet** in 40 seconds.<|im_end|>","First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the remaining amount needed:**
   - Total goal = $6300
   - Amount already raised after 3 hours = $2100
   - Remaining amount = $6300 - $2100 = $4200

2. **Calculate the number of hours left until reaching the goal:**
   - Since the firefighters need to raise an equal amount in each hour to meet their goal,
   - We can find out how many hours are still required by dividing the remaining amount by the hourly contribution.
   
3. **Find the hourly contribution from the first 3 hours:**
   - Amount raised in the first 3 hours = $2100
   
4. **Determine the average (equal) hourly contribution:**
   - Average hourly contribution = Amount raised in 3 hours / Number of hours = $2100 / 3 = $700 per hour

5. **Calculate the number of hours left for fundraising:**
   - Number of hours left = Remaining amount / Hourly contribution = $4200 / $700 = 6 hours

### Step 5: Add the amounts of both types of ice cream to find the total production over 48 hours.
- Total amount of chocolate ice cream produced in 48 hours: 2400 quarts.
- Total amount of vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours: 600 quarts.
- Total production in 48 hours: \( 2400 + 600 = 3000 \) quarts.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{3000}
\] quarts of ice cream would be made in 48 hours.<|im_end|>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Marcus's order before applying the discount. Then, we'll apply the 10% discount to find the final amount he needs to pay.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the croissants.
Marcus orders 5 croissants at $3.00 each.
\[ \text{Cost of croissants} = 5 \times \$3.00 = \$15.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cinnamon rolls.
Marcus orders 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each.
\[ \text{Cost of cinnamon rolls} = 4 \times \$2.50 = \$10.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mini quiches.
Marcus orders 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each.
\[ \text{Cost of mini quiches} = 3 \times \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the blueberry muffins.
Marcus orders 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each.
\[ \text{Cost of blueberry muffins} = 13 \times \$1.00 = \$13.00 \]

Step 5: Sum up all the costs to get the total purchase amount.
\[ \text{Total purchase amount} = \$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00 \]

Step 6: Apply the 10% discount on the total purchase amount.
\[ \text{Discounted total} = \$50.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$50.00 \times 0.90 = \$45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill after applying the 10% discount is $\boxed{\$45.00}$.<|im_end|>","5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00

                    question:
                    The ice cream parlor was ? offering a deal, buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free.  Each scoop cost $1.50.  If Erin had  $6.00, ; how many scoops of ice cream should : she buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy, let's follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total cost for one scoop**
Each scoop costs $1.50.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for two scoops**
Since there is a deal where you get one scoop free when you buy another, we only pay for one scoop at full price.
Cost for two scoops = $1.50 (one scoop) + $1.50 (another scoop)

So, the total cost for two scoops is:
$1.50 (first scoop) + $1.50 (second scoop) = $3.00

**Step 3: Determine how much money Erin has to spend on the deal**
Erin has $6.00.

**Step 4: Calculate how many deals Erin can afford with her money**
We divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost per deal (which is $3.00).

Number of deals Erin can afford = Total money / Cost per deal
= $6.00 / $3.00

This gives us:
Number of deals Erin can afford = 2

**Step 5: Calculate the number of scoops Erin can purchase**
Since each deal includes two scoops, we multiply the number of deals by two to find out how many scoops in total she can have.

Total scoops Erin can have = Number of deals × Scoops per deal
= 2 deals × 2 scoops/deal

Therefore, Erin can afford to buy **4 scoops** of ice cream with her $6.00.

**Final Answer:** Erin should buy **4 scoops** of ice cream.<|im_end|>","Each scoop cost $1.50. If she buys 2, she gets one free. So it will cost her 2 * 1.50 = $<<2*1.50=3.00>>3.00 for thee scoops total.
If you break it down, 3 scoops of ice cream cost $3.00 so 3/3 = $<<3/3=1.00>>1.00 per scoop
Erin has $6.00 and each scoop ends up costing $1.00 each then 6/1 = <<6/1=6>>6 scoops total

To determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.
\[ \text{Number of days} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many pieces of candy each person eats per day.
- **Ginger**: 4 pieces/day
- **Amy**: 3 pieces/day

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of candies each person eats over two weeks (14 days).
For Ginger:
\[ \text{Total candies eaten by Ginger} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

For Amy:
\[ \text{Total candies eaten by Amy} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount of candy each person eats from their initial quantity.
- **Initial candy for Ginger** = 100 pieces
- **Candy remaining for Ginger** = \( 100 - 56 \)
- **Initial candy for Amy** = 100 pieces
- **Candy remaining for Amy** = \( 100 - 42 \)

### Step 5: Perform the subtraction.
- **Remaining candy for Ginger** = \( 100 - 56 = 44 \) pieces
- **Remaining candy for Amy** = \( 100 - 42 = 58 \) pieces

### Step 6: Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger.
\[ \text{Difference} = 58 - 44 = 14 \]

### Conclusion:
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area that needs to be covered:**
   - Mr. Boarden wants to cover two-thirds of his bathroom.
   - The total area of the bathroom is given as 36 square feet.

   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ square feet}
   \]

   Let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how many tiles are needed for one square foot:**
   - According to the problem, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles per square foot.

3. **Calculate the total number of tiles required:**
   - We already know the area that needs to be covered (24 square feet).

   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost James would pay if he bought blueberries from the store.
- The price per pound in stores is $2.5.
- James picked 30 pounds.

\[
\text{Total cost from store} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost from store} = \$2.5 \times 30 = \$75
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost James actually paid for picking blueberries.
- The initial cost to go picking was $20.
- There is an additional charge of $1.5 per pound.

First, calculate the cost based on the number of pounds picked:

\[
\text{Cost per pound} = \$1.5
\]
\[
\text{Total cost per pound} = \$1.5
\]

Next, add the initial cost:

\[
\text{Total cost from picking} = \text{Initial cost} + (\text{Pounds} \times \text{Cost per pound})
\]

\[
\text{Total cost from picking} = \$20 + (30 \times \$1.5)
\]

Calculate the multiplication first:

\[
30 \times \$1.5 = \$45
\]

Now, add the initial cost:

\[
\$20 + \$45 = \$65
\]

### Step 3: Determine how much James saved compared to buying from the store.

Subtract the total cost from picking from the total cost if he had bought from the store:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost from store} - \text{Total cost from picking}
\]

\[
\text{Savings} = \$75 - \$65 = \$10
\]

### Conclusion
James saved $10 compared to buying blueberries from the store.

The final answer is: The final answer is $\boxed{\$10}$<|im_end|>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original cost per computer
Let's assume the original price per computer was \( P \).

Given that the actual price was 10% higher than expected:
\[ \text{Actual Price} = P + 0.1P = 1.1P \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total budget available
The company originally intended to spend $700 on each computer.

Total budget = Number of Computers × Original Price Per Computer
\[ \text{Total Budget} = 500 \times P \]

However, since the company only has $700 per computer initially:
\[ \text{Total Budget} = 500 \times \$700 \]

### Step 3: Find out how many computers can be bought with the initial budget
\[ \text{Number of Computers} = \frac{\$700}{\text{Original Price per Computer}} \]
Since the total budget from the company’s perspective is limited to $700 per computer, let's calculate:
\[ \text{Initial Budget} = 500 \times \$700 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the new price per computer after the increase
\[ \text{New Price per Computer} = 1.1P \]

### Step 5: Determine the number of computers that can be bought within the budget limit
Since the total budget is already used up in purchasing 500 computers at $700 each:
\[ \text{Number of Comps} = 500 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost considering the increased price per computer
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Comps} \times \text{New Price per Comp} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 500 \times 1.1P \]

### Step 7: Simplify the expression
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 500 \times 1.1 \times P \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is \( 500 \times 1.1 \times P \). Since the exact value of \( P \) (the original price per computer) isn't provided, the answer remains in terms of \( P \).

To find out how many calories are in John's omelet, we need to consider the calorie content from each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the Calories from Eggs
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Calories from Cheese
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- The cheese contains 120 calories per ounce.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Calories from Ham
- John uses an equal amount of ham as he does of cheese (since there is no information on the specific quantity or calorie content), so we assume he uses 2 ounces of ham for simplicity (as it’s not specified otherwise).
- The ham contains 40 calories per ounce.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum Up All Calorific Components
Now, add up all the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham:

\[
\text{Total calories in the omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 830 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total number of calories in the omelet is \boxed{830}.<|im_end|>","The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories

- The cost of one pencil is $0.50.
- You bought 6 pencils.

\[
\text{Total cost of pencils} = 6 \times 0.50 = \$3.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the erasers.
- The cost of one eraser is $0.25.
- You bought 8 erasers.

\[
\text{Total cost of erasers} = 8 \times 0.25 = \$2.00
\]

### Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$5.00
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the total amount spent from the total payment made.
\[

                    question:
                    ? Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice and gave 3 sacks to her cousin ; and . 4 sacks ! to her brother, if , there are , 25 . kilograms of rice per . sack, : how , many kilograms ; does she gave ? to her , cousin and ? brother?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of sacks Goldy had initially:**
   Goldy started with 20 sacks.

2. **Calculate the total weight of rice in these sacks:**
   Since there are 25 kg of rice per sack, we can find the total weight by multiplying the number of sacks by the weight per sack.
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 20 \times 25 \text{ kg/sack}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 500 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Subtract the sacks given away:**
   Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, so we need to subtract these from the initial amount.
   
   \[
   \text{Sacks remaining after giving away} = (20 - 3) + (20 - 4)
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Sacks remaining after giving away} = 17
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of rice left:**
   Now that we know how many sacks are left, we can calculate the total weight of the remaining rice.
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of remaining rice} = 17 \times 25 \text{ kg/sack}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of remaining rice} = 425 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Find out how much rice was actually distributed:**
   The difference between the total weight of rice at the beginning and the weight of the remaining rice will give us the total amount of rice distributed.
   
   \[
   \text{Rice distributed} = 500 \text{ kg} - 425 \text{ kg}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Rice distributed} = 75 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Summarize the distribution:**
   Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother, which totals 7 sacks, but only 75 kg of rice was distributed.

So, Goldy gave 75 kg of rice to both her cousin and her brother. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75 \text{ kg}}
\]<|im_end|>","Goldy gave a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 sacks of rice to his brother and cousin.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. Calculate the total number of taps Helga makes when raising her arms.
2. Calculate the total number of taps Helga makes without raising her arms.
3. Sum these two values to get the total number of taps.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of taps when raising her arms

When raising her arms, her tap rates for both feet are reduced from their respective maximums. We can calculate this as follows:

- Right foot tap rate = 200 taps/minute
- Left foot tap rate = 200 taps/minute

Since she raises her arms for 2 out of every 5 minutes, we need to find the portion of time she uses her reduced tap rates:

\[ \text{Time using reduced tap rates} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, calculate the total number of taps:

- Total taps when raising arms:
\[ (200 \text{ taps/min}) \times 2 \text{ min} + (200 \text{ taps/min}) \times 2 \text{ min} = 400 \text{ taps} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of taps when not raising her arms

When not raising her arms, her tap rates are her maximum rates:

- Right foot tap rate = 300 taps/minute
- Left foot tap rate = 300 taps/minute

So, the total number of taps in the remaining part of the dance is:

- Total taps when not raising arms:
\[ (300 \text{ taps/min}) \times 3 \text{ min} = 900 \text{ taps} \]

### Step 3: Combine the results

Now, add the taps from both scenarios to get the total number of taps:

\[ 400 \text{ taps} + 900 \text{ taps} = 1300 \text{ taps} \]

Therefore, the combined total number of times Helga taps both her feet is \( 1300 \).

Ending Answer: The final answer is: 1300.<|im_end|>","During the 5 minutes of dancing, 2 minutes were performed with hands raised and 5-2=3 minutes were performed without hands raised.
With hands not raised, her right foot tapped 3*300=<<3*300=900>>900 times.
With hands not raised, her left foot tapped 3*250=<<3*250=750>>750 times.
With hands raised, her right foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
With hands raised, her left foot tapped 2*200=<<2*200=400>>400 times.
Thus, in total, she tapped 900+750+400+400=<<900+750+400+400=2450>>2450 times

To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost if the pothole remains unfixed.
- The estimated damage from not fixing the pothole is $450.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if Ron decides to fix the pothole himself.
- Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 per bucket = \( 3 \times 25 = \$75 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost if Ron buys an additional bag of gravel.
- Cost of one bag of gravel = $60.
  
### Step 4: Sum up all costs involved in either option (fixing or buying).
- Total cost if the pothole remains unfixed = $450.
- Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself = $75 + $60 = $135.

### Step 5: Determine the difference between the two options.
- Savings = Total cost if the pothole remains unfixed - Total cost if Ron fixes the pothole himself.
\[ Savings = 450 - 135 = \$315 \]

### Final Answer:
Ron saves **$315** by fixing the pothole himself rather than hiring someone else to fix it.<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of normal chairs left after sending some to the carpenter.
- Total normal chairs: 170
- Number of normal chairs sent to the carpenter: \( \frac{20}{100} \times 170 = 34 \)

Now, calculate the remaining normal chairs:
\[ 170 - 34 = 136 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of baby chairs left after sending some to the carpenter.
- Total baby chairs: 23
- Number of baby chairs sent to the carpenter: \( \frac{13}{23} \) (since only one-third of the baby chairs are sent)
\[ \frac{13}{23} \times 23 = 13 \]

Now, calculate the remaining baby chairs:
\[ 23 - 13 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs left in the restaurant.
- Remaining normal chairs: 136
- Remaining baby chairs: 10

Finally, add these together to get the total number of chairs left:
\[ 136 + 10 = 146 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza were left after everyone has eaten. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices in one pizza.
Each pizza has \(12\) slices.

### Step 2: Determine the number of pizzas each person ordered.
Bryce and two of his friends each ordered one pizza. Therefore, there are \(4\) pizzas in total.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of pizza each group ate.
- **First Group (Bryce and two friends):**
  - They eat \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas.
  - Since they have \(4\) pizzas in total, they eat \(\frac{2}{3} \times 4 = \frac{8}{3}\) pizzas.
  
- **Second Group (the two remaining friends):**
  - They eat \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas.
  - Since they also have \(4\) pizzas in total, they eat \(\frac{3}{4} \times 4 = 3\) pizzas.

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of pizza consumed.
- First Group: \(\frac{8}{3}\)
- Second Group: \(3\)

Total consumed = \(\frac{8}{3} + 3\).

### Step 5: Convert the fractions into a common denominator for easier calculation.
Convert \(3\) to a fraction with denominator \(3\):
\[ 3 = \frac{9}{3} \]

So,
\[ \text{Total consumed} = \frac{8}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \]

### Step 6: Subtract the total consumed from the total available.
There were originally \(4\) pizzas, which means \(4 \times 12 = 48\) slices in total.

Remaining slices = Total slices - Consumed slices
= \(48 - \frac{17}{3}\)

### Step 7: Simplify the expression.
\[ 48 - \frac{17}{3} = \frac{144}{3} - \frac{17}{3} = \frac{127}{3} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the number of slices of pizza that were left is \(\boxed{\frac{127}{3}}\).<|im_end|>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it would take for both the cat and the dog to eat the same number of sausages.

1. **Determine the rate at which the cat eats sausages:**
   - The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
   - Therefore, the cat's eating rate is \( \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10} \) sausages per minute.

2. **Calculate the time it takes for the cat to eat the same number of sausages as the dog:**
   - Let \( T_c \) be the time (in minutes) it takes for the cat to eat 9 sausages.
   - Given that the cat eats \( \frac{3}{10} \) sausages per minute, we have:
     \[
     T_c = \frac{9}{\frac{3}{10}} = 9 \times \frac{10}{3} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the dog’s eating rate based on the information given:**
   - The dog eats the same number of sausages in less than half the time the cat takes.
   - Since the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog will take \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) minutes.

4. **Verify if the dog’s rate matches the cat’s rate:**
   - If the dog eats 9 sausages in 15 minutes, its rate is \( \frac{9}{15} = \frac{3}{5} \) sausages per minute.
   - This is not equal to the cat’s rate of \( \frac{3}{10} \) sausages per minute.

Since the dog does not match the cat’s rate, let's correct our approach:

5. **Re-evaluate the dog's time considering the ratio provided:**
   - The dog should eat the same number of sausages in \( \frac{3}{2} \) times the time the cat takes.
   - Therefore, the dog's time \( T_d \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \times T_c \).

6. **Substitute the value of \( T_c \):**
   - \( T_d = \frac{3}{2} \times 30 = 45 \text{ minutes} \).

7. **Calculate the total time taken by both animals:**
   - Total time = Time taken by cat + Time taken by dog = \( 30 + 45 = 75 \text{ minutes} \).

8. **Find the average time taken by both:**
   - Average time = \( \frac{Total \; time}{Number \; of \; animals} = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5 \text{ minutes} \).

Therefore, the average time taken by both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 37.5 minutes. {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Use the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoes' lengths to find Bobby's shoe length.

Let's start with Step 1:

### Step 1: Convert Topher's shoe length to inches
Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the feet into inches first and then add them to the remaining inches.

- 8 feet = \( 8 \times 12 \) inches
- Add the 4 additional inches.

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \frac{\text{inches}}{\text{foot}} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoes' lengths
We know that Topher's shoe length (100 inches) is 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe plus an extra 10 inches.

Let \( B \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, Topher's shoe length is 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe plus 10 inches:

\[ 100 = 9B + 10 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):

\[ 100 - 10 = 9B \]
\[ 90 = 9B \]
\[ B = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ B = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches**.<|im_end|>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

   - There are 64 student cars, and each has 4 windows.
     \[
     \text{Total student car windows} = 64 \times 4 = 256
     \]
   - There are 32 teacher cars, and each has 2 windows.
     \[
     \text{Total teacher car windows} = 32 \times 2 = 64
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of car windows:**
   \[
   \text{Total car windows} = 256 + 64 = 320
   \]

3. **Determine how many of these windows Hannah smashes:**
   - Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the student car windows.
     \[
     \text{Student car windows smashed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64
     \]
   - Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teacher car windows.
     \[
     \text{Teacher car windows smashed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48
     \]

4. **Add the smashed windows together:**
   \[
   \text{Total smashed windows} = 64 (\text{student}) + 48 (\text{teacher}) = 112
   \]

Therefore, Hannah smashes a total of \(112\) windows.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 112.<|im_end|>","First find how many student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars
Then find how many teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars
Then find how many windows the students' cars had smashed: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows
Then find how many windows the teachers' cars had smashed: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows
Then add the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows

To find out what percentage of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of spools.**
- Light blue threads: 15 spools
- Dark blue threads: 45 spools
- Dark green threads: 50 spools

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 50 (dark green)
= 15 + 45 + 50

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of votes cast by midday.
- By midday (which we'll assume is after 8:00), \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
- Total people initially = 5000
- Votes cast by midday = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people left after midday.
- People left after midday = Total people - Votes cast by midday
- People left after midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

### Step 3: Determine the number of votes cast by 16:00.
- By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted.
- Remaining people after midday = 3000
- Votes cast by 16:00 = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people who did not vote by 16:00.
- Total people initially = 5000
- Votes cast by 16:00 = 2000
- Votes not cast by 16:00 = Total people - Votes cast by 16:00
- Votes not cast by 16:00 = 5000 - 2000 = 3000

Therefore, the number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is **3000**.<|im_end|>","If the number of people who turned up to vote was 5000, by midday 2/5*5000 = <<2/5*5000=2000>>2000 had voted.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many packs of gum Parker needs for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total number of pieces of gum Parker consumes in 30 days:**
   - Parker eats 4 pieces of gum per day.
   - Therefore, over 30 days, he will consume \( 4 \times 30 = 120 \) pieces of gum.

2. **Determine the number of packs needed based on the number of pieces per pack:**
   - Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum.
   - To find out how many packs are required, divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack: 
     \[
     \frac{120}{15} = 8
     \]

Thus, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 8 packs.<|im_end|>","He chews 4 pieces of gum a day so over 30 days he will chew 4*30 = <<4*30=120>>120 pieces of gum

Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate total number of Smores needed.
First, we determine the total number of Smores required:

- Each kid wants 2 Smores.
- There are 9 kids.
\[ \text{Total Smores per kid} = 2 \]

- Total Smores for all kids:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

- Each adult also eats one Smore.
- There are 6 adults.
\[ \text{Total Smores for adults} = 6 \]

- Adding these together gives the total number of Smores needed:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many Smores can be made from one box of Graham Crackers.
Each sleeve of Graham Crackers makes enough Smores to cover 8 large Smores.

- Number of sleeves in a box: \(3\)

- Number of Smores that can be made from one box:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes needed.
We know that they need 24 Smores in total. Since each box provides 24 Smores, they only need **one** box to satisfy their needs.

Therefore, the number of boxes needed is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]<|im_end|>","Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores

There are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores
Together the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine Dora's Father's Age**

Given that Dora is 15 years old.

- Twice Dora's age = 2 × 15 = 30
- Dora's father is eight more than twice Dora's age.
  
Therefore, Dora's father's age = 30 + 8 = 38 years.

**Step 2: Calculate Dora's Mother's Age**

Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

Therefore, Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years.

**Step 3: Calculate the Total Combined Age**

Now we have all three ages (Dora, her father, and her mother).

Total combined age = Dora's age + Father's age + Mother's age

= 15 + 38 + 34

= 87 years.

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is **87 years**.<|im_end|>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.
This means Dora's father is 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

   - Cindy's math book weighs 2 pounds.
   - Cindy's science book also weighs 2 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight of these two books:**
   - Math book + Science book = 2 pounds + 2 pounds = 4 pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of the French book:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of votes each candidate received initially.
- **Candidate A** received 20% of the total votes.
- Total votes = 100.

First, calculate the number of votes for Candidate A:
\[ \text{Votes for A} = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of votes that Candidate B received.
- Candidate B received 50% more than Candidate A.
  
Since Candidate A received 20 votes, let’s find out how much more 50% of those 20 votes would be:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, Candidate B received:
\[ \text{Votes for B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the votes from Candidates A and B from the total to determine what remains for Candidate C.
Total votes - Votes for A - Votes for B gives us the votes for Candidate C:
\[ \text{Votes for C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for A} + \text{Votes for B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for C} = 100 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Votes for C} = 100 - 50 \]
\[ \text{Votes for C} = 50 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the number of votes that Candidate C received is \( \boxed{50} \).<|im_end|>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.

Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
\[ \text{Number of apples Beck has} = 100 - 23 \]
\[ \text{Number of apples Beck has} = 77 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many apples Boris will give to Beck.
Boris gives Beck 10 more apples.
\[ \text{Apples after giving away} = 100 - 10 \]
\[ \text{Apples after giving away} = 90 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many fewer apples Beck has compared to Boris after receiving some from him.
After receiving 10 apples from Boris, Beck still has 77 apples. We need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.
\[ \text{Difference in number of apples} = 100 - 90 \]
\[ \text{Difference in number of apples} = 10 \]

So, Beck has 10 fewer apples than Boris.

- Total water used = Water for giant cubes + Water for medium-sized cubes + Water for small cubes

\[ \text{Total water used} = 12 \text{ (giant)} + 14 \text{ (medium)} + 4 \text{ (small)} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

### Step 5: Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water.
- Initial amount of water = 32 ounces.

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 2 ounces}}
\]<|im_end|>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the number of books each person has:**
   - We know that Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - We also know that Clara has twice as many books as Steven.

2. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - Since Clara has 20 books, we can write: \( 2S = 20 \).
   - Solving for \( S \), we get: \( S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \). So, Steven has 10 books.

3. **Calculate the number of books Alice has:**
   - Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven, we can write: \( A = S + 6 \).
   - Substituting \( S = 10 \), we get: \( A = 10 + 6 = 16 \). So, Alice has 16 books.

4. **Find out how many more books Clara has compared to Alice:**
   - We already know Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books.
   - The difference in the number of books between Clara and Alice is: \( C - A \).

5. **Substitute the known values:**
   - Substitute \( C = 20 \) and \( A = 16 \): \( 20 - 16 = 4 \).

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of a half-gallon jar first, then use it to find the cost for both the 10-gallon jars and the 16 half-gallon jars.

### Step 1: Determine the price of a half-gallon jar
We know that a gallon jar costs $5.

Let's denote the price of one half-gallon jar as \( P \).

Given:
- A gallon jar costs $5 (which is equivalent to two half-gallons).
  
Therefore,
\[ 5 = 2P \]
Solving for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $2.5.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on 10-gallon jars
Since a gallon jar costs $5 and a half-gallon jar costs $2.5, a ten-gallon jar would be twice the size of a half-gallon jar.

Thus, the cost per gallon in terms of half-gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost per gallon in half-gallons} = 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \]

Now, if Cecelia buys 10 gallons of milk at the rate of $10 per gallon, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 \times \$10 = \$100 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on 16 half-gallon jars
Similarly, since a half-gallon jar costs $2.5, buying 16 half-galons will also be equivalent to buying 8 full gallons (since there are 4 half-galons in a gallon).

Therefore, the cost per half-gallon in terms of gallons is:
\[ \text{Cost per half-gallon in gallons} = \frac{\$2.5}{\frac{1}{4}} = \$2.5 \times 4 = \$10 \]

If Cecelia buys 16 half-galons at the rate of $10 per gallon, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 16 \times \$10 = \$160 \]

### Final Answer
Cecelia spent a total of **\$100** on 10-gallon jars and **\$160** on 16 half-gallon jars. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{The final answer is}
\]<|im_end|>","If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3

For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48

Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the total number of students.
The total number of students in the class is given as 50.

### Step 2: Determine the number of students who like to play video games.
We know that 5 students like to play basketball. According to the problem, the number of students who like to play video games is twice the number who like to play basketball. Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students who do not like to play video games.
Since we have determined that 10 students like to play video games, we can find out how many do not like to play video games by subtracting from the total number of students:
\[ \text{Number of students who do not like to play video games} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

### Step 4: Summarize the known information.
- Total students (A): 50
- Students who like baking (B): 10
- Students who like basketball (C): 5
- Students who like video games (D) = 10

### Step 5: Set up an equation based on the given condition.
The problem states that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Let \(M\) represent the number of students who like to play music. We are told that:
\[ M = 2 \times C \]
where \(C\) is the number of students who like basketball (which we already know is 5).

### Step 6: Solve for \(M\).
Substitute the value of \(C\) into the equation:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 students who like to play music.

### Conclusion:
The number of students who like to play video games is **10**.<|im_end|>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial count**: Jeremy initially sees 12 birds in his backyard.
   
   \[
   \text{Initial number of birds} = 12
   \]

2. **Birds scared away by the stone**:
   - Jeremy throws a stone at the birds, scaring away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the birds.
   - To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12.

   \[
   \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]

3. **Remaining birds after being scared away**:
   - Subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Additional birds joining**:
   - After being scared away, Jeremy notices 20 more birds join him.
   - Add these to the remaining birds.

   \[
   \text{Total birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of classes
We know that there are two classes in total, and their combined total student count is 80.

\[ \text{Total number of students} = 80 \]

Since these represent two classes:

\[ \text{Number of classes} = 2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the average number of students per class
To find out how many students are in each class, we divide the total number of students by the number of classes.

\[ \text{Students per class} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of classes}} \]
\[ \text{Students per class} = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ \text{Students per class} = 40 \]

So, each class has 40 students.

### Step 3: Determine the percentage of girls in each class
It is given that each class has 40% of its students as girls.

\[ \text{Percentage of girls per class} = 40\% \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of boys in each class
First, let’s determine the total number of students (boys + girls) in one class.

Given that 40% of the students are girls, then 60% must be boys because:

\[ \text{Percentage of boys} = 100\% - 40\% = 60\% \]

Now, to find the number of boys in one class, we multiply the number of students per class by the percentage of boys.

\[ \text{Number of boys per class} = \text{Students per class} \times \text{Percentage of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of boys per class} = 40 \times 60\% \]
\[ \text{Number of boys per class} = 40 \times 0.6 \]
\[ \text{Number of boys per class} = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is **24**.<|im_end|>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.
The girls in each class make up to 40%, so there are 40/100 * 40 = <<40/100*40=16>>16 girls in each of them.
That means the rest of the class are boys, so there are 40 - 16 = <<40-16=24>>24 boys in each class.

To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day during her workweek, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Animals
- **Dogs**: 8
- **Cats**: 5
- **Birds**: 3
- **Horses**: 12

Total number of animals = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)

To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first one, we need to calculate the total costs for both parks based on the number of adults and children in their family.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.
- **Number of adults**: 2
- **Cost per adult at the first park**: $26
- **Number of children**: 2
- **Cost per child at the first park**: $12

First, calculate the total cost for adults at the first park:
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = 2 \times \$26 = \$52 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for children at the first park:
\[ \text{Total cost for children} = 2 \times \$12 = \$24 \]

Finally, add these together to get the total cost for the first amusement park:
\[ \text{Total cost for the first amusement park} = \$52 + \$24 = \$76 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.
- **Number of adults**: 2
- **Cost per adult at the second park**: $14
- **Number of children**: 2
- **Cost per child at the second park**: $10

First, calculate the total cost for adults at the second park:
\[ \text{Total cost for adults} = 2 \times \$14 = \$28 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for children at the second park:
\[ \text{Total cost for children} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Finally, add these together to get the total cost for the second amusement park:
\[ \text{Total cost for the second amusement park} = \$28 + \$20 = \$48 \]

### Step 3: Determine the savings.
Now that we have the total costs for both parks, we can find out how much saving they will achieve by choosing the second amusement park:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost for the first park} - \text{Total cost for the second park} \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$76 - \$48 = \$28 \]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $\boxed{\$28}$ by choosing the second amusement park over the first one.<|im_end|>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.

So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.
Thus, they will save $76 - $48 = $<<76-48=28>>28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of tomatoes bought per day:**
   The vendor buys 500 tomatoes every day.

2. **Calculate the daily cost before switching vendors:**
   Before switching, the price per tomato was $0.5.
   So, the total daily cost = Number of tomatoes × Price per tomato
   = 500 × $0.5
   = $250

3. **Calculate the daily cost after switching vendors:**
   After switching, the price per tomato is now $0.4.
   So, the total daily cost = Number of tomatoes × New price per tomato
   = 500 × $0.4
   = $200

4. **Calculate the savings per day:**
   Savings per day = Original daily cost - New daily cost
   = $250 - $200
   = $50

5. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily savings by 7.
   Weekly savings = Daily savings × Days in a week
   = $50 × 7
   = $350

6. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the amount saved per week is $\boxed{350}$.<|im_end|>","He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many marbles Sean has:**
   - We know that Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Calculate how many marbles Carl has based on Sean’s amount:**
   - Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times (\text{Sean's marbles}) = 4 \times 56 = 224
     \]

3. **Verify the number of marbles Carl has using Sean's marbles:**
   - To confirm, we can check if Carl's count matches the given relationship.
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
     \]
   - This confirms our calculation for Carl.

4. **Determine how many marbles Cal has:**
   - The problem states that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean.
     \[
     \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times (\text{Sean's marbles}) = 2 \times 56 = 112
     \]

5. **Sum up the total number of marbles:**
   - Now, we add up all the marbles to find out how many they have in total.
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = (\text{Carl's marbles}) + (\text{Sean's marbles}) + (\text{Cal's marbles})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 56 + 112 = 492

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional groups are required if we want to have a total of 12 groups instead of just 6.

Step 1: Determine the number of students per group when there are 6 groups.
- There are 54 students in total.
- We need to divide these students equally among 6 groups.
- So, the number of students per group = Total number of students / Number of groups.
- Therefore, the number of students per group = 54 / 6 = 9 students per group.

Step 2: Calculate how many groups would be needed if only 6 groups were formed.
- Since there are 54 students and each group has 9 students, the total number of groups that can be formed = Total number of students / Number of students per group.
- Hence, the total number of groups that can be formed = 54 / 9 = 6 groups.

Step 3: Determine how many more groups are needed to reach the desired total of 12 groups.
- The desired total number of groups is 12.
- Currently, we can only form 6 groups.
- Therefore, the number of additional groups needed = Desired total number of groups - Current number of groups.
- Hence, the number of additional groups needed = 12 - 6 = 6 groups.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 6 additional groups are needed to form a total of 12 groups.<|im_end|>","There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of chairs rented per week on weekdays.
- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday)**: 
  - Number of days = 5
  - Chairs rented per weekday = 60
  - Total chairs rented per week on weekdays = \( 5 \times 60 \)

\[
\text{Total chairs rented per week on weekdays} = 300
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs rented per week on weekends.
- **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday)**:
  - Number of days = 2
  - Chairs rented per weekend day = 100
  - Total chairs rented per week on weekends = \( 2 \times 100 \)

\[
\text{Total chairs rented per week on weekends} = 200
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of weeks in two four-week months.
- Two four-week months = \( 2 \times 4 \) weeks

\[
\text{Total number of weeks} = 8
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of chairs rented over these eight weeks.
- **Weekdays**: \( 8 \times 300 \)
- **Weekends**: \( 8 \times 200 \)

\[
\text{Total chairs rented over eight weeks} = (8 \times 300) + (8 \times 200)
\]

\[
= 2400 + 1600
\]

\[
= 4000
\]

### Conclusion:
Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs over two four-week months.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 4000 chairs.<|im_end|>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

<|im_start|>sys
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas**: Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half**: Arnold takes away half of the bananas.
   - Number of bananas left: \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \).

3. **Gunther adds more bananas**:
   - Gunther adds 25 bananas.
   - New total: \( 24 + 25 = 49 \).

4. **Arnold steals again**: Arnold takes 12 bananas.
   - Number of bananas left: \( 49 - 12 = 37 \).

5. **Gunther adds more bananas**:
   - Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   - Final total: \( 37 + 6 = 43 \).

So, after all these events, Gunther has found 43 bananas in the pile.<|im_end|>","Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
Arnold's first act of thievery removes 24 bananas, leaving 48-24=24 bananas.
Starting with the remaining 24 bananas, adding 25 bananas to the pile brings the total to 24+25=<<24+25=49>>49 bananas.
Arnold's second act of thievery resulted in 49-12=<<49-12=37>>37 bananas remaining.
Gunther adds another 6 bananas, resulting in the final number of 37+6=<<37+6=43>>43 bananas.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much each roommate will pay in one year for their portion of the electricity bill, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost for all four rooms.
Each room has an electricity bill of $100 per month.

\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Cost per room}
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = 4 \times \$100 = \$400
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total annual cost for all four rooms.
There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the total monthly cost by 12.

\[
\text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total monthly cost} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Total annual cost} = \$400 \times 12 = \$4800
\]

### Step 3: Divide the total annual cost evenly among the four rooms.
We need to find out how much each room (including Jenna) pays annually.

\[
\text{Annual cost per room} = \frac{\text{Total annual cost}}{\text{Number of rooms}}
\]
\[
\text{Annual cost per room} = \frac{\$4800}{4} = \$1200
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much Jenna (and her three roommates) will contribute from her side.
Since there are four people sharing the costs, and she contributes half of what the other three do, we calculate Jenna's contribution as follows:

\[
\text{Jenna's share} = \frac{\text{Annual cost per room}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Jenna's share} = \frac{\$1200}{2} = \$600
\]

Thus, each roommate, including Jenna, will pay $600 per year for their portion of the electricity bill when divided equally.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 12 months in a year, so the total electricity for the year will cost 100*12 =$<<100*12=1200>>1200.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert dozens to individual items:**
   - A dozen equals 12.
   - 8 dozen glasses = \( 8 \times 12 = 96 \) glasses.
   - 4 dozen plates = \( 4 \times 12 = 48 \) plates.

2. **Calculate the total number of items initially sent:**
   - Total glasses sent = 96.
   - Total plates sent = 48.

3. **Determine how many items were returned:**
   - Broken glasses = 10.
   - Broken plates = 6.

4. **Calculate the number of items that remained after the return:**
   - Remaining glasses = Initial glasses sent - Broken glasses = \( 96 - 10 = 86 \).
   - Remaining plates = Initial plates sent - Broken plates = \( 48 - 6 = 42 \).

5. **Sum up the remaining items:**
   - Total remaining items = Remaining glasses + Remaining plates = \( 86 + 42 = 128 \).

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from her small stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 30 small stickers.
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded = \(30 \times 0.9 = 27\).
   - Since each large button is worth 3 small buttons, the number of large buttons she can get from these small stickers = \(27 / 3 = 9\) large buttons.

2. **Calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets from her large stickers:**
   - Lorraine has 40 large stickers.
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded = \(40 \times 0.5 = 20\).
   - Since each large button is worth 3 small buttons, the number of large buttons she can get from these large stickers = \(20 / 3 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) (but since we're dealing with whole buttons, she'll get exactly 6 large buttons).

3. **Calculate how many large buttons Lorraine gets in total:**
   - Total large buttons = Large buttons from small stickers + Large buttons from large stickers = \(9 + 6 = 15\) large buttons.

4. **Calculate how many small buttons Lorraine needs to trade to get those large buttons:**
   - From the large buttons, she trades 50% of them for small buttons.
   - Number of large buttons traded = \(15\).
   - Number of small buttons traded = \(15 \times 0.5 = 7.5\) small buttons.

5. **Calculate how many small buttons Lorraine has initially and after trading:**
   - Initial small stickers = 30.
   - Small stickers traded = 27 (as calculated above).
   - Final small stickers = \(30 - 27 = 3\).
   - Since each large button is worth 3 small buttons, the number of small buttons she can get from these remaining small stickers = \(3 / 3 = 1\) small button.

Therefore, by the end, Lorraine will have 1 small button.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Joey plays football every week.
- Last week, Joey played 3 matches (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).
- On Monday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Friday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday.

### Step 2: Determine the number of matches Joey played on Monday
From the information provided:
- On Monday, Joey played **1** match.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of matches Joey played on Friday
Given that on Friday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday:
\[ \text{Matches on Friday} = 2 \times (\text{Matches on Monday}) \]
\[ \text{Matches on Friday} = 2 \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Matches on Friday} = 2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of matches Joey played in one week
Now we sum up all the matches played throughout the week:
\[ \text{Total Matches} = \text{Matches on Monday} + \text{Matches on Tuesday} + \text{Matches on Wednesday} + \text{Matches on Friday} \]
Since there are no other days mentioned as having matches, assume Joey does not play any matches on Tuesday or Wednesday for simplicity.

Thus:
\[ \text{Total Matches} = 1 (\text{Monday}) + 0 (\text{Tuesday}) + 0 (\text{Wednesday}) + 2 (\text{Friday}) \]
\[ \text{Total Matches} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total Matches} = 3 \]

### Conclusion
Joey played a total of **3 matches** in one week. Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    A council met to vote on . a new regulation. The vote : passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of : votes in favor of the new regulation?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of people on the council**: 33.

2. Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
3. According to the problem, the number of votes against the new regulation is half the number of votes in favor. Therefore, the number of votes against the new regulation can be represented as \( \frac{F}{2} \).

4. Since the total number of votes cast (in favor or against) must equal 33, we can set up an equation based on these relationships:
   \[
   F + \frac{F}{2} = 33
   \]

5. To solve for \( F \), first combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3F}{2} = 33
   \]

6. Next, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   3F = 66
   \]

7. Finally, divide both sides by 3 to find \( F \):
   \[
   F = 22
   \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is **22**.<|im_end|>","Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.
Thus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.
Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of students needing different sizes.
- **Extra-Small (ES):** We know that 11 students need ES.
  
\[ \text{ES} = 11 \]

- **Small (S):** The problem states that twice as many students need S as ES.
  
\[ \text{S} = 2 \times \text{ES} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

- **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of students needing S.
  
\[ \text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18 \]

- **Large (L):** Six more students need L than those who need Large (extra-large).
  
\[ \text{L} = \text{L} + 6 \]

We can express L in terms of the total number of students (let’s call this \( T \)):

\[ \text{L} = T - (\text{ES} + \text{S} + \text{M}) \]
\[ \text{L} = T - (11 + 22 + 18) \]
\[ \text{L} = T - 51 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of shirts needed.
Now we add up all the sizes to find out how many shirts Krissa should order.

\[ \text{Total Shirts} = \text{ES} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} \]
\[ \text{Total Shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + (\text{L} + 6) \]

From Step 1, we have expressions for L and M but not yet for L. To proceed, we need to determine the value of \( T \).

### Step 3: Express the total number of shirts in terms of \( T \).
Since we don't have enough information to directly calculate \( \text{L} \), let's consider if there was an oversight or misunderstanding. Let's assume we've correctly determined \( T \).

Given \( T \):

\[ \text{L} = T - 51 \]

So,

\[ \text{Total Shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + (T - 51 + 6) \]
\[ \text{Total Shirts} = 51 + T \]

Since \( T \) represents the total number of students, and given that we don't have additional constraints or specific values for \( T \), we cannot directly compute \( \text{L} \). However, since we're asked about the total number of shirts ordered, and assuming \( T \) fits within reasonable limits for a typical school setting (e.g., fewer than 100 students), we can approximate:

If \( T \approx 50 \):
\[ \text{Total Shirts} = 51 + 50 = 101 \]

However, without knowing \( T \)'s exact value, we can only conclude based on the provided data:

\[
\boxed{101}
\]<|im_end|>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

She ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.
Altogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

Step 1: Determine the amount of the discount.
- The bag has a 5% discount on its original price.

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
- To find the discount amount, multiply the original price by the discount rate (as a decimal).
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$140 \times 0.05 \]

Step 3: Perform the multiplication to get the discount amount.
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$7 \]

Step 4: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.
\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = \$140 - \$7 \]

Step 5: Perform the subtraction to get the final price.
\[ \text{Final Price} = \$133 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the length of one playlist**

- We know that there are **300 songs** in one playlist.
  
**Step 2: Calculate the length of all songs in one playlist**

- Each song is **10 hours long**.

So, if we have 300 songs in one playlist, then the total length of songs in one playlist would be \(300 \times 10\) hours.

\[ \text{Total length for one playlist} = 300 \times 10 = 3000 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total length of all playlists combined**

Now, since John has **20** such playlists, we need to multiply the total length of one playlist by 20.

\[ \text{Total length for 20 playlists} = 3000 \times 20 \]

\[ \text{Total length for 20 playlists} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

2. **People who think ""horse"" will win**:
   - We know that 20% of these people think ""horse"".
   - Therefore, \( 0.2P \) people think ""horse"".

3. **Remaining people after those who think ""horse""**:
   - The remaining people are \( P - 0.2P = 0.8P \).

4. **People who think ""horse"" will win but not ""horse #12""**:
   - These people make up 60% of the remaining people.
   - So, \( 0.6 \times 0.8P = 0.48P \) people think ""horse"", but not ""horse #12"".

5. **People who think ""horse #12"" will win**:
   - This group makes up the rest of the remaining people.

                    ! Two thirds of Jana's ; puppies ! are Pomeranians. One : third of the Pomeranians are girls. If : there are , 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of Pomeranian puppies:**
   - We know that one-third of all Pomeranian puppies are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

Since these represent one-third of all Pomeranian puppies, we can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranian puppies (let's call this \( x \)):

\[
\frac{1}{3}x = 6
\]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**

Multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 6 \times 3
\]

\[
x = 18
\]

So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies in total.

3. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - The question states that two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Therefore, the total number of puppies (\( y \)) would be:

\[
y = \frac{2}{3}y
\]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**

Let's denote the total number of puppies as \( z \). According to the information given:

\[
z = \frac{2}{3}z
\]

To find \( z \), multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction on the left side:

\[
3z = 2z
\]

Subtract \( 2z \) from both sides:

\[
z = 0
\]

This result indicates that there must be no other types of puppies besides Pomeranians if the proportion described holds true.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the calculation shows that the total number of puppies equals zero, it implies that Jana has only Pomeranian puppies.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, we calculate how much money Jayden has after his sister gives him some of her allowance.
   - Jayden initially has $70.
   - He receives $45 (half of $90) from his sister.
   - So, his total becomes: $70 + $45 = $115.

2. Now, let's determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera.
   - The camera costs $200.
   - Jayden currently has $115.
   - Therefore, the additional amount needed is: $200 - $115 = $85.

3. To find out if Jayden actually has enough money or not, we compare it to what he might have received from his sister.
   - Since Jayden already has $115, he definitely has more than the required $85.

So, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many cases of shingles the third home will need, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of cases needed for the first house.

2. **Express Needs for Other Homes in Terms of \( x \):**
   - The second house needs half as much as the first, so it requires \( \frac{x}{2} \).
   - The third house needs twice as much as the first, so it requires \( 2x \).

3. **Sum All Needs:**
   According to the problem, the total amount of shingles needed for all three houses is 250 cases.
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250
   \]

4. **Combine Like Terms:**
   Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250
   \]
   Combine \( x \) terms:
   \[
   x + x + \frac{x}{2} + 2x = 250
   \]
   \[
   3x + \frac{x}{2} = 250
   \]

5. **Eliminate Fractions:**
   To eliminate fractions, multiply every term by 2:
   \[
   2(3x) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2(250)
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   6x + x = 500
   \]
   \[
   7x = 500
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 7:
   \[
   x = \frac{500}{7}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 71.4285714286 \approx 71.43
   \]

7. **Calculate Shingles Needed for Each House:**
   - First house: \( x = 71.43 \)
   - Second house: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{71.43}{2} = 35.715 \)
   - Third house: \( 2x = 2 \times 71.43 = 142.8571428571 \)

### Final Answer:
The third house will need approximately 142.86 cases of shingles. However, since shingles are typically sold in whole numbers or in standard quantities like 100 or 1000 cases, you might round up or down depending on local construction practices. Given this context, the most appropriate final answer would be rounded to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between pears and bananas:**
   - George has 45% more pears than bananas.

2. **Determine the number of pears based on the given information:**
   - We know that George has 200 bananas.
   - Let \( P \) represent the number of pears.
   - According to the problem, \( P = B + 0.45B \), where \( B \) is the number of bananas (which we already know is 200).

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits:**
   - The total number of fruits is the sum of pears and bananas.

Let's calculate the number of pears first:

\[

Since \( B = 200 \):

\[
P = 1.45 \times 200 = 290

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much money Marissa spent.
2. Calculate how many candy bars she could buy with that amount.

Let's go through it step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how much money Marissa spent
Marissa initially had $80. She bought a ball for $20. Therefore, the total amount she spent can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many candy bars she could buy
Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy with $60, we divide the total amount spent by the price per candy bar:
\[ \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\$60}{\$5} = 12 \]

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]<|im_end|>","If Marissa had $80 on her and used $20 to buy a ball, she remained with $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Sam would need to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per kilogram of oranges.
Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges to make 1 liter of juice. The cost of oranges is $3 per kilogram.

\[
\text{Cost per kilogram} = \$3
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.
Since 5 kilograms of oranges are required for 1 liter, we can calculate the total amount of oranges needed for 4 liters as follows:

\[
\text{Total kilograms needed} = \frac{5 \text{ kg/liter}}{1} \times 4 \text{ liters} = 20 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the oranges.
Now that we know Sam needs 20 kilograms of oranges, we can find out how much it will cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ kg} \times \$3/\text{kg} = \$60
\]

Therefore, Sam would need to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $60.<|im_end|>","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many books Ahmed read in one hour.
Ezra reads twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour. We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.

So, if \( x \) represents the number of books Ahmed read in one hour,
\[ x = \frac{300}{2} \]
\[ x = 150 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed together.
Now we add the number of books each person read:

- Ezra read 300 books.
- Ahmed read 150 books.

Therefore, the total number of books read by both of them is:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

### Final Answer:
They read a total of **450** books together.<|im_end|>","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tanya earned over the two days, we need to break down her earnings based on the number of classes she taught and any extra pay she received.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Monday's Earnings:
1. **Number of Classes**: Tanya teaches 4 classes.
2. **Hours Per Class**: Each class is 1 hour long (since there are no other specified times).
   - Total Hours = Number of Classes * Hours per Class
   - Total Hours = 4 * 1 = 4 hours

3. **Hourly Pay**: Tanya earns $15 per hour.
   - Total Hourly Pay = Hours Worked * Hourly Rate
   - Total Hourly Pay = 4 * $15 = $60

4. **Extra Pay**: Since she teaches more than 3 classes in one day, she receives an extra $5 per class.
   - Extra Pay = (Total Classes / 3) * Extra Pay Per Class
   - Extra Pay = (4 / 3) * $5 ≈ $6.67 (rounded up to $7 since partial classes count as full)

5. **Total Earnings on Monday**:
   - Total Earnings = (Hourly Pay + Extra Pay)
   - Total Earnings = ($60 + $7) = $67

#### Wednesday's Earnings:
1. **Number of Classes**: Tanya teaches 2 classes.
2. **Hours Per Class**: Each class is still 1 hour long.
   - Total Hours = Number of Classes * Hours per Class
   - Total Hours = 2 * 1 = 2 hours

3. **Hourly Pay**: Tanya earns $15 per hour.
   - Total Hourly Pay = Hours Worked * Hourly Rate
   - Total Hourly Pay = 2 * $15 = $30

4. **No Extra Pay**: Since she does not teach more than 3 classes in one day, she does not receive any extra pay.

5. **Total Earnings on Wednesday**:
   - Total Earnings = Total Hourly Pay
   - Total Earnings = $30

#### Total Earnings Over Two Days:
1. **Monday Earnings**: $67
2. **Wednesday Earnings**: $30

3. **Total Earnings**:
   - Total Earnings = Monday Earnings + Wednesday Earnings
   - Total Earnings = $67 + $30 = $97

### Final Answer:
\[

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

Step 1: Number of vanilla scents sold
- The company has 4 vanilla scents available initially.
- On that particular day, they sold 5 vanilla scents.

Step 2: Number of fruity scents sold
- The company has 8 fruity scents available initially.
- On that particular day, they sold 2 fruity scents.

Step 3: Calculate the difference
- To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold than fruity scents, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold.
  
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Number of vanilla scents sold} - \text{Number of fruity scents sold} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 5 - 2 \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 3 \]

Therefore, vanilla scents were sold 3 more times than fruity scents.<|im_end|>","The store sold 4 types of vanilla scents * 5 sales each = <<4*5=20>>20 of the vanilla scents.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for so that he makes a total of $135. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the revenue from selling eggs
Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from eggs} = 20 \times \$3 = \$60 \]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining amount needed after selling eggs
Subtract the revenue from eggs from the total desired profit.
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn
Bennet has 25 ears of corn that he can sell.
Let \( p \) be the price per ear of corn.
\[ \text{Total revenue from corn} = 25p \]
Since we already know he needs $75 more to reach $135, we set up the equation:
\[ 25p = \$75 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( p \)
Divide both sides by 25 to find the price per ear of corn.
\[ p = \frac{\$75}{25} = \$3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.<|im_end|>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60
Bennet needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 from the sale of his corn

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total time available.
Tatiana has two days in the weekend, one Saturday (7! hours) and one Sunday (5 hours), making it a total of \(7 + 5 = 12\) hours.

### Step 2: Subtract the time spent on other activities from the total time.
- Time spent reading: 3 hours
- Time spent playing video games: \(\frac{1}{3} \times (\text{remaining time})\)

Let's denote the remaining time after reading as \(R\).

\[ R = 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Now, calculate the time spent playing video games:

\[ \text{Time playing video games} = \frac{1}{3} \times R = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So far, we have:
- Reading: 3 hours
- Video games: 3 hours

### Step 3: Subtract the time spent on video games from the remaining time.
\[ Remaining time after video games = 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 4: Determine the time spent on soccer.
Since the remaining time is 6 hours and she spends half of that on soccer, we have:

\[ \text{Time spent on soccer} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent on soccer.
Total time in the weekend is 12 hours.

\[ Percentage spent on soccer = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3}{12} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Step 3: Determine how many pencils Anthony gives to Charlie from the remaining ones.
- Anthony then gives three-fifths of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

Step 4: Calculate the number of pencils left after giving some to Charlie.
- After giving away 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:

\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils} \]

Step 5: Conclusion
- The number of pencils that Anthony keeps is 10.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 10.<|im_end|>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent driving**

Jack drives for a certain distance (150 miles) at a speed of 75 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed

For one way trip:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} \]

\[ \text{Time} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he makes two round trips, we need to double this time:
\[ \text{Total Time Driving} = 2 \times 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Time Driving} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Add the time spent at the museum**

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

**Step 3: Sum up all times to find the total duration Jack is away from home**

- Total Time Driving: 4 hours
- Time Spent at Museum: 6 hours

Adding these together gives us the total time Jack is away from home.
\[ \text{Total Duration Away} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total Duration Away} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for **10 hours**.<|im_end|>","He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles

To solve this problem, we'll break down the information and perform calculations step-by-step.

1. **Calculate total number of wheels needed:**
   - For cars:
     Each car requires 4 wheels.
     Number of cars = 57.
     Total wheels from cars = \( 57 \times 4 \).

   \[
   57 \times 4 = 228
   \]

   - For motorcycles:
     Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
     Number of motorcycles = 73.
     Total wheels from motorcycles = \( 73 \times 2 \).

   \[
   73 \times 2 = 146
   \]

   - Summing up the wheels required for both cars and motorcycles:

   \[
   228 + 146 = 374
   \]

2. **Subtract the wheels already available from the total wheels needed:**

   Henry's box contains 650 wheels initially.

   Wheels remaining after assembly:

   \[
   650 - 374 = 276
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 276 wheels will be left if Henry assembles all the toys he needs.<|im_end|>","The total number of wheels needed for all the cars is 57 cars x 4 wheels/car = <<57*4=228>>228 wheels

Combining the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles gives a total of 228 wheels + 146 wheels = <<228+146=374>>374 wheels

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount.
- The original price of the laptop is $1000.
- The discount rate is 20%.

Discount = Original Price × Discount Rate
Discount = $1000 × 20/100
Discount = $200

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.

Final Price = Original Price - Discount
Final Price = $1000 - $200
Final Price = $800

Therefore, after applying the 20% discount, you would have to pay $800 for the laptop.

The final answer is: $800.<|im_end|>","You will get a discount of 20/100 x $1000 = $<<20/100*1000=200>>200.

                    question:
                    Mike decides he , wants to replace his movie , collection . with digital versions.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of movies in various series**

Mike has 600 movies in total.
A third of these are in various series.

\[
\text{Number of movies in various series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
\]

So, there are 200 movies that are part of different series.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining movies**

Subtract the number of movies in various series from the total number of movies:

\[
\text{Remaining movies} = 600 - 200 = 400
\]

So, there are 400 other movies left after accounting for the series.

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the remaining movies**

Out of the 400 remaining movies, 40% are older movies.

\[
\text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160
\]

So, there are 160 older movies.

Since each older movie costs $5:

\[
\text{Cost of older movies} = 160 \times 5 = \$800
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the cost of the movies not in series**

For the 200 movies that are in series, Mike gets them at half the cost of a regular movie. 

\[
\text{Cost per movie in series} = \frac{10}{2} = \$5
\]

Thus, the total cost for the movies in series would be:

\[
\text{Total cost for movies in series} = 200 \times 5 = \$1000
\]

**Step 5: Add up all the costs**

Now we add up the costs of the movies in series, the cost of the older movies, and the cost of the remaining movies.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$1000 + \$800 + \$1000 = \$2800
\]

Therefore, the total cost for replacing Mike’s movies with digital versions is **$2800**.<|im_end|>","There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fruits that Winston bought. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of peaches
- **Price per pound**: $2.00
- **Pounds purchased**: 6 pounds

\[
\text{Cost of peaches} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Pounds purchased}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of peaches} = \$2.00 \times 6 = \$12.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of plums
- **Price per pound**: $1.00
- **Pounds purchased**: 8 pounds

\[
\text{Cost of plums} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Pounds purchased}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of plums} = \$1.00 \times 8 = \$8.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of apricots
- **Price per pound**: $3.00
- **Pounds purchased**: 6 pounds

\[
\text{Cost of apricots} = \text{Price per pound} \times \text{Pounds purchased}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of apricots} = \$3.00 \times 6 = \$18.00
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs
Now, let's add up the costs of all the fruits:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of peaches} + \text{Cost of plums} + \text{Cost of apricots}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$38.00
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Winston spent a total of $38.00 on fruit.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance to their vacation spot based on the information provided about driving and hiking speeds.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total time spent on the trip:**
   - Total time = Time driving + Time hiking
   - Given: Total time = 6 hours (as stated in the problem)
   - Time hiking = 1.5 hours
   - Therefore, Time driving = Total time - Time hiking
     \[
     \text{Time driving} = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance driven using the formula:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Given: Average speed while driving = 50 mph
   - Given: Time driving = 4.5 hours
   - Let's denote the distance as \( D_d \).
     \[
     D_d = \text{Speed}_d \times \text{Time}_d
     \]
     \[
     D_d = 50 \text{ mph} \times 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     D_d = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distance hiked using the formula:**
   - Given: Average speed while hiking = 5 mph
   - Given: Time hiking = 1.5 hours
   - Let's denote the distance as \( D_h \).
     \[
     D_h = \text{Speed}_h \times \text{Time}_h
     \]
     \[
     D_h = 5 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     D_h = 7.5 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Verify if the given conditions for hiking match the calculated distance:**
   - According to the problem, the average hiking speed should be ""less than half their driving speed"".
   - Driving speed = 50 mph
   - Hiking speed = 5 mph
   - Half of the driving speed = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) mph
   - 5 mph is indeed less than 25 mph.
   
Thus, all conditions are satisfied.

5. **Sum up the distances to find the total distance to their vacation spot:**
   - Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = D_d + D_h
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 7.5 \text{ miles}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 232.5 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{232.5 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.

So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total scores for both Ava and Emma based on the given scoring system and then find the difference between their scores.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
   - Let \( E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of berries collected by Emma.
   - Let \( S_A \) be the time in seconds that Ava completes the level.
   - Let \( S_E \) be the time in seconds that Emma completes the level.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on.
     \[
     \text{Points from enemies} = 10A
     \]
   - Emma gets 5 points for each berry she collects.
     \[
     \text{Points from berries} = 5B
     \]
   - Ava gets 30 points for every second left on the timer when she finishes the level.
     \[
     \text{Points from timer} = 30S_A
     \]

3. **Calculate Points Based on Enemy Jumps:**
   - Ava's total points from jumping on enemies:
     \[
     \text{Ava's points from enemies} = 10A
     \]
   - Emma's total points from jumping on enemies:
     \[
     \text{Emma's points from enemies} = 10E
     \]

4. **Calculate Points Based on Berries Collected:**
   - Ava's total points from collecting berries:
     \[
     \text{Ava's points from berries} = 5B
     \]
   - Emma's total points from collecting berries:
     \[
     \text{Emma's points from berries} = 5B
     \]

5. **Calculate Points Based on Timer Time:**
   - Ava's total points from the timer:
     \[
     \text{Ava's points from timer} = 30S_A
     \]
   - Emma's total points from the timer:
     \[
     \text{Emma's points from timer} = 30S_E
     \]

6. **Determine the Difference in Scores:**
   - Since Ava has 8 more enemies jumped on than Emma and collects 3 more berries, let's substitute these values into our equations.

7. **Substitute Values into Equations:**
   - For enemies:
     \[
     10A = 10(A + 8)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     A = A + 8 \implies 10A = 10A + 80 \implies A = 80
     \]
   - For berries:
     \[
     5B = 5(B + 3)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     5B = 5B + 15 \implies B = 15
     \]

8. **Calculate Total Scores:**
   - Calculate Ava's total score:
     \[
     \text{Total Score}_A = 10A + 5B + 30S_A = 10(80) + 5(15) + 30S_A = 800 + 75 + 30S_A = 875 + 30S_A
     \]
   - Calculate Emma's total score:
     \[
     \text{Total Score}_E = 10E + 5B + 30S_E = 10(15) + 5(15) + 30S_E = 150 + 75 + 30S_E = 225 + 30S_E
     \]

9. **Find the Difference Between Their Scores:**
   - The difference in scores is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = (875 + 30S_A) - (225 + 30S_E) = 875 + 30S_A - 225 - 30S_E = 650 + 30(S_A - S_E)
     \]

Since \( S_A > S_E \), the difference will depend on whether \( S_A \) or \( S_E \) is larger. However, without knowing which player finished faster, we can only express the difference in terms of \( S_A \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{650 + 30(S_A -","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.

Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

1. **Calculate total rides per day:**
   - They ride 3 times a day.
   - Over 5 days, that's \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) rides per day.

2. **Calculate total rides over 7 days (a week):**
   - They ride twice as much on ""usual"" days.
   - On ""usual"" days, they ride \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) times a day.
   - There are 2 such days in a week.
   - So, on these ""usual"" days, they ride \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) times in total.

3. **Calculate total rides during the remaining days:**
   - The remaining days are not ""usual"".
   - On these days, they ride \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) times.
   - There are 5 days in total minus 2 days which are ""usual"", so there are \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) days left.
   - Therefore, on these non-""usual"" days, they ride \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \) times.

4. **Add up all the rides:**
   - Total rides per day: 15 rides.
   - Total rides over 5 days: \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \) rides.
   - Total rides on ""usual"" days: \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) rides.
   - Total rides on non-""usual"" days: \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \) rides.

<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial Counting
Bob initially has 7 fish in total:
- **Orange Fish**: 3
- **White Fish**: 4

### Step 2: Determine Total Number of Fish Added
Bob adds fish from the pet store such that the number of white and orange fish combined equals 17.

### Step 3: Set Up Equations
Let \( x \) represent the number of white fish Bob bought.
Since the total number of fish after adding those from the store equals 17, we have:
\[ 3 + 4 + x = 17 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the equation:
\[ 7 + x = 17 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Bob bought 10 white fish.

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
We need to verify if the remaining conditions are satisfied:
- **Total Fish After Addition**:
  - White Fish: 4 (initial) + 10 (bought) = 14
  - Orange Fish: 3 (initial) + 0 (no additional orange fish needed) = 3

This results in:
- Total Fish: 14 (white) + 3 (orange) = 17

Now, check if the ratio matches:
- The number of white fish is twice the number of orange fish:
  - 14 / 3 ≈ 4.67 (approximately twice)

Thus, the solution satisfies all given conditions.

### Final Answer
{The final answer is} Bob bought 10 white fish at the store.<|im_end|>","Bob started with 7 fish and bought seventeen, so he had 7 + 17 = <<7+17=24>>24 fish.
Let x = the number of white fish.
Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish, so 2*x + x = 24 fish
3*x = 24
x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8 white fish.
Bob started with 4 white fish, so he bought 8 - 4 = 4 white fish at the store.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the weekly mileage**

Andy drives his car to work from Monday to Friday, so that's 6 days in total.
Each day, the one-way distance is 5 miles, so for both ways it's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) miles.
Therefore, the total weekly mileage is \(6 \times 10 = 60\) miles.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly fuel consumption**

Given that Andy's car has an efficiency of 10 miles per gallon (MPG), we can calculate how many gallons of gas he consumes per week as follows:

\[
\text{Weekly Fuel Consumption} = \frac{\text{Total Weekly Mileage}}{\text{Mileage Per Gallon}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weekly Fuel Consumption} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of gas**

The current price of regular gas is $3 per gallon, so we can find out how much Andy spends on gas per week as follows:

\[
\text{Weekly Gas Cost} = \text{Weekly Fuel Consumption} \times \text{Price per Gallon}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weekly Gas Cost} = 6 \times 3 = \$18
\]

**Final Answer**
The final answer is $\boxed{18}$ dollars per week.<|im_end|>","Between Monday to Friday there are 5 days
If the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles the total round trip distance Andy drives daily is 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 miles
That means he drives a total of 10 miles * 5 days = <<10*5=50>>50 miles per week
If his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, then his car is consuming a total of 50 miles / 10 MPG = <<50/10=5>>5 gallons of gas each week
Given that each gallon of gas costs $3, then his car is consuming 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15 worth of gas each week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total value of the twenties**
Carrie has 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20.

Total value of twenties = 10 * $20 = $200

**Step 2: Calculate the total value of the quarters**
Carrie has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25.

Total value of quarters = 140 * $0.25 = $35

**Step 3: Determine how much Carrie spends on the lunch**
According to the problem, Carrie spends 3/5 of the twenties and 1/5 of the quarters (since she spends all the quarters).

Amount spent on twenties = (3/5) * $200 = $120

Amount spent on quarters = (1/5) * $35 = $7

**Step 4: Add up the amounts spent on the lunch**
Total amount spent on the lunch = Amount spent on twenties + Amount spent on quarters

Total amount spent on the lunch = $120 + $7 = $127

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is **$127**.<|im_end|>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35

The total amount of the twenties that she used is 6*$20 = $<<6*20=120>>120
She spent $120+$35 = $<<120+35=155>>155 on the lunch.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total yield from tomato plants:**
   - Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
   - Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes} = 22 \times 5 = 105 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total yield from eggplant plants:**
   - Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
   - Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

   \[
   \text{Total eggplants} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ eggplants}
   \]

3. **Add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:**

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 105 \text{ (tomatoes)} + 32 \text{ (eggplants)}

                    Samwell owns ; an appliances store. For this ! week, . one-fourth of their sales are . smart : TVs, : one-eighth are , analog TVs, and : the rest are ! OLED , TVs. If they were , able ! to sell a total ; of ? 40 TVs, how ! many OLED TVs : were they able to ? sell?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the fraction of sales that are OLED TVs:**
   - We know that one-fourth (1/4) of the sales are smart TVs.
   - One-eighth (1/8) of the sales are analog TVs.
   - The remaining part must be OLED TVs.

2. **Calculate the number of OLED TVs sold:**
   - First, we need to find out what fraction of the total sales are OLED TVs. Since the sum of all fractions must equal 1, we can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Fraction of sales for OLED TVs} = 1 - (\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8})
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
     \]
   - Now subtract this from 1:
     \[
     1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}
     \]

3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal or percentage if needed:**
   - This means that 5/8 of the sales are OLED TVs. To convert this to a more understandable form, we can multiply by 100%:
     \[
     \left(\frac{5}{8}\right) \times 100\% = 62.5\%
     \]

4. **Use the given total sales to find the actual number of OLED TVs sold:**
   - We are told that the store was able to sell a total of 40 TVs. Let \( x \) represent the total number of TVs sold.
   - According to our calculation, 62.5% of \( x \) should equal 40 TVs:
     \[
     0.625x = 40
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{40}{0.625} = 64
     \]

So, the store was able to sell 64 TVs in total. To find out how many of these were OLED TVs, we use the fact that OLED TVs make up 5/8 of the total sales:
   \[
   \text{Number of OLED TVs sold} = \left(\frac{5}{8}\right) \times 64
   \]
   Calculate this:
   \[
   \left(\frac{5}{8}\right) \times 64 = 40
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 40 OLED TVs were sold.<|im_end|>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.
He was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.
So, he was able to sell 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 Analog and Smart TVs.
Therefore, the total number of OLED TVs that he was able to sell is 40 - 15 = <<40-15=25>>25.

1. Determine how much money John will receive from the school.
2. Calculate how much more money John needs after accounting for his initial amount.

Step 1: Determine how much money John will receive from the school.
- The school decides to cover half the cost of the trip.
- The total cost of the trip is $300.
- Therefore, the school will cover $300 / 2 = $150.

Step 2: Calculate how much more money John needs.
- John initially has $50.
- The school will contribute $150.
- To find out how much more money John needs, subtract his initial amount from what the school will provide:
  $150 - $50 = $100.

Therefore, John is missing $100 to reach his goal of covering the cost of the trip. 

The final answer is: The final answer is: John is missing $100.<|im_end|>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the total temperature drop needed:**
   - The maximum safe temperature for the pipes is 32°F.
   - During the day, the temperature is 45°F.
   - During the night, the temperature drops further due to the cold air outside.

   First, calculate the difference between the day temperature (45°F) and the minimum safe temperature (32°F):
   \[
   \text{Day Temperature Drop} = 45°F - 32°F = 13°F
   \]

   Next, account for the additional coldness at night. The temperature decreases by 8°F more than the difference calculated above because it's 33°F cooler at night compared to the day:
   \[
   \text{Night Temperature Drop} = 8°F + (\text{Day Temperature Drop}) = 8°F + 13°F = 21°F
   \]

2. **Determine the total temperature drop required:**
   - The total temperature drop must be equal to or less than the pipe freezing point of 32°F.
   - Calculate the total temperature drop:
   \[
   \text{Total Temperature Drop} = 13°F + 21°F = 34°F
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of logs needed:**
   - Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5°F.
   - To find out how many logs are needed, divide the total temperature drop by the temperature increase per log:
   \[
   \text{Number of Logs Needed} = \frac{\text{Total Temperature Drop}}{\text{Temperature Increase Per Log}} = \frac{34°F}{5°F/\log} = 6.8\log
   \]
   
Since you can't have a fraction of a log, round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Carson needs 7 logs to ensure that the temperature rise from burning these logs is sufficient to keep the pipes warm enough to avoid freezing.

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is 7 logs.<|im_end|>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees

   - Number of groups = Total number of people / People per group
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought back by all groups combined:**
   - According to the problem, 3/5 of these groups brought back 2 seashells each.
   - Number of groups that brought back seashells = (3/5) * Total number of groups
   \[
   \text{Number of groups that brought back seashells} = \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \times 10 = 6

   - Seashells per group = 2
   - Total seashells = Number of groups that brought back seashells × Seashells per group

= $20/hour × 8 hours
= $160

So far, Jamie has earned **$160** from her regular job.

**Step 2: Determine her overtime pay**

On this specific day (Tuesday), Jamie worked an extra 3 hours (11 hours total - 8 hours regular).

Overtime pay = Overtime hours × Regular hourly wage
= 3 hours × $20/hour
= $60

**Step 3: Add the regular earnings and overtime pay together**

Total payment = Regular earnings + Overtime pay
= $160 + $60
= $220

Therefore, Jamie was paid **$220** for her work that day.<|im_end|>","The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lions in the enclosure based on the given information.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of male lions
- The zookeeper counts 12 female lions.
- Half as many male lions as female lions.

\[
\text{Number of male lions} = \frac{\text{Number of female lions}}{2}
\]

Substituting the number of female lions:

\[
\text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of lions (including cubs)
- We know there are 12 female lions, 6 male lions, and 14 lion cubs.

\[
\text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of cubs}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is **32**.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 32.<|im_end|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 male lions in the enclosure.

To determine how much change Mike will get back after buying the jeans at the discounted price, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The original price of the jeans is $40.
   - The jeans are on sale for 25% off.

   To find out how much this discount is, multiply the original price by the percentage (converted to decimal):
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \$40 \times 0.25 = \$10
   \]

2. **Calculate the sale price:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \$40 - \$10 = \$30
   \]

3. **Determine the change from the $50 bill:**
   - Mike uses a $50 bill to pay for the jeans.
   - We subtract the sale price ($30) from the $50 bill:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$50 - \$30 = \$20
   \]

Therefore, Mike will have $20 left over after purchasing the jeans.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of employees hired over time**:
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.
   - We need to find out how many employees there will be after three months.

2. **Calculate the total number of employees after three months**:
   - Start with the initial number of employees (200).
   - Multiply that by the hiring rate (20) for each of the three months.

Let's perform the calculations:

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### Initial Number of Employees
- Initial number of employees: \( 200 \)

#### Monthly Hires
- Hiring rate: 20 employees/month

#### After Three Months
- Calculate the total number of employees hired in three months:
\[ \text{Total hired} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

#### Total Number of Employees
- Add the hired employees to the initial number:
\[ \text{Total employees} = 200 + 60 = 260 \]

#### Salary Per Employee Per Month
- Each employee receives a monthly salary of $4000.

#### Total Amount Paid Per Employee Over Three Months
- Multiply the monthly salary by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly payment} = 4000 \times 3 = 12000 \]

#### Total Amount Paid To All Employees
- Multiply the monthly payment by the total number of employees:
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 12000 \times 260 = 31,200,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[
\boxed{31,200,000}
\]<|im_end|>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees

In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.

1. **Determine the number of times each song is performed:**
   - ""Deck the Halls"": planned to be sung twice.
   - ""Jingle Bells"": planned to be sung once.

2. **Calculate the total duration for ""Deck the Halls"":**
   - Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.
   - Since it is planned to be sung twice, we multiply the length of one performance by two:
     \[
     150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total duration for ""Jingle Bells"":**
   - Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.
   - Since it is planned to be sung once, we multiply the length of one performance by one:
     \[
     240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Add the durations together to find the total time spent singing:**
   - Add the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" (300 seconds) and the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" (240 seconds):
     \[
     300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine Billy's initial hourly wage.
Billy was initially paid at a rate of $10 per hour for the first two months.

### Step 2: Calculate Billy's total earnings after the raise.
After receiving a raise of $0.50 per hour, Billy's new hourly wage becomes $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

Since Billy worked 20 hours, we can calculate his total earnings as follows:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Number of Hours Worked} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$10.50 \times 20 \]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation.
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$10.50 \times 20 = \$210 \]

So, Billy earned $210 after the raise.

### Step 4: Determine Sally's starting hourly wage.
Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy’s starting salary. Since Billy's starting wage is $10 per hour, Sally's starting wage would be:
\[ \text{Sally's Starting Wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Sally's total earnings.
If Sally works 20 hours, she earns:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$10.50 \times 20 \]

### Step 6: Perform the calculation.
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$10.50 \times 20 = \$210 \]

So, Sally also earned $210 after the raise.

### Step 7: Compare the earnings to find out who earns more.
Both Billy and Sally earn the same amount after their raises. Therefore, neither of them earns more money than the other.

### Conclusion:
The final answer is: The final answer is $\boxed{\$0}$ (since they have the same earnings).<|im_end|>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of 2 bagels**
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, for 2 bagels, the total cost would be \(2 \times \$1 = \$2\).

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two totals**

   - Pierson scored 278 points.

First, calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[ \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Next, add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
\[ 139 + 11 = 150 \]

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

2. **Calculate the total number of points:**
   - Add Pierson's score to Nikita's score to get the total:
   \( 278 + 150 = 428 \)

Therefore, the total number of points that Pierson and Nikita had together is 428 points.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of children in the school.
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has an average of 25 students.
   - Therefore, the total number of children = 40 * 25.

2. Calculate the total number of teachers in the school.
   - There are 3 teachers per class.
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Therefore, the total number of teachers = 3 * 40.

3. Calculate the total number of trees planted by the children.
   - Each child plants one tree.
   - Total number of children = 40 * 25.
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by children = 40 * 25.

4. Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
   - Each teacher plants two trees.
   - Total number of teachers = 3 * 40.
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by teachers = (3 * 40) * 2.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of stuffed animals currently in Bubbles' collection:**
   - Stuffed puppies: 3
   - Stuffed koalas: 5
   - Stuffed zebras: 2
   - Stuffed frogs: 4
   
   Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

   - Desired percentage: 30%

3. **Set up an equation to find out how many additional stuffed goats (G) should be bought so that the new total matches the desired percentage:**

   \[
   \frac{14 + G}{14 + G} = 0.30
   \]

4. **Solve for \( G \):**

   First, multiply both sides by \( 14 + G \):

   \[
   14 + G = 0.30 \times (14 + G)
   \]

   Distribute the 0.30 on the right side:

   \[
   14 + G = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times G
   \]

   Simplify the right side:

   \[
   14 + G = 4.2 + 0.30G
   \]

   Subtract 4.2 from both sides:

   \[
   14 - 4.2 = G - 0.30G
   \]

   Combine like terms:

   \[
   9.8 = 0.70G
   \]

   Divide both sides by 0.70:

   \[
   G = \frac{9.8}{0.70}

                    question:
                    Kris is trying to ! earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours. If Kris plays for half an hour every ; day ? for 2 weeks then plays for 2 hours every day ! for ; a week, ; how many hours : does she still need to ? play to : earn the achievement?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days Kris has played so far:**
   - For the first two weeks (14 days):
     \[
     2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
     \]
   - For the last week (7 days):
     \[
     7 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Sum up all the days played:**
   \[
   14 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played:**
   - Half-hour increments per day:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \text{ hour/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 10.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining hours needed to reach 30 hours:**
   \[
   30 \text{ hours} - 10.5 \text{ hours} = 19.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play for a total of \(19.5\) hours to earn her video game achievement.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{19.5}\).<|im_end|>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.
So playing for half an hour every day means Kris will have played for 0.5 hours * 14 days = <<0.5*14=7>>7 hours.
Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far apart the two cars will be after they have traveled for 2 hours at their respective speeds.

1. **Calculate the distance covered by the faster car in 2 hours:**
   - Speed = 70 miles/hour
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{faster} = 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the slower car in 2 hours:**
   - Speed = 60 miles/hour
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{slower} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the initial gap between the two cars:**
   - Initial gap = Distance covered by the slower car
   \[
   \text{Initial Gap} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance between the two cars after 2 hours:**
   - Total distance = Distance covered by the faster car + Initial gap
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 140 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 260 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, after 2 hours, the two cars will be separated by \( \boxed{260} \) miles.<|im_end|>","In two hours, the first car will have traveled 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 miles.
Similarly, the second car will have traveled 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 miles.
Thus, the cars are separated by 140 - 120 = <<140-120=20>>20 miles after two hours.

   - Diamond: $600
   - Gold: $300
   - Total cost before premium = Diamond + Gold = $600 + $300 = $900

2. **Calculate the premium amount**:
   - Premium rate: 30%
   - Premium amount = Total cost before premium × Premium rate
   - Premium amount = $900 × 0.30 = $270

3. **Add the premium to the original total cost**:
   - Final payment = Original total cost + Premium amount
   - Final payment = $900 + $270 = $1170

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students who passed in each grade group**

- Third Graders:
\[ \text{Number of third-graders} = 340 \]
\[ \text{Pass rate for third-grade students} = \frac{340}{500} \]

\[
\frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \quad \text{(or 68%)}
\]

- Fourth Graders:
\[ \text{Number of fourth-graders} = 100 \]
\[ \text{Pass rate for fourth-grade students} = \frac{40}{100} \]

\[
\frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \quad \text{(or 40%)}
\]

- Fifth Graders:
\[ \text{Number of fifth-graders} = 400 \]
\[ \text{Pass rate for fifth-grade students} = 2 \times (\text{pass rate for fourth-grade students}) \]

\[
2 \times 0.4 = 0.8 \quad \text{(or 80%)}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students who passed across all grades**

\[
\text{Total number of students who passed} = 340 + 40 + (400 \times 0.8)
\]

\[
\text{Total number of students who passed} = 340 + 40 + 320
\]

\[
\text{Total number of students who passed} = 700
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the overall pass rate**

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of students who passed}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \left( \frac{700}{500} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = 1.4 \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = 140\%
\]

Therefore, the school's overall pass rate is **140%**.<|im_end|>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4

Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students

                    Milo is making a ; mosaic with chips of glass. ; It takes twelve glass chips ; to make every ! square inch of : the mosaic. A bag of glass ! chips holds 72 chips. ?

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips needed:**
   - Each square inch requires 12 glass chips.
   - The mosaic is 3 inches tall.

\[
\text{Total chips needed} = \text{Area in square inches} \times \text{Chips per square inch}
\]

\[
\text{Total chips needed} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ chips}
\]

2. **Determine the number of bags required:**
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.
   
\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{\text{Total chips needed}}{\text{Chips per bag}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{36}{72} = 0.5 \text{ bags}
\]

Since you can't have half a bag, you would need to round up or down based on practical considerations (e.g., if it's not possible to use less than one whole bag). For simplicity, let's assume Milo uses full bags as instructed.

3. **Calculate the total length of the mosaic:**
   - Since each square inch requires 12 chips and there are 3 square inches in the mosaic,
   
\[
\text{Length of mosaic} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ chips}
\]

4. **Convert the length from chips to inches:**
   - Each chip represents 1 inch.

\[
\text{Length of mosaic in inches} = 36 \text{ chips} \times 1 \text{ inch/chip} = 36 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 36 inches long. 

**The final answer is:** 36 inches long.<|im_end|>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.

Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of tea consumed:**
   - Four students each drank \(1.5\) quarts.
     \[
     4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   - Sixteen students each drank \(2\) quarts.
     \[
     16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
     \]

2. **Sum the amounts of tea consumed:**
   \[
   6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}
   \]

3. **Determine the initial amount of tea:**
   - We know that there are \(10\) quarts remaining after the consumption.
   - Therefore, the initial amount of tea must be equal to the sum of what was consumed plus what remains.
   \[
   38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}
   \]

4. **Convert the initial amount from quarts to gallons:**
   - Since \(1\) gallon equals \(4\) quarts, we convert \(48\) quarts to gallons by dividing by \(4\).
   \[
   \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was \(\boxed{12}\) gallons.<|im_end|>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of butterscotch candies Dale has sold.
Dale initially had 150 butterscotch candies in stock before ordering additional ones.

He then ordered an extra 100 butterscotch candies.

Total butterscotch candies Dale currently has:
\[ \text{Total sold} = 150 + 100 = 250 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of butterscotch candies Dale wants to sell.
Since Dale already has 250 butterscotch candies, we need to calculate how many more he needs to reach his goal.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell.
Dale originally planned to sell all 250 butterscotch candies he now has plus any he might order later.

However, since he only needs to sell as much as he already has (250), and he has exactly that amount, there is no need to sell any more.

Therefore, Dale **still** needs to sell **zero** butterscotch candies.

### Final Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students at the end of the year:**
   - The number of students doubles every month.
   - Starting from the beginning of the year with 10 students.

2. **Calculate the number of months in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.

3. **Use the formula for exponential growth to find the number of students after 12 months:**

   \[
   N = P \times (1 + r)^n
   \]

   Where:
   - \(N\) is the number of students at the end of the year.
   - \(P\) is the initial number of students.
   - \(r\) is the rate of increase per period (monthly).
   - \(n\) is the number of periods (months).

4. **Calculate the monthly increase factor \(r\):**
   
   Since the number of students doubles each month, the monthly increase factor \(r\) is 2.

5. **Substitute into the formula:**

   \[
   N = 10 \times (1 + 2)^{12}
   \]

6. **Simplify and calculate:**

   \[
   N = 10 \times (3)^{12}
   \]
   
   Calculate \(3^{12}\):

   \[
   3^{12} = 531441
   \]

   Therefore,

   \[
   N = 10 \times 531441 = 5314410
   \]

7. **Determine the number of students at the beginning of May:**
   - Start with the number of students at the beginning of the year (end of February).

   Using the same doubling rule:

   \[
   \text{Students at the beginning of May} = 10 \times 2^3 = 80

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total earnings**: Felix made $105 during the week.

2. **Determine the cost per branch**: Each branch climbs costs $0.25.

3. **Calculate the number of branches climbed**:
   - Divide the total earnings ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25):
     \[
     \text{Number of branches} = \frac{\$105}{\$0.25} = 420
     \]

4. **Determine the number of days in the week**:
   - Assuming a standard workweek (Monday to Friday), there are typically 5 days.

5. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day**:
   - Divide the total number of branches climbed (420) by the number of days in the workweek (5):
     \[

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many petals are left after Rose has picked all her flowers and dropped some along the way. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of flowers:**
   - 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
   - 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
   - 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
   - 6 flowers with 7 petals each.

2. **Calculate total petals before dropping any:**
   - From the first set: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - From the second set: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - From the third set: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - From the fourth set: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

   Adding these up gives us the total number of petals initially: 
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Determine which flowers were dropped:**
   - We know that Rose dropped one flower from each type (since each type was represented only once).

4. **Calculate the number of flowers remaining after dropping:**
   - After dropping one flower from each type, the counts remain unchanged because the same number of flowers of each type are still present.
   - So, there are still 3 flowers with 5 petals each,
     4 flowers with 6 petals each,
     5 flowers with 4 petals each,
     and 6 flowers with 7 petals each.

5. **Calculate the total number of petals remaining after dropping:**
   - From the first set: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
   - From the second set: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
   - From the third set: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
   - From the fourth set: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

   Adding these up gives us the total number of petals remaining:
   \[
   15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is:
\[
\boxed{101}
\]<|im_end|>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.

   - John makes 9 S'mores.
   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow.
   - Therefore, John uses 9 marshmallows.

2. **Account for marshmallows dropped:**
   - They drop 3 marshmallows on the ground.

3. **Calculate remaining marshmallows after use and dropping:**
   - Total marshmallows initially = 35
   - Marshmallows used = 9
   - Marshmallows dropped = 3
   - Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 9 - 3 = 23

4. **Calculate number of S'mores each can make with the remaining marshmallows:**
   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow.
   - Number of S'mores each can make with 23 marshmallows = 23 / 1 = 23

Therefore, each kid (John and DeSean) can make 23 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

                    question:
                    A new arcade opens ; up and Jack decides to play with his 3 friends.  Jack can play a game with 1 : quarter for 20 minutes.  Two of his friends are significantly worse than him ? and can only play half as long.  One of them is significantly better and can play ! for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.  How ? much money is used?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much money was spent on games, we need to calculate the total time played by all participants and then use that information to find out how many quarters were needed.

Step 1: Determine the number of players.
Jack has 3 friends who join him in the arcade. Including Jack himself, there are 4 players in total.

Step 2: Calculate the time each player plays.
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- The friend who is significantly worse can play for \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) minutes.
- The friend who is significantly better can play for \( 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \) minutes.

Step 3: Convert the total playing time into minutes.
Since they played for 4 hours, we convert this to minutes: 
\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 4: Sum up the individual playing times.
\[ 20 + 10 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 5: Determine how many quarters are needed based on their respective playing durations.
- Jack needs \( \frac{20}{\text{quarter}} \) quarters.
- The friend who is significantly worse needs \( \frac{10}{\text{quarter}} \) quarters.
- The friend who is significantly better needs \( \frac{30}{\text{quarter}} \) quarters.

Let's assume one quarter equals $0.25 (since typically a quarter costs 25 cents). Therefore, the cost per minute for each player would be calculated accordingly:

- Jack’s cost per minute: \( \frac{\text{cost of one quarter}}{20 \text{ minutes}} \).
- Friend 1 (worse): \( \frac{\text{cost of one quarter}}{10 \text{ minutes}} \).
- Friend 2 (better): \( \frac{\text{cost of one quarter}}{30 \text{ minutes}} \).

Now let's calculate these costs:
- Jack’s cost per minute: \( \frac{0.25}{20} = 0.0125 \) dollars per minute.
- Friend 1 (worse): \( \frac{0.25}{10} = 0.025 \) dollars per minute.
- Friend 2 (better): \( \frac{0.25}{30} = 0.00833 \) dollars per minute.

Summing these up gives us the total cost per minute:
\[ 0.0125 + 0.025 + 0.00833 = 0.04533 \] dollars per minute.

Finally, multiply the total playing time by the cost per minute to get the total amount spent:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \times 0.04533 \text{ dollars/minute} = 10.8792 \text{ dollars} \approx 10.88 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub. Let's break down the information given:

1. The total volume of the jar is 10 ounces.
2. Each batch contains the same amount of ingredients.
3. We need to find out how much oil is used.

Let's denote the amount of each ingredient (salt, oil, fragrance) that goes into one batch as follows:
- Salt = \( S \)
- Oil = \( O \)
- Fragrance = \( F \)

From the problem statement, we know:
1. \( S + O + F = 10 \) (since the total volume of the jar is 10 ounces)
2. \( S = F \) (same amount of salt as fragrance)
3. \( S = 2O \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = 2F \) (twice as much fragrance as salt)

Since \( S = F \), it means \( S = 2O \). This implies \( S = 2S \).

Now let's substitute these values back into our equations:

1. \( S + O + F = 10 \)
2. Since \( S = F \), we can say \( S = F \).
3. And since \( S = 2O \), we have \( F = 2O \).

Substituting \( F = 2O \) into the first equation gives us:
\[ S + O + 2O = 10 \]
\[ S + 3O = 10 \]

We also know \( S = 2O \), so substituting \( S = 2O \) into the equation above gives us:
\[ 2O + 3O = 10 \]
\[ 5O = 10 \]
\[ O = 2 \]

So, Tanya uses 2 ounces of oil per batch.

Therefore, the number of ounces of oil Tanya uses is: {The final answer is} 2 ounces.<|im_end|>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying cows**
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

Total cost for cows = Number of cows × Cost per cow

**Step 3: Add the total costs together**
- Total cost for goats + Total cost for cows

   - We know that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate Joe's remaining cars after selling 20%:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his total cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe had initially was 40.
   - Selling 20% means he sells \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.
   - After selling these cars, Joe remains with \( 40 - 8 = 32 \) cars.

3. **Calculate Joe's remaining cars after giving away twice as many cars as he sold:**
   - Joe gave away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars, so he gave away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.
   - After giving away these cars, Joe remains with \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) cars.

Therefore, Joe remains with 16 cars after selling and giving some to his mother. {The final answer is} 16 cars.<|im_end|>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Calculate the total time Sandy walked over both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

### Step 1: Determine the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day

Sandy walked twice her walking distance on the second day. Since the first day's distance was \(d\) miles, the second day's distance would be \(\frac{d}{2}\) miles.

Since Sandy walks at the same speed, the time taken to cover \(\frac{d}{2}\) miles on the second day would be \(\frac{\frac{d}{2}}{v} = \frac{d}{2v}\), where \(v\) is her walking speed.

Given that Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day, we can assume she walked at a constant speed. Let's denote her walking speed as \(v\).

### Step 2: Calculate the total time Sandy walked over both days

On the first day, she walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked for \(\frac{d}{2v}\) hours.

Total time = Time on the first day + Time on the second day
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 + \frac{d}{2v} \]

### Step 3: Convert the total time from hours to minutes

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time into minutes.

First, calculate the total time in hours:
\[ \text{Total time (hours)} = 8 + \frac{d}{2v} \]

Next, convert this to minutes:
\[ \text{Total time (minutes)} = 8 \times 60 + \left( \frac{d}{2v} \right) \times 60 \]

                    question:
                    . Hunter counted , 50 ? cars ! packed ! in ; their : school parking ? lot when entering class . one morning. : During ? the first break, he counted , 20 more ! cars ! in , the parking lot.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. First, we need to determine the initial count of cars on the parking lot.

   - Hunter initially counted 50 cars.
   - He then counted an additional 20 cars during the lunch break.
   
2. We know that after these counts, half of the total number of cars was already present on the parking lot. 

3. Let's denote the total number of cars as \( C \).

4. According to the information given, half of \( C \) were already present, so \( \frac{C}{2} \) cars were there.

5. The difference between the new count (after the lunch break) and the initial count should equal the remaining cars needed to reach half of the total.

6. Therefore, \( 20 = C - \frac{C}{2} \)

7. Simplifying the equation: 
   \[
   20 = \frac{C}{2}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   40 = C
   \]

8. So, the total number of cars counted during lunch break is 40.

Therefore, the final answer is: The total number of cars Hunter counted during lunch break is 40.<|im_end|>","During the first break, he saw 20 more cars in the parking lot, which totals 50 + 20 = <<50+20=70>>70 cars
When going for the lunch break, he counted and realized only half the number of cars were present, which is 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of tasks John completes in one cycle.
John does 30 cycles per day, and each cycle consists of 5 different tasks.

\[ \text{Total tasks per cycle} = 30 \times 5 = 150 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money John earns from completing one cycle.
Each task pays $1.20.

\[ \text{Money earned per cycle} = 150 \times 1.20 = \$180 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money John makes in one day.
Since John completes 30 cycles every day:

\[ \text{Money made per day} = 180 \times 30 = \$5400 \]

### Step 4: Determine the total amount of money John makes in a full 7-day week.
If John works for 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Money made in a week} = 5400 \times 7 = \$37800 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, John makes $\boxed{37800}$ if he works a full 7-day week.<|im_end|>","Each cycle pays 5*$1.2=$<<5*1.2=6>>6

1. Calculate Julie's score in the first game.
2. Determine Sasha's score in the second game based on the information given.
3. Sum up the scores from both games.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Calculate Julie's score in the first game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game.
   \[
   \text{Julie's score in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10

2. **Determine Sasha's score in the second game:**
   - Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game.
   \[
   \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4
   \]

Now, let's sum up the scores from both games:

\[
\text{Total points for Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game}
\]
\[
\text{Total points for Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cans for cat food:**
   - Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
   - Each package contains 11 tins.
   - Therefore, the total number of cans for cat food = \( 8 \times 11 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of cans for dog food:**
   - Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
   - Each package contains 6 tins.
   - Therefore, the total number of cans for dog food = \( 6 \times 6 \).

3. **Subtract the total number of cans for dog food from the total number of cans for cat food to find out how many more cans of cat food Kimberly bought:**

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cans for cat food
\[
8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins per package} = 88 \text{ tins}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cans for dog food
\[
6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins per package} = 36 \text{ tins}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total number of cans for dog food from the total number of cans for cat food
\[
88 \text{ tins (cat food)} - 36 \text{ tins (dog food)} = 52 \text{ tins}
\]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{52}\).<|im_end|>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve them step by step.

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the number of cards Becca has,
- \( S \) as the number of cards Smendrick has,
- \( P \) as the number of cards PJ has.

We know from the problem statement:
1. The total number of cards is 341.
\[ B + S + P = 341 \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
\[ B = S + 12 \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.
\[ S = 3P \]

Now let's substitute these expressions into the first equation:

From \( S = 3P \), we can express \( S \) in terms of \( P \).
Substitute \( S = 3P \) into \( B = S + 12 \):
\[ B = 3P + 12 \]

Now substitute \( B = 3P + 12 \) and \( S = 3P \) into the total cards equation:
\[ (3P + 12) + 3P + P = 341 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Now solve for \( P \):
\[ 7P = 341 - 12 \]
\[ 7P = 329 \]
\[ P = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ P = 47 \]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \):

Since \( S = 3P \):
\[ S = 3 \times 47 \]
\[ S = 141 \]

And since \( B = S + 12 \):
\[ B = 141 + 12 \]
\[ B = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has **153** cards.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of cards PJ has

Let's break down the information provided and solve this step-by-step.

1. **Identify the number of eggs for each color:**
   - Green eggs: 5 (given)
   - Blue eggs: Twice as many as green eggs = 2 * 5 = 10 (since it's ""twice as many"")
   - Pink eggs: One fewer than blue eggs = 10 - 1 = 9 (one less than the blue count)
   - Yellow eggs: One-third as many as pink eggs = 3 * 9 = 27 (one-third of the pink count)

2. **Sum up all the eggs:**
   - Green eggs: 5
   - Blue eggs: 10
   - Pink eggs: 9
   - Yellow eggs: 27

Now let's add these together:

\[ \text{Total eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 27 \]

Performing the addition:

\[ 5 + 10 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]
\[ 24 + 27 = 51 \]

Therefore, Cindy has a total of **51** eggs altogether.<|im_end|>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.

And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.
Added all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of returning the book using two different methods: her own method (shipping) and Amazon's service (refund). Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Shipping Cost Using Her Own Method

**Given Data:**
- Book weight = 4 pounds
- Cost per pound for shipping = $0.35
- Distance to distribute center = 20 miles
- Additional charge per mile = $0.08 per mile

**Calculation:**

First, calculate the cost based on the weight of the book:
\[ \text{Cost based on weight} = 4 \times \$0.35 = \$1.40 \]

Next, calculate the additional cost due to distance:
\[ \text{Additional cost based on distance} = 20 \times \$0.08 = \$1.60 \]

Now, sum these costs to get the total shipping cost:
\[ \text{Total shipping cost} = \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

So, the total cost Milly would incur if she used her own shipping method is **$3.00**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Refund from Amazon

**Given Data:**
- Purchase price of the book = $32
- Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price

**Calculation:**

Calculate the refund amount:
\[ \text{Refund amount} = \$32 \times 0.75 = \$24.00 \]

So, the amount refunded by Amazon is **$24.00**.

### Step 3: Determine How Much Money Milly Will Lose

Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, Milly will not lose any money because the refund covers all or part of her payment.

Therefore, the amount of money Milly will lose is **nothing**, as she will receive full compensation from Amazon.

### Conclusion:

Milly will not lose any money; instead, she will gain **$24.00** from Amazon's refund program.

Thus, the final answer is: 
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is nothing}}
\]<|im_end|>","Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60
Milly loses $8 + $1.40 + $1.60 = $<<8+1.4+1.6=11>>11

   - Total after receiving money from father: 
     \[
     40 + 100 = 140

3. **Calculating total spent**:
    - Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.

5. **Final calculation**:
    - Subtract the total amount spent from the initial total:

To determine how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chocolates produced in the second week.
2. Determine the number of chocolates produced in the third week based on the information provided.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chocolates produced in the second week.
- The second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
- First week production = 8,000 bars
- Second week production = 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars

Step 2: Determine the number of chocolates produced in the third week.
- Third week production = 3 times the first week's production
- First week production = 8,000 bars
- Third week production = 3 * 8,000 = 24,000 bars

Now that we know the total production for the first three weeks, let's calculate the production for the fourth week.

Total monthly production = 50,000 bars
Production for the first three weeks + Production for the fourth week = Total monthly production

Let \( x \) be the number of bars produced in the fourth week.

\[
8,000 (\text{first week}) + 4,000 (\text{second week}) + 24,000 (\text{third week}) + x = 50,000
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
36,000 + x = 50,000
\]

Subtract 36,000 from both sides:

\[
x = 50,000 - 36,000

                    question:
                    Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok, and 15 minutes ; six days a week doing her makeup . before filming herself for TikTok.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities and calculate the total time spent each week, then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate weekly time spent on TikTok:**

   - Writing amateur songs: \(2\) hours per week.
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - Doing makeup: \(6\) days per week, \(15\) minutes each day.
     \[
     6 \times 15 \text{ minutes/day} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

   - Total time spent on TikTok per week:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes (writing)} + 90 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 210 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate monthly time spent on TikTok:**

   - There are \(4\) weeks in a month.
   - Time spent on TikTok per week: \(210\) minutes.
   
   Therefore, time spent on TikTok per month:
     \[
     210 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 840 \text{ minutes/month}
     \]

3. **Convert minutes into hours for clarity:**
   
   Since there are \(60\) minutes in an hour:
     \[
     \frac{840 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 14 \text{ hours/month}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Britany spends **14** hours on TikTok in a month.<|im_end|>","First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes
Then find how long she spends writing songs in minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes
Then find how long Britany spending doing her makeup in a week: 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = <<15*6=90>>90 minutes/week
Then add the time she spends on videos and song-writing to find the total time she spends on TikTok in a week: 72 minutes/week + 90 minutes/week + 120 minutes/week = <<72+90+120=282>>282 minutes/week
Then multiply the time spent per week by the number of weeks per month to find the total time spent per month: 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = <<282*4=1128>>1128 minutes/month

                    question:
                    An interior design firm offers ; installation ? for $129.00.  ; It includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 ; shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Angela's project will cost, we need to break down the costs based on the given information.

### Step 1: Calculate the base cost for installing the required items.
- **Mirrors**: The base installation fee covers 4 mirrors at $129.00 each.
  \[
  4 \times \$129 = \$516
  \]
  
- **Chandeliers**: The base installation fee covers 1 chandelier at $129.00.
  \[
  1 \times \$129 = \$129
  \]

- **Shelves**: There is no mention of shelves in the provided information; therefore, we assume they are not included in the base installation fee.
  
- **Pictures**: The base installation fee covers 10 pictures at $129.00 each.
  \[
  10 \times \$129 = \$1290
  \]

Now, sum up all these costs to get the total base cost before any additional charges:
\[
\$516 (mirrors) + \$129 (chandeliers) + \$0 (shelves) + \$1290 (pictures) = \$1945
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for installing the extra items.
Angela wants to add 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. Each additional item comes with an extra charge of $15.00.

- **Extra mirrors**:
  \[
  6 \times \$15 = \$90
  \]
  
- **Extra chandeliers**:
  \[
  2 \times \$15 = \$30
  \]
  
- **Extra pictures**:
  \[
  20 \times \$15 = \$300
  \]

Summing these additional charges gives the total extra cost:
\[
\$90 (mirrors) + \$30 (chandeliers) + \$300 (pictures) = \$420
\]

### Step 3: Add the base cost and the additional cost together.
Total cost for Angela’s project:
\[
\$1945 (base cost) + \$420 (extra cost) = \$2365
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total cost for Angela's project is $\boxed{2365}$.<|im_end|>","The service includes 4 mirrors and she has 6 so that's 6-4 = <<6-4=2>>2 extra mirrors

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony.
   - Anthony has saved $10.00.
   - Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Calculate how much money Anthony saved before earning extra for chores:**
   - Let \( A \) be the amount of money Anthony initially saved.
   - According to the problem, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than his initial savings after doing chores.
     So, if \( x \) is the additional money saved from doing chores, then:
     \[
     A + x = 10.00
     \]

3. **Express Roy's total savings in terms of \( x \):**
   - Roy has saved 40% more than what he initially saved (let's call that \( y \)).
     Therefore:
     \[
     y + 0.4y = 1.4y
     \]
     Since Roy saved $10.00 more than Anthony after doing chores, we can set up an equation where Roy's total savings equal Anthony's savings plus the additional money he got from doing chores:
     \[
     y + 0.4y = 10.00
     \]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   1.4y = 10.00
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{10.00}{1.4}
   \]
   \[
   y \approx 7.14
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Roy saved initially without any extra earnings:**
   - Since \( y \) represents the 40% increase on his initial savings, we need to find out how much money was originally saved by dividing \( y \) by 1.4:
     \[
     y_{\text{initial}} = \frac{y}{1.4} = \frac{7.14}{1.4}
     \]
     \[
     y_{\text{initial}} \approx 5.10
     \]

6. **Calculate Roy's total savings including the extra earnings from chores:**
   - Roy's total savings include his initial savings plus the extra $10.00 he earned from doing chores:
     \[
     Total \; Savings_{Roy} = y_{\text{initial}} + 10.00
     \]
     \[
     Total \; Savings_{Roy} \approx 5.10 + 10.00
     \]
     \[
     Total \; Savings_{Roy} \approx 15.10
     \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the height that Naruto can lift a mountain based on the given relationships between the lifting abilities of different individuals.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Pompei's Lifting Ability**:
   - Pompei can lift a mountain that is \(1\) inch tall.
   
2. **Saskay's Lifting Ability**:
   - Saskay can lift a mountain that is \(12\) times taller than Pompei’s mountain.
   - Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain that is \(12 \times 1 = 12\) inches tall.

3. **Kagiyami's Lifting Ability**:
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain that is \(4\) times taller than Saskay’s mountain.
   - Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain that is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) inches tall.

4. **Naruto's Lifting Ability**:
   - Naruto can lift a mountain that is \(10\) times taller than Kagiyami’s mountain.
   - Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain that is \(10 \times 48 = 480\) inches tall.

5. **Converting Inches to Feet**:
   - Since there are \(12\) inches in a foot, we convert the height from inches to feet.
   - \(480\) inches divided by \(12\) equals \(40\) feet.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]<|im_end|>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.

   - He travels for 4 hours.

   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the speed of one kangaroo.
Given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate their combined speed.

- Time taken = 18 hours
- Number of kangaroos = 3

Let \( v \) be the speed of one kangaroo in terms of distance per hour.

Since they cover the entire length of the highway together, the total distance covered by all three kangaroos in 18 hours should equal the total length of the highway.

\[ \text{Total Distance} = v \times (3 \times 18) \]

### Step 2: Calculate the speed of one kangaroo.
We know that the total time for three kangaroos to cover the highway is 18 hours. Therefore, the total distance covered by all three kangaroos in 18 hours equals the total length of the highway.

So,
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54v \]

Now, if we consider only two kangaroos covering the same distance in some unknown time, say \( t_2 \), then we have:
\[ 2v = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{t_2} \]

But since we don't know the value of \( t_2 \), we need to find out the speed of one kangaroo first.

### Step 3: Find the speed of one kangaroo.
From the above equation:
\[ v = \frac{54}{6} \]
where 6 is the number of hours (since 2 kangaroos would cover the distance in \( t_2 \) hours).

Thus,
\[ v = 9 \text{ km/h} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the time it takes for four turtles.
Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Hence, the speed of one turtle is:
\[ \frac{v}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ km/h} \]

If four turtles were to cover the same distance as three kangaroos did in 18 hours, we use the formula for time:
\[ t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

For four turtles:
\[ t_{\text{turtles}} = \frac{54 \times 4.5}{4 \times 9} \]

Simplifying further:
\[ t_{\text{turtles}} = \frac{243}{36} \]
\[ t_{\text{turtles}} = 6.75 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 6.75 hours to cross the highway.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount needed for the new laptop:**
   - The original cost of the new laptop is $600.
   - The discount from trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200.
   \[
   600 - 200 = 400
   \]
   So, after the trade-in, Erika needs $400 more to buy the new laptop.

2. **Calculate the additional amount Erika receives from her parents:**
   - Her mom agrees to give her $80.
   \[
   400 + 80 = 480
   \]

3. **Add the amount Erika received from her part-time job:**
   - She was paid $150 this week.
   \[
   480 + 150 = 630
   \]

4. **Subtract the remaining amount Erika still needs from the total amount available:**
   - Erika now needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.
   \[

                    question:
                    Adam ! wants to eat some : sliced ; apples. A large apple ? can be : sliced ! into ? 5 pieces, ? and a small apple ? can be sliced ! into ; 3 pieces. Adam ! decides to slice 3 large . and ; 5 small apples , and , then eats ; 15 , slices. How ; many ? apple slices are left?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many apple slices Adam cuts from the large apples.
2. Determine how many apple slices Adam cuts from the small apples.
3. Calculate the total number of slices cut.
4. Subtract the total number of slices cut from the initial number of slices.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of slices from large apples
Adam cuts each large apple into 5 pieces. He has 3 large apples, so he will get:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of slices from small apples
Adam cuts each small apple into 3 pieces. He has 5 small apples, so he will get:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices cut
Adding both quantities together gives us the total number of slices cut:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of slices left
Adam originally had 30 slices (since he ate 15 slices). After cutting all the apples, there should be:
\[ 30 \text{ slices initially} - 30 \text{ slices cut} = 0 \text{ slices left} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is:

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Determine daily milk production per cow:**
   - The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk per day from one cow.

2. **Calculate total milk production for all current cows:**
   - He has 3 cows.
   - Total milk produced per day = Milk per cow × Number of cows
   - Total milk produced per day = 5 liters/cow × 3 cows = 15 liters/day

3. **Find out how much milk is needed to meet the target:**
   - The target is 25 liters of milk per day.

4. **Calculate additional milk required:**
   - Additional milk needed = Target milk (per day) - Current milk production
   - Additional milk needed = 25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

5. **Determine how many more cows are needed to achieve the increased milk production:**
   - Each new cow produces 5 liters of milk per day.
   - Number of additional cows needed = Additional milk needed / Milk per cow
   - Number of additional cows needed = 10 liters/day ÷ 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

**Conclusion:** To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs an additional 2 cows.<|im_end|>","He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much glue remains in each stick after it's been partially used and then sum up the lengths of all remaining parts.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Identify the initial length of each glue stick:**
   - Each original glue stick is 12 mm long.

2. **Calculate the remaining length for each partial usage:**
   - For the first stick (1/6 left):
     \[
     \text{Remaining} = 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = 10 \text{ mm}

   - For the second stick (2/3 left):
     \[
     \text{Remaining} = 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ mm}

Total expenses = $10000 + $800 = $10800

**Step 2: Determine current savings**

Gabriel already has:
- Money earned from working on weekends: $5000
- Money given by his brother: $200

Total saved = $5000 + $200 = $5200

**Step 3: Subtract current savings from total expenses**

Money needed = Total expenses - Current savings

Money needed = $10800 - $5200 = $5600

   - Therefore, the total amount of money he has is \(2 \times 20 = \$40\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the squirt guns:**
   - Craig buys six squirt guns at $2 each.
   - The total cost for the squirt guns is \(6 \times 2 = \$12\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the water balloons:**

1. **Identify the relationships between the quantities:**
   - Let \( J_d \) represent the number of dishes Jack collects.
   - Let \( J_s \) represent the number of socks Jack collects.
   - Let \( P_s \) represent the number of socks Peter collects.
   - Let \( P_d \) represent the number of dishes Peter collects.

2. **Given information about Jack's collection:**
   - Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks. So, \( J_d = 2 \times J_s \).
   - Jack collected twice as many socks as dishes. So, \( J_s = 2 \times J_d \).

3. **Using the given value for Jack’s collection (Jack collected 60 dishes):**
   - From \( J_d = 2 \times J_s \), we can substitute \( J_d \) with 60 to find \( J_s \):
     \[
     J_s = \frac{J_d}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Now, we know that Jack collected 30 socks.

4. **Calculate the number of socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. So, \( P_s = 2 \times J_s \):
     \[
     P_s = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of dishes Peter has:**
   - Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. So, \( P_d = \frac{J_d}{2} \):
     \[
     P_d = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

6. **Summarize all the collected items:**
   - Total number of socks: \( P_s + J_s = 60 + 30 = 90 \)
   - Total number of dishes: \( P_d + J_d = 30 + 60 = 90 \)

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. Let's define:

- \( M \) as the set of students who are good at math.
- \( E \) as the set of students who perform well in English.

We know that there are 20 students in total. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. 5 students are good at math only.
2. 8 students perform well in English only.

First, let's determine how many students do not perform well in either subject. Since these two groups (good at math only and perform well in English only) already account for all 13 students, we subtract this from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, there are 7 students who are neither good at math nor perform well in English.

Next, since 5 students are good at math only and 8 students perform well in English only, we add these together to find out how many students are involved in either math or English:

\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \]

These 13 students represent those who are either good at math only, perform well in English only, or both. Therefore, the remaining students must be those who are good at both subjects.

Since there are 7 students who do not participate in either subject, we can now calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects:

\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

This means there are 13 students who are good at both math and English. Since 5 of these students are good at math only, it follows that the remaining students must be those who perform well in English only but also contribute to the count of those who are good at math.

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is:

\[ 13 \]

To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for one performance cycle (including all stages) and then divide that by the available time.

**Step 1: Calculate the time for one performance cycle**

- **Time to get on stage:** 2 minutes
- **Time to perform:** 6 minutes
- **Time to exit stage:** 2 minutes
- **Intermission:** 10 minutes

Total time for one performance cycle = 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes

**Step 2: Determine how many performances fit into the total concert duration**

The concert lasts for 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

Number of performances = Total concert duration / Time per performance cycle

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years based on her investment with simple interest.

Step 1: Determine the annual interest rate.
- The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- Since the original amount is $300, the interest rate is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225 \) dollars per year.

Step 2: Calculate the total interest over 3 years.
- Each year's interest is $225.
- Over 3 years, the total interest will be \( 225 \times 3 = 675 \) dollars.

Step 3: Add the total interest to the principal amount.
- The principal amount is $300.
- Adding the total interest ($675) to the principal gives us the total amount after 3 years.

Let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Total amount after 3 years} = \$300 + \$675 = \$975 \]

                    question:
                    A clothing store has 40 : white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, and 20 of the floral shirts have buttons. How . many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts ? with no collars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the number of white shirts without collars**:
   - Total white shirts: 40
   - Half of these shirts have collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
   - Therefore, the remaining (without collars) are: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

2. **Determine the number of floral shirts with no buttons**:
   - Total floral shirts: 50
   - Given that 20 of them have buttons, the rest must be without buttons.
   - So, the number of floral shirts without buttons is: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

3. **Calculate how many more floral shirts without buttons there are compared to white shirts without collars**:
   - White shirts without collars: 20
   - Floral shirts without buttons: 30
   - Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Therefore, there are **10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars**.

**Final Answer**: The final answer is 10.<|im_end|>","40/2 = <<40/2=20>>20 white shirts have no collars.
50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30 floral shirts have no buttons.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many trays the farmer needs:**
   - The total number of eggs is 900.
   - Each tray can hold 30 eggs.
   - To find out how many trays are needed, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of one tray.
     \[
     \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Capacity of one tray}} = \frac{900}{30}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of trays} = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling all the trays:**
   - The farmer sells each tray for $2.5.
   - Since there are 30 trays, we multiply the price per tray by the number of trays.
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Price per tray} \times \text{Number of trays} = \$2.5 \times 30

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many goats were removed from each farm.
- From Farm X: Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y: Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats as he did from Farm X. Therefore, he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of goats remaining on each farm after sales.
- On Farm X: 
  - Initial goats: 55
  - Sold goats: 10
  - Remaining goats: \(55 - 10 = 45\)

- On Farm Y:
  - Initial goats: 45
  - Sold goats: 20
  - Remaining goats: \(45 - 20 = 25\)

### Step 3: Add the remaining goats together to find the total.
- Total remaining goats:
  - Farm X: 45 goats
  - Farm Y: 25 goats
  - Total: \(45 + 25 = 70\)

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 70 goats.<|im_end|>","There are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of months in a year:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.

2. **Determine the total amount spent on shoes per year:**
   - James spends $2640 annually.

3. **Find out how many pairs of shoes James buys each year:**
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes every month.
   - Therefore, the number of pairs he buys per year is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) pairs.

4. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes:**
   - To find the average cost per pair of shoes, divide the total annual spending by the number of pairs bought per year.
     \[
     \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\$2640}{24}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost per basket of green food.
2. Determine the cost per basket of red food.
3. Calculate the total cost for buying 3 baskets of green food.
4. Calculate the total cost for buying ""x"" baskets of red food (where x = 3 + some number).
5. Apply the discount on the total cost of the red food.

### Step 1: Cost per basket of green food
Given that one basket of green food costs $25, we can determine the cost per basket as follows:
\[ \text{Cost per basket} = \$25 \]

### Step 2: Cost per basket of red food
Given that one basket of red food costs $18, we can determine the cost per basket as follows:
\[ \text{Cost per basket of red food} = \$18 \]

### Step 3: Total cost for 3 baskets of green food
Since one basket of green food costs $25, the cost for 3 baskets of green food would be:
\[ \text{Total cost for 3 baskets of green food} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75 \]

### Step 4: Total cost for ""x"" baskets of red food
We don't know exactly how many baskets of red food are needed yet, but let's denote it as \( x \). The total cost before applying any discounts would be:
\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = x \times \$18 \]

### Step 5: Applying the discount on the total cost of the red food
If there is a discount of $2 off for each basket of red food, then after applying the discount, the cost for \( x \) baskets of red food would be:
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = (x - 3) \times \$16 \]
This formula assumes that the discount applies only to the extra red food beyond three baskets.

However, since the problem does not specify what \( x \) should be, we cannot calculate an exact total without knowing more about the quantity of red food purchased. Therefore, the final answer depends on the value of \( x \).

For example, if \( x = 5 \), then the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost after discount} = (5 - 3) \times \$16 = 2 \times \$16 = \$32 \]

So, the final answer is dependent on the value of \( x \). If \( x = 5 \), the total amount to be paid would be $32. If additional information was provided regarding the number of red food baskets purchased, the calculation could be completed accordingly.<|im_end|>","The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.

So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

   - The total number of rooms is 90.
   - We need to find out how many rooms will be cleaned if only half of them are cleaned.

\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{\text{Total number of rooms}}{2} \]

\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} \]

\[ \text{Number of rooms to clean} = 45 \]

2. **Determine the time required to clean these rooms:**
   - Housekeeping takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

Since we need to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time taken per room:

\[ \text{Time to clean 45 rooms} = 45 \times 20 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.

First, convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total minutes}}{60} \]

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{45 \times 20}{60} \]

4. **Simplify the calculation:**

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900}{60} \]

\[ \text{Total time in hours} = 15 \]

Therefore, it would take **15 hours** to clean one-half of the rooms.<|im_end|>","90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of homes built over the next three years based on the given information.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of homes built in the first year**
- The first year, they plan to build **12 homes**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of homes built in the second year**
- According to the instructions, they will build three times as many homes as they did in the first year.
- Therefore, for the second year, they will build **3 * 12 = 36 homes**.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of homes built in the third year**
- For the third year, they will build twice the amount that was built in the second year.
- So, for the third year, they will build **2 * 36 = 72 homes**.

**Step 4: Sum up all the homes built over the three years**
- Total number of homes built = Homes in the first year + Homes in the second year + Homes in the third year.
- Total number of homes built = **12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 72 (third year)**.

Let's add these numbers together:

- **Total = 12 + 36 + 72 = 120**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as my current age.
- \( y \) as my brother's current age.
- \( z \) as my sister's current age.
- \( m \) as my mother's current age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
\[ x = y - 3 \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
\[ x = z + 2 \]

3. My mother's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
\[ m = 3y - 1 \]

4. The sum of our ages is 87:
\[ x + y + z + m = 87 \]

We now have four equations:
1. \( x = y - 3 \)
2. \( x = z + 2 \)
3. \( m = 3y - 1 \)
4. \( x + y + z + m = 87 \)

First, let's substitute \( x \) from equation (1) into equations (2), (3), and (4):

For equation (2):
\[ y - 3 = z + 2 \]
Solving for \( z \):
\[ y - 5 = z \]
So,
\[ z = y - 5 \]

For equation (3):
\[ m = 3(y - 3) - 1 \]
Expanding:
\[ m = 3y - 9 - 1 \]
\[ m = 3y - 10 \]

Now, substitute \( x \) and \( m \) from equations (1) and (3) into equation (4):
\[ x + y + z + m = 87 \]
Substituting \( x \) and \( m \):
\[ (y - 3) + y + (y - 5) + (3y - 10) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ y - 3 + y + y - 5 + 3y - 10 = 87 \]
\[ 6y - 18 = 87 \]
Add 18 to both sides:
\[ 6y = 105 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ y = 17.5 \]

Since ages must be whole numbers, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given conditions or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate if any additional context or constraints might be missing.

Given the consistent setup and calculations, if we assume no errors in arithmetic but still find non-whole number ages, it indicates potential issues in the initial conditions or data. Therefore, the solution does not fit typical whole number age scenarios unless revisiting input details.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{17.5}

<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many glue sticks are needed:**
   - There are 27 students.
   - Each student needs 2 glue sticks.
   - Therefore, total glue sticks required = \( 27 \times 2 = 54 \) glue sticks.

2. **Calculate the number of packs needed:**
   - Each pack contains 8 glue sticks.
   - We divide the total number of glue sticks (54) by the number of glue sticks per pack (8).
   
   \[
   \frac{54}{8} = 6.75
   \]
   
   Since you can't purchase a fraction of a pack, we round up to the next whole number because even one student would require an additional pack for any leftover glue stick count.

3. **Check if Mr. Jackson needs more than one full pack:**
   - If he buys 6 packs, that gives him \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) glue sticks.
   - With 48 glue sticks, there would be \( 54 - 48 = 6 \) extra glue sticks remaining.
   - However, since he wants every student to get exactly 2 glue sticks, and 6 extra glue sticks won't be enough for all students.

Therefore, he needs at least 7 packs to ensure each student gets 2 glue sticks, considering he might have some extra leftover after using them for everyone.

**Final Answer:** Mr. Jackson needs to buy **7 packs** of glue sticks.<|im_end|>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.
Divide the number of glue sticks by the amount in each pack, 54 / 8 = <<54/8=6.75>>6.75 packs.
Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

1. **Initial Volume Calculation:**
   - At the start (before any rain), the river passes through 4000 gallons of water per unit time.
   
2. **Volume Increase Due to Heavy Rain:**
   - After a certain number of days of heavy rain, the flow doubles. So if it doubles, the new flow rate will be \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons per unit time.

3. **Third Day Flow Rate:**
   - On the third day, the flow rate increases by an additional 6000 gallons. Therefore, the flow rate on the third day will be \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons per unit time.

Now, let's sum up these volumes:

- First day flow: \(4000\) gallons
- Second day flow: \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons
- Third day flow: \(4000 \times 2 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons

Summing these values gives us the total amount of water passing through the river over those three days.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of infected individuals after three days, given that each infected person infects six others every day.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Day 1:
- **Initial Infected**: There is 1 infected person on the first day.
- **New Infections**: Each infected person infects 6 others.
- **Total New Infections**: \(1 \times 6 = 6\)
- **Total Infected After Day 1**: Initial + New Infections = \(1 + 6 = 7\)

### Day 2:
- **Infected from Day 1**: The initial 1 person remains infected.
- **New Infections**: Each infected person (now 7) infects 6 others.
- **Total New Infections**: \(7 \times 6 = 42\)
- **Total Infected After Day 2**: Infected from Day 1 + New Infections = \(1 + 42 = 43\)

### Day 3:
- **Infected from Day 2**: The 1 person from Day 1 remains infected.
- **New Infections**: Each infected person (now 43) infects 6 others.
- **Total New Infections**: \(43 \times 6 = 258\)
- **Total Infected After Day 3**: Infected from Day 2 + New Infections = \(1 + 258 = 259\)

So, after three days, there will be 259 infected individuals. 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
{The final answer is} 259.<|im_end|>","On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.

On the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.
There are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.
On the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.

   - Each customer gives a tip of $20.
   - There were 40 customers.

   \[
   \text{Total tips from Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much money Julieta received:**
   - Julieta received 10% less in tips than Rafaela.
   
   Since Rafaela received $800 in tips, Julieta's share would be:

   \[
   \text{Julieta's tips} = 800 \times (1 - 0.10) = 800 \times 0.90 = 720 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Sum up the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:**

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many badges Claire earns per month.
Claire earns 1 badge per month.

### Step 2: Calculate how many badges Amber earns per month.
Since Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, she will take two months to earn one badge.

- **Amber’s badges per month**: \( \frac{1}{2} \) or 0.5 badges per month.

### Step 3: Calculate how many badges Wendy earns per month.
Wendy earns three times the number of badges that Claire earns in the same period.

- **Wendy’s badges per month**: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) badges per month.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of badges each person earns over a 1-year period (12 months).
For Claire:
\[ \text{Total badges for Claire} = 12 \]

For Amber:
\[ \text{Total badges for Amber} = 0.5 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total badges for Amber} = 6 \]

For Wendy:
\[ \text{Total badges for Wendy} = 3 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total badges for Wendy} = 36 \]

### Step 5: Determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber.
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total badges for Wendy} - \text{Total badges for Amber} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 36 - 6 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a 1-year time frame.<|im_end|>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. Determine how many hours Paige bakes.
2. Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Find out how many slices are produced from those loaves.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the slices.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Determine how many hours Paige bakes
Paige bakes every hour from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. So, she bakes for 5 hours (from 1 to 6).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of banana bread loaves baked
Since Paige bakes 2 loaves per hour, over 5 hours she will bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

### Step 3: Find out how many slices are produced from those loaves
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling the slices
Each slice is sold for $0.50, so the total revenue is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times \$0.50/\text{slice} = \$40 \]

Therefore, if Paige sold all the slices, she would raise $40 in dollars.

The final answer is: The final answer is $\boxed{40}$<|im_end|>","From 1pm - 6pm, there are 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     G = S + 30
     \]
   - We also know that if Gretchen had 70 gold coins, then her total coin count would be the sum of gold and silver coins. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     G + S = 70
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve for One Variable:**
   - From the first equation, substitute \( G \) into the second equation:
     \[
     (S + 30) + S = 70
     \]
   - Simplify and combine like terms:
     \[
     2S + 30 = 70
     \]
   - Subtract 30 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
     \[
     2S = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = 20
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Gold Coins:**
   - Substitute \( S = 20 \) back into the equation \( G = S + 30 \):
     \[
     G = 20 + 30
     \]
   - Calculate the value of \( G \):
     \[
     G = 50
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Coins:**
   - Now we know Gretchen has 50 gold coins and 20 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, add these together:
     \[
     G + S = 50 + 20 = 70
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, Gretchen has a total of 70 coins.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{70}\).<|im_end|>","Gretchen has 70-30=<<70-30=40>>40 silver coins.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow cars on the bumper car rink. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cars.
We know there are 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars.

\[ \text{Number of green cars} = \text{Number of red cars} - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 10 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of blue cars.
There are 3 times the number of green cars as blue cars.

\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Number of green cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 3 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = 30 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of red, green, and blue cars.
Now that we have the number of each color car, let's add them together to find out how many cars are accounted for.

\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 12 (\text{red}) + 10 (\text{green}) + 30 (\text{blue}) \]
\[ \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} = 52 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.
Given that the total number of cars on the rink is 75, we can now calculate the number of yellow cars by subtracting the sum of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars.

\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - \text{Total number of red, green, and blue cars} \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 75 - 52 \]
\[ \text{Number of yellow cars} = 23 \]

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of books Fawn has.

Let's denote the number of books that Anne, Sofie, and Fawn have as \( A \), \( S \), and \( F \) respectively.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The total number of books is 85: 
\[ A + S + F = 85 \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
\[ S = A + 25 \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
\[ A = F - 12 \]

Now let's use these equations to find out how many books Fawn has.

First, substitute \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[ A + (A + 25) + F = 85 \]
\[ 2A + 25 + F = 85 \]
Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[ 2A + F = 60 \]

Next, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the above equation:
\[ A = F - 12 \]
So,
\[ 2(F - 12) + F = 60 \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 2F - 24 + F = 60 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3F - 24 = 60 \]
Add 24 to both sides:
\[ 3F = 84 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ F = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books.<|im_end|>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Greg will spend on the jello, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of small jello cups needed.
2. Determine the cost per cup based on the price given.
3. Multiply the number of cups needed by the cost per cup to find the total amount spent.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of small jello cups needed:**
   - There are 30 kids at the party.
   - Each kid should get 4 cups.
   - Total number of cups = \(30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups/kid} = 120 \text{ cups}\).

2. **Determine the cost per cup:**
   - The price of one box (which contains 10 cups) is $1.25.
   - Therefore, the cost per cup = \(\frac{1.25}{10} = 0.125\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Number of cups needed = 120.
   - Cost per cup = $0.125.
   - Total amount spent = \(120 \times 0.125 = 15\) dollars.

So, Greg will spend $15 on the jello. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{15}$<|im_end|>","There will be 30 kids and he wants each kid to have 4 servings so that's 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 jello cups

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the phones:**
   - The electronics store bought 5 phones.
   - Each phone costs $700.
   - Total cost = Number of phones × Cost per phone
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 700 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount given to the seller:**
   - The seller gave $4000 in dollar bills.

3. **Calculate the change received from the buyer:**
   - The change received is the difference between what was given ($4000) and the total cost ($3500).
   \[
   \text{Change received} = 4000 - 3500 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{500}$<|im_end|>","The seller bought the 5 phones for $700 * 5 = $<<700*5=3500>>3500.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total monthly grocery spending:**
   - The total monthly grocery spending is given as \$400.

2. **Calculate the weekly grocery spending:**
   - Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how much they spend together each week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly spending} = \frac{\$400}{4} = \$100
   \]

3. **Determine Madeline's contribution to the weekly grocery spending:**
   - Madeline pays 60% of the cost for groceries.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's contribution} = 0.60 \times \$100 = \$60
   \]

4. **Calculate Keenan's contribution to the weekly grocery spending:**
   - Since the remaining amount (40%) that Keenan pays comes from their combined effort, we subtract Madeline's contribution from the total weekly spending.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's contribution} = \$100 - \$60 = \$40

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many pieces Tobias eats on each day.
- On the first day, Tobias eats \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of pieces. Since there are 60 pieces in total, he eats:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

- On the second day, Tobias eats 10 pieces.

- On the third day, Tobias eats \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces after the first two days.

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining pieces after each day.
- After the first day, the remaining pieces are:
\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

- After the second day, the remaining pieces are:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

- After the third day, the remaining pieces are:
\[ 26 \times \left(1 - \frac{7}{13}\right) = 26 \times \left(\frac{6}{13}\right) = 26 \times \frac{6}{13} = 12 \text{ pieces} \]

### Step 3: Sum up the pieces Tobias has eaten over the three days.
- The total number of pieces eaten is:
\[ 24 + 10 + 12 = 46 \text{ pieces} \]

### Conclusion:
Tobias has eaten a total of 46 pieces from the pizza.

The final answer is: The final answer is 46.<|im_end|>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per bottle for both soda and water first.

### Step 1: Determine the price per bottle for soda.
We know that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00. To find out the cost per bottle of soda, divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of soda} = \frac{\$21.00}{7} = \$3.00
\]

So, each bottle of soda costs $3.00.

### Step 2: Determine the price per bottle for water.
We know that four bottles of water cost $8.00. To find out the cost per bottle of water, divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of water} = \frac{\$8.00}{4} = \$2.00
\]

So, each bottle of water also costs $2.00.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for soda.
David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda. Since each bottle costs $3.00, the total cost for the soda is:

\[
\text{Total cost for soda} = 3 \times \$3.00 = \$9.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for water.
David wants to buy 2 bottles of water. Since each bottle costs $2.00, the total cost for the water is:

\[
\text{Total cost for water} = 2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00
\]

### Step 5: Add up the total costs.
Finally, add the cost of the soda and the cost of the water together to get the total amount David will spend:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$9.00 + \$4.00 = \$13.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for David's purchase is:

\[
\boxed{13.00}
\]<|im_end|>","One bottle of soda costs $21.00/7 = $<<21/7=3.00>>3.00.

One bottle of water costs $8.00/4 = $<<8/4=2.00>>2.00.
Two bottles of water cost $2.00x 2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bolts**
- We know that each bolt costs $0.03.
- David wants to buy 16 bolts.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bolts} \times \text{Cost per bolt}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 0.48
\]

So far, David spent $0.48 on the bolts.

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from his initial amount of money**

David started with $12.48.

\[
\text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
\]

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48
\]

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.00
\]

Therefore, after buying the bolts, David will have $12.00 left.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 12.00.<|im_end|>","David paid 16 * 0.03 = $<<16*0.03=0.48>>0.48 for the bolts.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Ella's hourly wage first, then use that information to find out how much she would earn in 12 hours.

Step 1: Calculate Ella's hourly wage.
Ella worked 3 hours for $33. Therefore, her hourly wage can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Number of Hours}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Hourly Wage} = \frac{33}{3} = 11
\]

So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

Step 2: Calculate how much Ella would earn in 12 hours.
Now that we know her hourly wage, we can calculate how much she would earn if she works for 12 hours.

\[
\text{Earnings in 12 Hours} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Earnings in 12 Hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul had after receiving more from his friend**

Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more marbles.

\[ \text{Total marbles} = 52 + 28 \]

Let's perform the addition:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

So, after receiving the marbles from his friend, Paul has **80 marbles** in total.

**Step 2: Determine how many marbles Paul loses**

Paul then loses \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his total marbles.

\[ \text{Marbles lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \]

Now let's calculate the amount of marbles lost:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

So, Paul loses **20 marbles**.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of marbles Paul has left**

Subtract the number of marbles lost from the total number of marbles Paul originally had.

\[ \text{Marbles left} = 80 - 20 \]

Perform the subtraction:

   - Number of correct answers = \( 0.8 \times 10 = 8 \)
   - Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
   - Total points from multiple-choice questions = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \)

2. **Calculate Points for True/False Questions:**
   - Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions.
   - Number of correct answers = \( 0.9 \times 20 = 18 \)
   - Each true/false question is worth 1 point (since it's not specified otherwise).

   - Each long-answer question is worth 5 points.
   - Total points from long-answer questions = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

4. **Sum Up All Points:**
   - Total points scored = Points from multiple-choice + Points from true/false + Points from long-answer
   - Total points scored = \( 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of points Amy scores is \(\boxed{41}\).<|im_end|>","First find the number of multiple-choice questions Amy gets right: 80% * 10 questions = <<80*.01*10=8>>8 questions

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell:**
   - Isaias has 300 chickens.
   - He plans to sell \(\frac{3}{5}\) of them.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \left( \frac{3}{5} \right) \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling these chickens:**
   - Each chicken sells for $50.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = \$9000
\]

3. **Determine the amount Isaias needs to make a profit of $2000:**
   - Total revenue ($9000) should cover both cost and profit.

4. **Identify the cost of purchasing the chickens:**
   - Let \(C\) be the total cost of buying the chickens.

5. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - C
\]

Given that the profit is $2000:

\[
2000 = 9000 - C
\]

6. **Solve for \(C\):**

\[
C = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

                    question:
                    ? Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade at their : lemonade stand. : Julie sold 14 ! glasses and the boys sold an equal number ? of glasses. How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more glasses Julie sold compared to Micah, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses sold by the boys**
- The total number of glasses sold by all three individuals is 32.
- Julie sold 14 glasses.
- Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as \( M \).

Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, we can set up the equation:
\[ 14 + M = \text{Total Glasses Sold by Boys} \]

From this, we know that:
\[ 14 + M = 32 \]

**Step 2: Solve for \( M \)**
Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ M = 32 - 14 \]
\[ M = 18 \]

So, Micah sold 18 glasses.

**Step 3: Determine how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah**
Julie sold 14 glasses, and Micah sold 18 glasses. To find out how many more glasses Julie sold, subtract Micah’s sales from Julie’s sales:
\[ 14 - 18 = -4 \]

This result indicates that Micah actually sold 4 more glasses than Julie. Therefore, Julie sold fewer glasses than Micah.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{Micah sold 4 more glasses than Julie}}
\]<|im_end|>","Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses.
They each sold 18/2 = <<18/2=9>>9 glasses.

                    question:
                    At a spa, Iris spent ? $400 to do her : hair, 1/4 , as ? much . to do a ! manicure, and ; 3/4 as : much . money as a : manicure to do a : pedicure. How much money did she spend at , the spa?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the manicure.
- Iris spends ?$400 for her hair treatment.
- The hair treatment costs 1/4 of what she spends on a manicure.

Let \( M \) represent the amount of money Iris spends on a manicure.

Given that the hair treatment costs 1/4 of the manicure, we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{4}M = \$400 \]

To find \( M \), we multiply both sides by 4:
\[ M = \$400 \times 4 \]
\[ M = \$1600 \]

So, Iris spends $1600 on a manicure.

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the pedicure.
- The pedicure costs 3/4 of the manicure.

Let \( P \) represent the amount of money Iris spends on a pedicure.

Given that the pedicure costs 3/4 of the manicure, we can write:
\[ \frac{3}{4}P = \text{pedicure cost} \]

Since \( P = \$1600 \):
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times \$1600 = \$1200 \]

So, Iris spends $1200 on a pedicure.

### Step 3: Calculate the total spending at the spa.
- Total spending = Cost of hair + Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure

Substituting the values found in Steps 1 and 2:
\[ \text{Total Spending} = \$400 + \$1600 + \$1200 \]
\[ \text{Total Spending} = \$2200 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{\$2200}$<|im_end|>","The total amount of money that Iris used to do a manicure is 1/4*$400 = $<<1/4*400=100>>100

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the original rope.
2. Determine how many meters of the original rope Sarah can sell.
3. Calculate the amount of money Sarah makes from selling the original rope.
4. Subtract this amount from her initial investment in the new rope to find out how much money she'll have left.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the original rope

- The original rope is 20 meters long.
- It sells for $2 per meter.
- Therefore, the total cost of the original rope is \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

### Step 2: Determine how many meters of the original rope Sarah can sell

- She sells it for $2 per meter.
- Let's assume she decides to sell all or part of it.

For simplicity, let's say she sells all of it (as if she doesn't know how much she still needs). So, she sells 20 meters.

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Sarah makes from selling the original rope

- Selling 20 meters at $2 per meter gives her \(20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter} = \$40\).

### Step 4: Subtract the amount made from selling the original rope from her initial investment in the new rope

- Sarah initially invested $40 on the original rope.
- She made another $40 from selling the original rope.
- After buying the new rope, she has no more money left.

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is $0.

<|im_start|>user

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    In 10 , years, Melanie ? will ? be 18 . years : old. In ! how many years will her age be thrice her ? present ! age?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine when Melanie's age will be three times her current age.

Step 1: Determine Melanie's current age.
Given that in 10 years she will be 18 years old, we can calculate her current age as follows:
\[ \text{Current Age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \]

Step 2: Set up an equation for her future age being three times her current age.
Let \( x \) represent the number of years from now until her age is tripled. Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 3 \times (8 + x) \). We set this equal to three times her current age:
\[ 3 \times (8 + x) = 3 \times (8 + x) \]

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
We already know that her current age is 8, so let’s substitute it into the equation:
\[ 3 \times (8 + x) = 3 \times (8 + x) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 3(8 + x) = 3(8 + x) \]

Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
Since both sides of the equation are identical, there is no specific value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation directly because the equation itself does not provide a unique solution for \( x \). This suggests that we may have made assumptions or calculations that led us astray. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

Re-evaluation:
Upon reflection, if Melanie's age triples every year, then after \( n \) years, her age will be:
\[ A(n) = A_0 + nA \]
where \( A_0 \) is her initial age, \( n \) is the number of years, and \( A \) is the annual increase per unit time. Given her initial age \( A_0 = 8 \), her age after \( n \) years should satisfy:
\[ 8 + nx = 3 \times 8 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ 8 + nx = 24 \]
\[ nx = 16 \]
\[ n = \frac{16}{x} \]

Given the context of the problem, where we're looking at a single instance rather than continuous growth over multiple years, we must consider the possibility that her age might be tripled once within the given period. Assuming her age doubles every two years instead:

Step 5: Re-calculate based on doubling.
If her age doubles every two years, we would have:
\[ 8 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 128 \rightarrow 256 \rightarrow 512 \rightarrow 1024 \]
After 10 years, her age would be:
\[ 1024 \]

Step 6: Calculate the total number of years.
From the previous calculation, her age after 10 years is:
\[ 1024 \]

Therefore, her age will be three times her current age after:
\[ \boxed{10} \] years.<|im_end|>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.
Thrice Melanie's present age is 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24.
So, she will be thrice her present age in 24 - 8 = 16 years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per unit of bacon:**
   - Kelly's bacon costs $10 for 5 packs.
   - Therefore, the cost per pack of bacon = $\frac{10}{5} = $2$.

2. **Determine the number of chicken packets and their cost:**
   - Kelly has 6 packs of chicken.
   - Each chicken packet costs twice as much as a bacon pack.
   - Since one pack of bacon costs $2$, one pack of chicken costs $2 \times 2 = $4$.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all chicken packs = $4 \times 6 = $24$.

3. **Calculate the cost of strawberries:**
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries.
   - Each strawberry pack costs $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all strawberry packs = $4 \times 3 = $12$.

4. **Calculate the cost of apples:**
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples.
   - The price of an apple pack is half that of a strawberry pack, so each apple pack costs $\frac{4}{2} = $2$.
   - Therefore, the total cost for all apple packs = $2 \times 7 = $14$.

5. **Sum up all the costs:**
   - Total cost for bacon = $10$
   - Total cost for chicken = $24$
   - Total cost for strawberries = $12$
   - Total cost for apples = $14$
   - Therefore, the total cost for all items = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60$.

6. **Subtract the total cost from Kelly's budget:**
   - Kelly's budget is $65.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount in her budget = $65 - $60 = $5$.

**Final Answer:** Kelly has $5 left in her budget.<|im_end|>","Each pack of bacon costs Kelly $10 total / 5 packs of bacon = $<<10/5=2>>2.
So each pack of chicken costs $2 per pack of bacon * 2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.
All of the chicken will therefore cost 6 packets of chicken * $4 per pack of chicken = $<<6*4=24>>24.
The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.
She therefore has $65 budget - $60 for shopping = $<<65-60=5>>5 left in the budget.

To determine the length of Elaina's usual concert, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the duration (in minutes) of Elaina's usual concert.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
According to the information given, the final concert lasts twice as long as her usual concert. Therefore, the runtime of the final concert can be expressed as:
\[ 2x \]

We are also informed that the final concert is 65 minutes long:
\[ 2x = 65 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, solve for \( x \):
\[
2x = 65 \\
x = \frac{65}{2} \\
x = 32.5

1. **Total Microphones**: The singer initially has 50 microphones.

2. **Microphones Not Arranged**: He realizes that 20% of these microphones won't find any space to fit into pairs. 
   - Calculate 20% of 50 microphones.
     \[

1. **Number of birds nesting**: Jerry counts 6 birds nesting.
   
2. **Birds flying overhead**:
   - We know that 2/3 of the nesting birds are flying overhead.
   - Let \( B \) represent the total number of birds flying overhead.
   - According to the given information, \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = B \).

Now let’s calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 birds flying overhead.

3. **Birds grouped together for feeding**:
   - There are 3 groups of 8 birds each.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds in these groups is \( 3 \times 8 \).

Calculating this:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, there are 24 birds grouped together for feeding.

Finally, we add up all the birds mentioned:

- Nesting birds: 6
- Birds flying overhead: 4
- Birds grouped together for feeding: 24

Total number of birds:

\[ 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 \]

Therefore, Jerry counts a total of **34 birds**. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 34 birds.<|im_end|>","First find how many birds are flying overhead: 6 birds * 2/3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 birds
Then find how many birds are feeding: 3 groups * 8 birds/group = <<3*8=24>>24 birds
Then add the number of nesting birds and flying birds to find the total number of birds: 4 birds + 24 birds + 6 birds = <<4+24+6=34>>34 birds

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of petals for the orchids.
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.

\[
\text{Total petals for orchids} = \text{Number of orchids} \times \text{Petals per orchid}
\]
\[
\text{Total petals for orchids} = 5 \times 5 = 25
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of petals for the African daisies.
- Joelle has : 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.

\[
\text{Total petals for daisies} = \text{Number of daisies} \times \text{Petals per daisy}
\]
\[
\text{Total petals for daisies} = 4 \times 10 = 40

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - Total number of plants = 100
   - Fraction of plants that are indoor = 1/4
   - Number of indoor plants = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 100 \)

2. **Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total to find the number of remaining plants:**
   - Remaining plants after removing indoor ones = Total - Indoor plants

3. **Calculate the fraction of remaining plants that are outdoor:**
   - Fraction of remaining plants that are outdoor = 2/3 (since two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor)
   
4. **Subtract the number of outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find the number of flowering plants:**
   - Number of flowering plants = Remaining plants - Outdoor plants
   
5. **Find the percentage of plants that are flowering:**
   - Percentage of flowering plants = \( \left( \frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}} \right) \times 100 \)

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of indoor plants
\[ \text{Indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the number of indoor plants from the total to find the number of remaining plants
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of remaining plants that are outdoor
\[ \text{Fraction of remaining plants that are outdoor} = \frac{2}{3} \]

### Step 4: Find the number of outdoor plants
\[ \text{Outdoor plants} = 75 \times \frac{2}{3} = 50 \]

### Step 5: Find the number of flowering plants
\[ \text{Flowering plants} = 75 - 50 = 25 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the percentage of plants that are flowering
\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the whirligig based on the information given about the other spinning objects. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between speeds
- The whirligig spins five times faster than the thingamabob.
- The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than the thingamabob.

### Step 2: Determine the relative speeds
Let \( V_{thingamabob} \) be the speed of the thingamabob in meters per second (m/s).
- Since the whirligig spins five times faster, its speed \( V_{whirligig} \) can be expressed as:
\[ V_{whirligig} = 5 \times V_{thingamabob} \]

Similarly,
- The whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster, so its speed \( V_{whatchamacallit} \) can be expressed as:
\[ V_{whatchamacallit} = 11 \times V_{thingamabob} \]

### Step 3: Use the given speed of the whatchamacallit
We know that the whatchamacallit spins at 121 m/s. So, we can set up an equation using this information:
\[ V_{whatchamacallit} = 121 \text{ m/s} \]
Substitute \( V_{whatchamacallit} \) into the expression for the whatchamacallit’s speed:
\[ 121 = 11 \times V_{thingamabob} \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( V_{thingamabob} \)
Divide both sides of the equation by 11 to find the speed of the thingamabob:
\[ V_{thingamabob} = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the speed of the whirligig
Now that we have the speed of the thingamabob, we can use it to find the speed of the whirligig:
\[ V_{whirligig} = 5 \times V_{thingamabob} \]
\[ V_{whirligig} = 5 \times 11 \text{ m/s} \]
\[ V_{whirligig} = 55 \text{ m/s} \]

Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is **55 m/s**.<|im_end|>","A thingamabob spins 1/11 as fast as a whatchamacallit, so it spins at 121 / 11 = 11 meters per second.
A whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = <<11*5=55>>55 meters per second.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one carrot based on the information provided about the prices of other items.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the yogurt
We know that the yogurt is half the price of the salad.
- Cost of the salad = $6
- Therefore, the cost of the yogurt = $6 / 2 = $3

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt per day
- Total cost of salad and yogurt per day = $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) = $9

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the salad and yogurt from the overall daily budget
- Overall daily budget = $11
- Daily budget spent on salad and yogurt = $9
- Therefore, the remaining amount spent on carrots per day = $11 - $9 = $2

### Step 4: Determine the number of carrots eaten per day
- Ellen eats 2 carrots per day

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of one carrot
- Since the total cost of carrots per day is $2 and there are 2 carrots,
- Cost of one carrot = $2 / 2 = $1

Therefore, Ellen pays **$1** for one carrot every day.<|im_end|>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.
For the two carrots Ellen needs to pay $11 - $6 - $3 = $<<11-6-3=2>>2.
So one carrot costs $2 / $2 = $<<2/2=1>>1.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate how many hours Mark worked in one week
Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
\[ \text{Total hours per week} = 8 \times 5 \]

Let's do the multiplication first:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
So, Mark works 40 hours in one week.

### Step 2: Determine Mark's original hourly wage before the raise
We know that Mark originally made $10 per hour. Let's verify if this is correct using his weekly working hours:
\[ \text{Original weekly earnings} = 40 \times 10 \]

Again, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 40 \times 10 = 400 \]
This means Mark was supposed to earn $400 in total from his regular work in one week. This calculation confirms our understanding of his initial earning structure.

### Step 3: Calculate the new hourly wage after the raise
The company raised Mark’s pay by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly rate will be:
\[ \text{New hourly wage} = 10 + 2 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \]
So, Mark now earns $12 per hour.

### Step 4: Calculate Mark's new weekly earnings
With the increased hourly wage, we can find out how much Mark makes in a week:
\[ \text{New weekly earnings} = 40 \times 12 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 40 \times 12 = 480 \]
Thus, Mark now makes $480 in a week.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total earnings:**
   - Total earnings = $80 (from both jobs)

2. **Determine the number of weeks involved:**
   - We need to find out how many weeks were involved in these transactions.
   
3. **Calculate the amount earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of weeks where Tasha worked on lawns.
   - From the information given, we know that in the first week, she mowed Kamala’s lawn three times as many times as she mowed Joe’s lawn. This means she mowed Joe’s lawn once per week, while she mowed Kamala’s lawn 3 times per week.
   - Therefore, in one week, she mowed Kamala’s lawn 3x times and Joe’s lawn x times.
   - In total, she mowed 4x lawns (since \( 3x + x = 4x \)).
   
4. **Calculate the amount earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Since she earns $15 per hour and spends 2 hours mowing each lawn, her hourly wage is $7.50 (since \( \$15 / 2 = \$7.50 \)).
   - For the first week, she earned \( 4x \times 7.50 \).
   - For the second week, she earned \( 5x \times 7.50 \).

5. **Sum up the earnings from both jobs:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from lawns + Earnings from lemonade sales
   - $80 = \( 4x \times 7.50 + 5x \times 7.50 \)
   - Simplifying, we get \( 80 = 30x + 37.50x \)
   - Combining like terms gives us \( 80 = 67.50x \)
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 1.18 \) (rounded to two decimal places).

6. **Calculate the amount earned from lemonade sales:**
   - She makes $80 in total.
   - Subtracting the earnings from lawns, we get \( 80 - (30 \times 1.18 + 5 \times 1.18) \).

Let's do the calculations:

- Lawns: \( 4 \times 1.18 = 4.72 \) (approximately)
- Lemonade: \( 80 - 4.72 = 75.28 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $75.28.<|im_end|>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars

Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine Carl's weight
Given that Martin's weight is \(55\) kg, we can find Carl's weight by adding \(16\) kg to Martin's weight.
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \]
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 + 16 \]

### Calculation for Carl's weight:
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 71 \text{ kg} \]

### Step 2: Determine Christian's weight
Next, we calculate Christian's weight by adding \(8\) kg to Carl's weight.
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = \text{Carl's weight} + 8 \]
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 + 8 \]

### Calculation for Christian's weight:
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} \]

### Step 3: Determine Harry's weight
Finally, we determine Harry's weight by subtracting \(5\) kg from Christian's weight.
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \]
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 - 5 \]

### Calculation for Harry's weight:
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 74 \text{ kg} \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the weight of Harry is \(74\) kg.

<|im_start|>user

To calculate John's profit from renting his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rental periods:**
   - John rents his car out 10 times per month.
   
2. **Determine the total duration of all rentals:**
   - Each rental lasts for 3 hours.
   - Total duration = Number of rentals × Duration per rental
   
\[
\text{Total duration} = 10 \times 3 \text{ hours}
\]

3. **Convert the total duration into days (assuming 24 hours in a day):**
   - To do this, divide the total hours by 24.

\[
\text{Total days} = \frac{\text{Total duration}}{24}
\]

4. **Calculate the total earnings based on the hourly rate ($25/hour):**
   - Total earnings = Total duration (in hours) × Hourly wage ($25/hour)
   
\[
\text{Total earnings} = (\text{Total duration} \times 3 \text{ hours}) \times \$25/\text{hour}
\]

5. **Subtract the total cost from the total earnings to find the profit:**
   - Cost = Total earnings – Payment received ($500)

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total earnings} - \$500
\]

Now let’s perform the calculations:

1. **Number of rentals per month**: 10
2. **Duration per rental**: 3 hours
3. **Total duration**:
   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]
4. **Total days**:
   \[
   \frac{30}{24} = 1.25 \text{ days}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine how many notebooks Joseph has:**
   - Martha has \( x \) notebooks.
   - Joseph has \( 3x \) notebooks (since he has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha).

2. **Calculate how many notebooks Martha buys:**
   - Martha decides to buy 5 more notebooks.

3. **Find out how many notebooks Martha has after buying:**
   - Before buying: \( x \)
   - Bought 5 more: \( x + 5 \)

4. **Set up an equation based on the information that Martha ends up with 7 notebooks:**
   - \( x + 5 = 7 \)

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: 
     \[
     x = 2
     \]

6. **Now know how many notebooks Martha originally had:**
   - Since \( x = 2 \), Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

7. **Determine how many notebooks Joseph has:**
   - Joseph has \( 3x \):
     \[
     3(2) = 6
     \]
   - So, Joseph has 6 notebooks.

8. **Calculate how many more notebooks Martha has compared to Joseph:**
   - Difference in number of notebooks:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 6 = 7 - 6 = 1
     \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 1.<|im_end|>","Since she bought 5 more to have 7, she originally had 7-5 = <<7-5=2>>2 notebooks

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how far Anis rowed
Given:
- Dijana rowed for 50 miles in one day.
- Anis rowed \( \frac{6}{5} \) times as many miles as Dijana.

First, calculate how many miles Anis rowed:
\[ \text{Anis' miles} = 50 \times \frac{6}{5} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 50 \times \frac{6}{5} = 50 \times 1.2 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance both rowers traveled
Now we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
\[ \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance the two rowers traveled on that day is **110 miles**.<|im_end|>","Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.
The total distance Anis covered is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 miles.
The two of them rowed for 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 miles on that day.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies before any were taken away**
- Susan made 100 cookies.

**Step 2: Subtract the number of cookies that were taken away**
- Her husband took 4 cookies.
- Therefore, subtracting from the total number of cookies gives us: 
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

**Step 3: Divide the remaining cookies among the 6 nephews**
- There are 6 nephews.
- Each nephew should receive an equal share.
- So, we divide 96 cookies by 6:
\[ \frac{96}{6} = 16 \]

Therefore, each of Susan's nephews will get **16 cookies**. 

So, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Denise read 10 pages yesterday.
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
- Denise read 5 more pages today than she did yesterday.
- Daniel could not read any pages today because he had an accident.

### Step 2: Calculate how many pages Denise read today
Since Denise read 5 more pages today than she did yesterday, we can calculate her total for today as follows:

\[ \text{Denise's pages today} = \text{Denise's pages yesterday} + 5 \]

Given that Denise read 10 pages yesterday, we substitute:

\[ \text{Denise's pages today} = 10 + 5 = 15 \]

So, Denise read 15 pages today.

### Step 3: Determine how many pages Daniel read today
Since Daniel could not read any pages today due to his accident, he must have read 0 pages today.

### Step 4: Compare the number of pages read between Denise and Daniel
Now, we compare the number of pages each person read over the two days.

- Denise read 15 pages in total (yesterday and today).
- Daniel read 0 pages in total (since he couldn't read).

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in the number of pages read
Finally, to find out how many more pages Denise read compared to Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number of pages Denise read:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Denise's total pages} - \text{Daniel's total pages} \]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[ \text{Difference} = 15 - 0 = 15 \]

### Conclusion
Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 15}

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup given that there is enough soup to fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls.

1. **Determine the total number of bowls available:**
   - There is enough soup to fill four adult’s bowls.
   - There is enough soup to fill eight child’s bowls.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of bowls available:**
   \[
   4 \text{ (adults)} + 8 \text{ (children)} = 12 \text{ bowls}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of adults and children in Calvin’s family:**
   - Calvin is eating with his adult wife.
   - His adult wife is included in the count.
   - They have two children.

4. **Verify the number of bowls per person type:**
   - The total number of bowls should be divided equally between adults and children so that they can eat without any leftovers.
   - Since there are 12 bowls and 5 people (Calvin, his wife, and 2 children), divide the total number of bowls by the number of people:
     \[
     \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \text{ bowls per person}
     \]
   - This means each person gets 2.4 bowls of soup, which is more than necessary but ensures that no one goes hungry.

5. **Calculate how many times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - Each child will get 2.4 bowls.
   - Divide the total number of bowls per person by the number of bowls each child gets:
     \[
     \frac{2.4 \text{ bowls}}{2.4 \text{ bowls per child}} = 1 \text{ time}
     \]

Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup once during lunch from the leftover soup.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1}
\]<|im_end|>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.
Calvin and his wife will eat two adult bowls, so they will eat the equivalent of 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 children’s bowls.
Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.
There are 2 children, so each child will be able to eat a bowl of leftover soup for lunch 2 / 2 = <<2/2=1>>1 time.

- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.
\[ \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 5 \times \$1.50 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication for the cost of the notebooks.
\[ 5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50 \]

So far, the total cost for the notebooks is $7.50.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of one ballpen.
- Each ballpen costs $0.50.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for the number of ballpens William bought (assuming he bought more than one).
- Let's assume William bought 2 ballpens.
\[ \text{Total cost of ballpens} = 2 \times \$0.50 \]

Step 5: Perform the multiplication for the cost of the ballpens.
\[ 2 \times \$0.50 = \$1.00 \]

Now, add the total cost of the ballpens to the total cost of the notebooks to get the overall amount spent.
\[ \text{Overall amount spent} = \$7.50 + \$1.00 = \$8.50 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much material Jo needs in total to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the amount of material needed for one small mask:**
   - According to the given information, Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for one small mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ small masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks:**
   - The amount of material needed for 20 small masks is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for 20 small masks} = 20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of material needed for one large mask:**
   - According to the given information, Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the amount of material needed for one large mask is:
     \[
     \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ large masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total material needed for 8 large masks:**
   - The amount of material needed for 8 large masks is:
     \[
     \text{Total material for 8 large masks} = 8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

5. **Add the materials needed for both types of masks:**
   - The total amount of material needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total material needed} = 10 \text{ yards (for small masks)} + 6 \text{ yards (for large masks)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total material needed} = 16 \text{ yards}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Jo would need a total of 16 yards of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16 \text{ yards}}
\]<|im_end|>","It takes 2 yards of material / 4 small masks = <<2/4=0.5>>0.5 yards of material per mask.

Tim has 7 blue shoe boxes + 9 red shoe boxes = 16 shoe boxes in total.

**Step 2: Determine how many shoe boxes Tim uses for fishing**
- He uses 3 blue shoe boxes.
- For the red shoe boxes, he uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of them.

So, the number of red shoe boxes used is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \).

**Step 3: Subtract the used shoe boxes from the total number**
- Blue shoes left: \( 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- Red shoes left: \( 9 - 3 = 6 \)

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of books Joseph has:**
   - Sarah has 9 books.
   - Joseph has twice as many books as Sarah.

\[
\text{Number of books Joseph initially has} = 2 \times \text{(number of books Sarah has)}
\]

2. Calculate the total number of books Joseph initially has:

\[
\text{Number of books Joseph initially has} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

3. **Account for the books Joseph lost:**
   - Joseph loses 2 books.

\[
\text{Final number of books Joseph has} = \text{Initial number of books Joseph has} - \text{Books lost}
\]

4. Perform the subtraction to find out how many books Joseph has left after losing some:

\[
\text{Final number of books Joseph has} = 18 - 2 = 16

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age.
   - Let \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Duncan’s current age \( D = 60 \).
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was twice as much as Adam's age four years ago.

3. **Formulate Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
   - Four years ago, Adam's age would have been \( A - 4 \).

4. **Set Up the Equation According to the Problem Statement:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of acres on both farmers' farms.

Step 1: Determine how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has.
- We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm.
- Therefore, the number of acres on Farmer Smith's farm can be represented as \( 2B + 100 \).

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the given information.
- According to the problem, the total number of acres on both farms is equal to 300 (since it's half the area of Farmer Brown's farm).
- So, the equation will be: 
\[ B + (2B + 100) = 300 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( B \).
- Combine like terms: \( B + 2B + 100 = 300 \)
- Simplify: \( 3B + 100 = 300 \)
- Subtract 100 from both sides: \( 3B = 200 \)
- Divide by 3: \( B = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \)

Step 4: Calculate the total number of acres on both farms.
- The total number of acres is the sum of the areas of both farms:
\[ B + (2B + 100) = \frac{200}{3} + (\frac{200}{3} \times 2 + 100) \]
- Simplify further:
\[ \frac{200}{3} + \left( \frac{400}{3} + 100 \right) = \frac{200}{3} + \left( \frac{400}{3} + \frac{300}{3} \right) = \frac{200}{3} + \frac{700}{3} \]
- Add the fractions:
\[ \frac{900}{3} = 300 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour.
- We know that Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.
- So, he completes \(50 - 10 = 40\) packages per hour.

Step 2: Calculate how much Colby earns in one hour.
- Since he earns $0.20 for each package he completes, his earnings per hour would be \(40 \times 0.20\).

Let's do the calculation for the hourly wage first:
\[ 40 \times 0.20 = 8 \]
So, Colby earns $8 in one hour.

Step 3: Calculate his total earnings for an eight-hour workday.
- To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly wage by 8 hours.

Now let's perform the calculation for the total earnings:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is $\boxed{64}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much time it takes for John to complete an extreme Sudoku:**
   - It's given that an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a regular one.
   - Regular Sudoku = 45 minutes
   - Extreme Sudoku = \( 4 \times 45 \) minutes

2. **Calculate the total time John spends on both Sudokus:**
   - Regular Sudoku = 45 minutes
   - Extreme Sudoku = \( 4 \times 45 \) minutes (from above)
   - Total time = Regular + Extreme = 45 + \( 4 \times 45 \)

3. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Time in hours = Total time / 60

4. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks based on the total time spent:**
   - John drinks 1 bottle every half hour.

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the time for an extreme Sudoku
Regular Sudoku = 45 minutes
Extreme Sudoku = \( 4 \times 45 \) minutes
Extreme Sudoku = \( 4 \times 45 \) minutes
Extreme Sudoku = 180 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on both Sudokus
Total time = Regular + Extreme
Total time = 45 minutes + 180 minutes
Total time = 225 minutes

### Step 3: Convert the total time into hours
Total time in hours = 225 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour
Total time in hours = 3.75 hours

### Step 4: Calculate the number of bottles of water consumed
John drinks 1 bottle every half hour.
Number of bottles = Total time in hours × Number of bottles per hour
Number of bottles = 3.75 hours × 2 bottles/hour
Number of bottles = 7.5 bottles

Therefore, John drinks 7.5 bottles of water in that time.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons based on the given information about Benny's throwing pattern.

1. **Calculate total pieces of bologna thrown for red balloons:**
   - Benny throws 2 pieces per red balloon.
   - There are 20 red balloons.
   - Total pieces for red balloons = \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

2. **Determine remaining pieces of bologna after accounting for red balloons:**
   - Total pieces thrown = 58.
   - Pieces left for yellow balloons = \( 58 - 40 = 18 \).

3. **Calculate total pieces of bologna thrown for yellow balloons:**
   - Benny throws 3 pieces per yellow balloon.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Since there are 20 red balloons, the number of yellow balloons is \( 20 + y \).
   - Therefore, the equation for the total pieces of bologna thrown is:
     \[
     3y = 18
     \]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[

- Jon drives 100 miles per day.
- There are 30 days in his month.

\[ \text{Total miles driven} = 100 \times 30 \]

\[

**Step 2: Calculate how many tune-ups Jon needs based on the total miles driven**

- Tune-ups are needed every 1000 miles.

To find out how many tune-ups he needs, divide the total miles driven by the interval between tune-ups (1000 miles).

\[
\text{Tune-ups needed} = \frac{\text{Total miles driven}}{\text{Interval between tune-ups}}

2. **Calculate the number of hours Bruce works on Wednesday:**
   - According to the problem, Bruce works twice as long on Wednesday as he does on Tuesday.
     \[
     \text{Hours on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Hours on Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of items purchased

First, we need to calculate the total cost of all items purchased.

- **Cake**: $11
- **Balloons**:
    - Each balloon costs $0.5.
    - Since they bought 1 dozen (12) balloons, we can find the total cost per balloon first: 
        \[
        \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{\$0.5}{12} = \$\frac{1}{24}
        \]
    - Therefore, the total cost for 12 balloons is:
        \[
        \text{Total cost for balloons} = 12 \times \frac{1}{24} = \$0.50
        \]

- **Ice Cream**:
    - Each tub of ice cream costs $7.
    - They bought 2 tubs, so:
        \[
        \text{Total cost for ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14
        \]

Now, sum up the costs of all items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$0.50 + \$14 = \$25.50
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount given by their mother

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances, let \( A \) represent the amount of allowance each girl received from their mother. Together, they spent $25.50, so:
\[
A + A = \$25.50
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A = \$25.50
\]
Solving for \( A \):
\[
A = \frac{\$25.50}{2} = \$12.75
\]

Thus, Julia and Nadine’s mother gave each of them $12.75.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\boxed{12.75}<|im_end|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.

The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of fruits Kira initially had:**
   - Kira bought 3 apples.
   - Kira bought 5 bananas.
   - Kira bought 6 oranges.

   Total fruits = Apples + Bananas + Oranges
                  = 3 + 5 + 6
                  = 14 fruits

2. **Determine how many fruits Lola ate:**
   - Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

3. **Subtract the number of fruits eaten by Lola from the initial total:**
   - Initial total = 14 fruits
   - Fruits eaten by Lola = 2 fruits

   Remaining fruits = Initial total - Fruits eaten by Lola
                     = 14 - 2
                     = 12 fruits

Therefore, after Lola ate her fruits, there are **12 pieces** of fruit left.<|im_end|>","Kira bought 3 + 5 + 6 = <<3+5+6=14>>14 pieces of fruit.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the number of students playing tennis.
According to the problem, the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of students playing tennis, so we can write:
\[ y = 2x \]

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know that there are 6 students playing tennis (which matches our variable definition). Therefore:
\[ x = 6 \]

Next, we have information about the number of students playing soccer. The problem states there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. Since all students play at least one sport, we can assume these numbers are distributed among the volleyball players as well.

### Step 3: Calculate Number of Students Playing Volleyball
Since \( y \) represents the number of volleyball players and \( y = 2x \):
\[ y = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 students playing volleyball.

### Step 4: Determine Total Number of Students
Now we need to find out how many students are in total. We already know:
- 6 students are playing tennis.
- 12 students are playing volleyball.

Total number of students:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of students is **18**.<|im_end|>","There are 6 x 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 students playing volleyball.

To determine how much money the class raised from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
3. Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
4. Find the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold
Each of the 30 students sold 10 lollipops on average. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ \text{Total number of lollipops} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling the lollipops
Each lollipop costs $0.8, so the total revenue from selling all the lollipops is:
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.8 = \$240 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops
The cost to buy each lollipop is $0.5, so the total cost for 300 lollipops is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.5 = \$150 \]

### Step 4: Find the profit
The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = 240 - 150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling the lollipops.<|im_end|>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of dogs Larry has.
Larry has 3 cats. According to the information given, he has ""! 3"" times as many dogs as cats.

\[ \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of rabbits Larry has.
Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than the number of dogs.

\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of fish Larry has.
Larry has 3 times as many fish as the number of rabbits.

\[ \text{Number of fish} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of gerbils Larry has.
Larry has a collection of gerbils that is \( \frac{1}{3} \) the number of fish he has.

\[ \text{Number of gerbils} = \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all the pets Larry has.
Now we can add up all the different types of pets Larry has:

- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets Larry has is:

To determine how long the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can consume together in one day and then divide the total number of slices by that amount.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices Abby can eat per day.
Abby eats 2 slices per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices Josh can eat per day.
Josh eats twice as much as Abby, so he eats \(2 \times 2 = 4\) slices per day.

Step 3: Determine the combined daily consumption for both Abby and Josh.
Combined, they eat \(2 + 4 = 6\) slices per day.

Step 4: Divide the total number of slices in the loaf by their combined daily consumption.
The loaf contains 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we perform the division: 
\[
\frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last **4** days.<|im_end|>","Josh can eat 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 slices a day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, let's break down the information given:

1. **Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old**.
2. **She collects one shell per month**.

First, we need to calculate how long it took her to reach 10 years old from her starting age (5 years).

- Time elapsed = 10 years - 5 years = 5 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find out how many months are in 5 years:

\[ \text{Number of months} = 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}. \]

Now, since Martha collects one shell per month, we can calculate the total number of shells she collected over these 60 months:

\[ \text{Total number of shells} = 60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}. \]

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected **60 shells**.

How many cups of mint tea are in each : row?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine how many rows Lana makes:**
   - Lana has 27 cups of tea.
   - She divides these into 3 rows.

2. **Calculate the number of cups per row:**
   - To find out how many cups are in each row, divide the total number of cups (27) by the number of rows (3).

\[
\text{Cups per row} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Number of rows}} = \frac{27}{3} = 9
\]

So, there are 9 cups of tea in each row.

3. **Verify that the total number of cups per row matches the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea combined:**
   - Since Lana uses all 27 cups to make chamomile and mint tea, let's calculate how many cups of each type she makes.

4. **Calculate the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row:**
   - Since there are 9 cups in each row and Lana wants an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea, she will have:
   
\[
\text{Chamomile cups per row} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

However, since the number of cups must be a whole number, we realize that this calculation might not align perfectly with the problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the distribution:

- If we assume the problem allows fractional cups, then each row would indeed contain 4.5 cups of chamomile tea. But typically, such problems expect integer solutions unless otherwise stated.

Given the constraints, if we're dealing with whole numbers, we need to rethink the problem setup or consider fractional cups which isn't typical in tea making scenarios.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem setup:**
   - The problem states ""she divides these into 3 rows"" but doesn't specify how much chamomile and mint tea she puts in each row. Given the context, it seems more likely that she distributes them equally without specifying quantities.

6. **Final calculation based on the given information:**

Since the problem specifies chamomile and mint tea should be divided equally in each row, and assuming no fractions are allowed, we conclude that each row contains exactly 4.5 cups of chamomile tea, but practically, we can't have half a cup. 

Therefore, the correct interpretation is that each row contains 4.5 cups of chamomile tea, and we don't have enough information to determine the exact number of cups of mint tea in each row without further specification.

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 4.5 cups of chamomile tea per row.<|im_end|>","If there are 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then there are a total of 27 – 15 = <<27-15=12>>12 cups of chamomile or mint tea.

Dividing these into rows shows that each row holds 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 cups of mint tea.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip that allows him to reach his goal within the given time frame.

1. **Determine total trips needed**: The sloth needs to collect 24 berries over 8 hours.
   - Total trips = Total berries / Berries per trip = 24 berries / Berries per trip

2. **Calculate trips based on available time**:
   - Each trip takes 4 hours (given).
   
3. **Divide total trips by total time**:
   - Number of trips = Total trips / Time per trip
   
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total trips}}{\text{Time per trip}}
   \]

Let's calculate:

- Let \( T \) be the number of trips required.
\[
T = \frac{24}{\text{Berries per trip}}
\]
- Given: Time per trip = 4 hours,
\[
T = \frac{24}{\text{Berries per trip}}
\]

Since the sloth makes one trip down and one trip back up, the total time spent for each trip is \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours.

Given the time constraint, we find the maximum number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[
\text{Maximum Trips} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ trips}
\]

Now, we divide the total berries by the maximum number of trips to find the minimum number of berries picked per trip:
\[
\text{Minimum Berries per Trip} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of berries the sloth should pick up per trip to achieve his goal is 6.

   - Anthony and his father fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   - The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
   - Therefore, the tank initially has \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \) gallons.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water used over 6 days:**
   - The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

3. **Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank:**
   - Initially, there were 5,000 gallons in the tank.
   - After 6 days, the amount of water left in the tank is \( 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons} \).

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. Colby has $150 to spend.
2. The cost structure per movie (Friday/Saturday) is: 
   - Ticket = $10
   - Popcorn = $8
   - Candy = $2
3. Total cost per movie = $10 + $8 + $2 = $20
4. Colby wants to ensure he buys popcorn and candy.

Now, let's calculate how many movies he can afford based on the number of popcorn and candy purchases he intends to make.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for one movie including popcorn and candy.
Total cost per movie = $20

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of movies he can buy considering only popcorn and candy.

Let's denote the number of movies as \( n \).

For popcorn:
Cost for popcorn = $8 * n

For candy:
Cost for candy = $2 * n

Total cost for popcorn and candy = $8n + $2n = $10n

Since Colby has $150, we need to find out how much money he spends on popcorn and candy in terms of movies.

Let's assume he buys \( x \) movies where \( x \leq n \). Then the cost would be:
Cost for popcorn and candy = $10x

Given that Colby has $150, we set up an equation:
$10x ≤ $150

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x \leq \frac{150}{10} \]
\[ x \leq 15 \]

So, he can buy up to 15 movies without exceeding his budget.

However, we also know that he wants to include 5 movies from both Friday and Saturday, plus 8 movies from other days. So, the total number of movies he can actually afford should not exceed the sum of these numbers.

Total desired movies = 5 (from Friday and Saturday) + 8 (other days) = 13

Therefore, the maximum number of movies he can afford while adhering to his goal is 13.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is 13.<|im_end|>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56
He has spent $16 on popcorn because 2 x 8 = <<16=16>>16
He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10
He has $10 left to spend because 150 - 130 - 10 = <<150-130-10=10>>10
He can see 1 movie because 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1

                    question:
                    , Andrew bakes ! 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini : blueberry . muffins. A , normal ; cinnamon . roll ; has 600 calories ! and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. ; If , a mini , pastry : has ; 1/3rd , of the ! calories . of ; a normal version, . how , many ; calories : do : the ? pastries he baked ? have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of mini cinnamon rolls
Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- Each mini cinnamon roll contains \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories as a regular cinnamon roll.
- The total calorie count for one mini cinnamon roll = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 \) calories.
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \) calories per mini cinnamon roll.

### Step 2: Calculate the total calorie count for all mini cinnamon rolls
Since there are 200 mini cinnamon rolls,
\[ \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of mini blueberry muffins
Andrew also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- Each mini blueberry muffin contains \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the calories as a regular blueberry muffin.
- The total calorie count for one mini blueberry muffin = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 \) calories.
- Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \) calories per mini blueberry muffin.

### Step 4: Calculate the total calorie count for all mini blueberry muffins
Since there are 300 mini blueberry muffins,
\[ \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \]

### Step 5: Sum up the total calorie counts
Now we sum up the calories from both types of mini pastries to get the total calorie count.
\[ \text{Total calories} = 40,000 (from mini cinnamon rolls) + 45,000 (from mini blueberry muffins) \]
\[ \text{Total calories} = 85,000 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is **85,000**.<|im_end|>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini cinnamon rolls: 200 calories/roll * 200 rolls = <<200*200=40000>>40000 calories
Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of Junebugs removed over five days and then divide that by the number of days (which is 5) to find the average.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Removed 39 Junebugs.
   
2. **Tuesday:**
   - She removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 39 \times 2 = 78 \) Junebugs.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She removed twice as many Junebugs as on Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 39 \times 2 = 78 \) Junebugs.

4. **Thursday:**
   - She removed four times as many Junebugs as on Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 39 \times 4 = 156 \) Junebugs.

5. **Friday:**
   - She removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's sum up all the Junebugs removed over these five days:

- Total Junebugs removed: 
  \( 39 + 78 + 78 + 156 + 57 \)

Let's add them together:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 156 = 351
\]
\[
351 + 57 = 408
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 408.

Finally, to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (which is 5):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{408}{5}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{408}{5} = 81.6
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs removed per day is \( 81.6 \).

**The final answer is:**  
\[ \boxed{81.6} \]<|im_end|>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs

                    A bus travels 60 miles per hour , for 5 hours. A car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. How much farther did the bus go than the car, in miles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we need to calculate the distance each vehicle traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

1. **Calculate the distance the bus traveled:**
   - The formula for distance is \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - For the bus: 
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance the car traveled:**
   - Similarly, for the car:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 240 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in distance:**
   - Subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values calculated:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles more than the car. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's define the variables for their ages:

- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.
- Let \( P' \) be Paul's age.

We are given three pieces of information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Let's translate these into equations:

1. \( P + P' + J = 100 \)
2. \( P' = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = P' + J \)

Now, we will substitute \( P' \) from equation (2) into equation (3):

\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( P \) in terms of \( J \) into equation (1):

\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ J = 20 \]

Now, using \( J = 20 \), find \( P' \) (Paul's age):

\[ P' = J + 10 \]
\[ P' = 20 + 10 \]
\[ P' = 30 \]

Finally, find Peter's age \( P \):

\[ P = 2J + 10 \]
\[ P = 2(20) + 10 \]
\[ P = 40 + 10 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is {The final answer is} 50 years.<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10

Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of friends:**
   - Maria invited 4 friends to her party.

2. **Calculate the initial number of balloons given by Maria:**
   - Maria gives each friend 2 water balloons.
   - Number of friends = 4
   - Balloons per friend = 2
   - Total balloons from friends = 4 * 2 = 8

3. **Add the initial balloon for Maria herself:**
   - Maria has 1 additional balloon.
   - Total balloons so far = 8 (from friends) + 1 (for herself) = 9

4. **Account for the balloons given by her mom:**
   - Her mom gives each person (including herself) 3 more balloons.
   - Number of people = 5 (Maria + 4 friends)
   - Balloons per person = 3
   - Total balloons from mom = 5 * 3 = 15

5. **Calculate the total number of balloons:**

To determine how many new tables are needed for the charity group's yard sale, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of items donated:** 
   - 10 people donating.
   - Each person donates 5 boxes of stuff.
   
   Therefore, total items donated = 10 people * 5 boxes/person = 50 boxes.

2. **Number of boxes that can fit on one table:**
   - The group has 2 boxes per table available.

3. **Current number of boxes owned:**
   - They currently have 10 boxes.

4. **Calculate the additional boxes needed:**
   - Total items donated = 50 boxes.
   - Current boxes = 10 boxes.
   - Additional boxes needed = 50 boxes (total) - 10 boxes (current) = 40 boxes.

5. **Determine the number of tables required for these additional boxes:**
   - Since each table holds 2 boxes, we divide the total number of boxes needed by the capacity of one table.
   - Number of tables needed = 40 boxes / 2 boxes/table = 20 tables.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The charity group needs 20 more tables to accommodate all the donated items.

To find the average total distance spat by both contestants, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance spit by Zoey.
2. Calculate the total distance spit by Sydney.
3. Find the sum of the distances spit by both contestants.
4. Divide this sum by two (since there are two contestants).

Let's start with the calculations.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance spit by Zoey**

Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Therefore, the total distance spat by Zoey is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance spit by Sydney**

Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. Therefore, the total distance spat by Sydney is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 3: Find the sum of the distances spat by both contestants**

The total distance spat by both contestants combined is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

**Step 4: Divide the sum by two**

Since there are two contestants, we divide the total distance by 2:
\[ \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the average total distance spat is:

How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a , month with 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a period of one month (30 days), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate daily production:**
   - The Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
   - It operates for 24 hours in a day.

\[
\text{Daily Production} = \text{Hourly Production} \times \text{Hours per Day} = 60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 24 \, \text{hours/day} = 1440 \, \text{widgets/day}
\]

2. **Calculate total monthly production:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.

\[
\text{Total Monthly Production} = \text{Daily Production} \times \text{Number of Days} = 1440 \, \text{widgets/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets}
\]

3. **Calculate revenue from both machines:**

- **Widgeteer 3000**:
  - Selling price per widget is $6.
  
\[
\text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} = \text{Total Widgets Produced} \times \text{Price per Widget} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259,200
\]

- **WidgetMaster 9000**: 
  - Same selling price as the Widgeteer 3000 ($6).

\[
\text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000} = \text{Total Widgets Produced} \times \text{Price per Widget} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259,200
\]

4. **Determine the difference in revenue:**

\[
\text{Difference in Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Widgeteer 3000} - \text{Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000} = \$259,200 - \$259,200 = \$0
\]

### Conclusion:
Fern will make the same amount of money from either machine over the course of one month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of hours**: Cameron stays at the hotel from 5 PM until 10 AM the next day. This is a total of:
   - From 5 PM to midnight: 7 hours (from 5 PM to 6 PM + 3 hours)
   - Midnight to 10 AM: 9 hours (from 6 PM to 7 AM + 1 hour)

So, the total stay time is 7 + 9 = 16 hours.

2. **Calculate the cost based on the given options**:
   - Option 1: Stay for 12 hours at 1000 pesos per hour.
     Cost = 12 * 1000 = 12,000 pesos
   - Option 2: Stay for 24 hours at 1600 pesos per hour.
     Cost = 24 * 1600 = 38,400 pesos

3. **Compare the costs**:
   - Option 1 (12-hour stay) is cheaper than Option 2 (24-hour stay).

Therefore, Cameron should choose the 12-hour stay because it saves him money.

4. **Calculate the savings**:
   - Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay - Cost of 12-hour stay
   - Savings = 38,400 - 12,000 = 26,400 pesos

So, Cameron would save 26,400 pesos if he chooses the 12-hour stay over the 24-hour stay.

{The final answer is} 26,400 pesos.<|im_end|>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the requirements for each animal.
- **Goats**: Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.
- **Sheep**: Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what each goat needs.

First, calculate how much each sheep needs in terms of the goat's requirement:
\[ \text{Each sheep's requirement} = (2 \times \text{goat's requirement}) - 3 \]

Substitute the goat's requirement into the equation:
\[ \text{Each sheep's requirement} = (2 \times 5) - 3 \]
\[ \text{Each sheep's requirement} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Each sheep's requirement} = 7 \] pounds.

### Step 2: Calculate the total hay needed for all goats.
- There are 15 goats, and each goat requires 5 pounds of hay.
\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Total hay for goats} = 75 \] pounds.

### Step 3: Calculate the total hay needed for all sheep.
- There are 12 sheep, and each sheep requires 7 pounds of hay.
\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total hay for sheep} = 84 \] pounds.

### Step 4: Add the totals from Step 2 and Step 3 to get the overall total.
\[ \text{Total hay needed} = (\text{Total hay for goats} + \text{Total hay for sheep}) \]
\[ \text{Total hay needed} = (75 + 84) \]
\[ \text{Total hay needed} = 159 \] pounds.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\] pounds of hay does Nate need.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep

Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate John's total earnings for the week.
John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours per day. There are 7 days in a week.

Total earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked per day × Days in a week
= $50 × 6 hours/day × 7 days/week
= $50 × 42 hours/week
= $2100

So far, we have calculated John's total earnings for the week.

### Step 2: Determine how much money John has left after spending on gas.
John spent $50 on gas. 

Money left = Total earnings - Gas expenses
= $2100 - $50
= $2050

Now, we subtract his gas expense from his total earnings to find out how much money John has left before making any purchases.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after buying 5 pencils.
Each pencil costs $10.

Cost of 5 pencils = 5 × $10
= $50

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the money left after gas expenses gives us the remaining amount before buying more pens.

Remaining money = Money left after gas expenses - Cost of 5 pencils
= $2050 - $50
= $2000

### Step 4: Calculate how many $25 pen sets John can buy with the remaining money.
Each set of pens costs $25.

Number of sets = Remaining money / Set price
= $2000 / $25
= 80

So, John can buy 80 sets of $25 pens with the remaining money.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} John can buy 80 sets of $25 pens after he spends on gas and buys 5 pencils.<|im_end|>","He earned $50*6=$<<50*6=300>>300

After buying gas and pencils he has $200 - $50 - $50 = $<<200-50-50=100>>100 to spend on pens
He can buy $100/25=<<100/25=4>>4 pens

Craig has spelled out 20 words.

### Step 2: Determine the number of words spelled by Craig's brother
Since Craig has spelled out 20 words, and there were 10 rounds, Craig's brother must have also spelled out 20 words.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig has spelled
Craig has spelled out words with 15 letters each. So, for 20 words, he has:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ letters} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of letters in the words Craig's brother has spelled
Craig's brother has spelled out words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's (since Craig's brother spelled out 20 words). Therefore, the total number of letters in these words is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \text{ letters} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice given out**

- There are 29 students.
- Each student receives 2 bottles of apple juice.

\[ \text{Total bottles per student} = 2 \]

\[ \text{Total bottles for all students} = 29 \times 2 = 58 \]

So far, we've accounted for 58 bottles of apple juice that were distributed among the students.

**Step 2: Determine the number of coupons available**

- The teacher has 9 coupons.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice that could be redeemed**

- Each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice.

\[ \text{Total bottles per coupon} = 100 \]

\[ \text{Total bottles from all coupons} = 9 \times 100 = 900 \]

So, the teacher has 900 bottles of apple juice available.

**Step 4: Subtract the number of bottles already distributed from the total number of bottles available**

- We know 58 bottles were already distributed.

\[ \text{Remaining bottles after distribution} = 900 - 58 = 842 \]

So, the teacher still has 842 bottles of apple juice left.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the components of the bill:**
   - Base service fee: $40 (visit + house)
   - Labor cost: $35/hour * number of hours worked
   - Parts cost: $60

2. **Calculate the labor cost:**
   - Number of hours worked = 2.25 hours
   - Labor rate = $35/hour
   - Total labor cost = $35/hour * 2.25 hours = $81.75

3. **Sum up all costs:**
   - Base service fee = $40
   - Labor cost = $81.75
   - Parts cost = $60

4. **Add these together to get the total bill amount:**
   - Total bill = $40 (base) + $81.75 (labor) + $60 (parts)

Let's perform the addition:
\[ \text{Total bill} = $40 + $81.75 + $60 \]

First add $40 and $60:
\[ $40 + $60 = $100 \]

Then add $100 and $81.75:
\[ $100 + $81.75 = $181.75 \]

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total cost before any discounts:**
   - James buys 10 CDs at $15 each.
   - Total cost = 10 * $15 = $150.

2. **Apply the discount:**
   - The CDs are sold at 40% off.
   - Discount amount = 10 * $15 * 40/100 = $60.
   - Cost after discount = $150 - $60 = $90.

3. **Determine how many CDs he keeps:**
   - James decides not to keep all 10 CDs.
   - He decides not to keep 5 CDs.
   - Number of CDs kept = 10 - 5 = 5.

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining CDs:**
   - He sells the remaining 5 CDs at $.40 each.
   - Revenue from selling these CDs = 5 * $.40 = $2.

5. **Calculate the total money spent:**
   - Money spent on buying the CDs initially = $150.
   - Money received from selling CDs = $2.
   - Net profit = Money received - Money spent = $2 - $150 = -$148 (negative value indicates a loss).

So, the final answer is that James is out of money, but in a negative sense as it represents a financial loss of $148.<|im_end|>","He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling all the root crops. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from each type of root crop.

#### Yams
- Number of yams = 6
- Price per yam = $1.5
- Revenue from yams = \( 6 \times 1.5 = \$9 \)

#### Sweet Potatoes
- Number of sweet potatoes = 10
- Price per sweet potato = $2
- Revenue from sweet potatoes = \( 10 \times 2 = \$20 \)

#### Carrots
- Number of carrots = 4
- Price per carrot = $1.25
- Revenue from carrots = \( 4 \times 1.25 = \$5 \)

### Step 2: Sum up the revenues from all types of root crops.
- Total revenue = Revenue from yams + Revenue from sweet potatoes + Revenue from carrots
- Total revenue = $9 + $20 + $5 = **$34**

Therefore, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn **$34** in total.<|im_end|>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.
She can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.

Therefore, she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 if she sells everything.

                    question:
                    James loves ; to go swimming , and has to , swim across ; a 20-mile lake.  : He can swim at a ; pace ? of 2 miles per ; hour. .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down James' journey into steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James needs to swim:**
   - The total distance across the lake is 20 miles.

2. **Determine how far James swims before stopping on the island:**
   - James swims 60% of the total distance.
     \[
     \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time James spends swimming from the start to the point where he stops on the island:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
     \[
     \text{Time spent swimming} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the time James spends resting after stopping on the island:**
   - James rests for half the time he swam.
     \[
     \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining distance James still needs to swim after his rest stop:**
   - Subtract the distance already covered (12 miles) from the total distance.
     \[
     \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Determine the new swimming speed when James resumes his journey:**
   - His original speed was 2 miles per hour, but now he swims half as fast.
     \[
     \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile/hour}
     \]

7. **Calculate the time James takes to cover the remaining distance after resuming swimming:**
   - Use the formula for time taken, which is distance divided by speed.
     \[
     \text{Time taken to swim remaining distance} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

8. **Add up all the times to find the total time James took to cross the lake:**
   - Time spent swimming + Time resting + Time swimming remaining distance.
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} (\text{swimming}) + 3 \text{ hours} (\text{resting}) + 8 \text{ hours} (\text{remaining distance})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total time James took to get across the lake is \(17\) hours.<|im_end|>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.
So he rested 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours.
He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent the number of loaves of bread that Sam had last Friday.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem, the bakery has \( 7S - 40 \) loaves of bread compared to Sam's amount.
   
3. **Substitute the Known Value:**
   We know that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday (\( S = 70 \)).
   
4. **Calculate the Bakery’s Loaves:**
   Substitute \( S = 70 \) into the equation for the bakery’s loaves:
   \[
   7S - 40 = 7(70) - 40
   \]
   
5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   Calculate \( 7 \times 70 \):
   \[
   7 \times 70 = 490
   \]
   Then subtract 40 from 490:
   \[
   490 - 40 = 450

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the commissions based on the given prices and percentages for both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Commission Calculation for the New York Times:
1. **Price per copy**: $5
2. **Commission rate for the New York Times**: 10%

   - Calculate the commission on one copy:
     \[
     \text{Commission per copy} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Commission rate}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Commission per copy} = \$5 \times 0.10 = \$0.50
     \]

3. **Number of copies sold**: 6

   - Total commission from the New York Times:
     \[
     \text{Total commission} = \text{Commission per copy} \times \text{Number of copies}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total commission} = \$0.50 \times 6 = \$3.00
     \]

#### Commission Calculation for the Wall Street Journal:
1. **Price per copy**: $15
2. **Commission rate for the Wall Street Journal**: 8%

   - Calculate the commission on one copy:
     \[
     \text{Commission per copy} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Commission rate}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Commission per copy} = \$15 \times 0.08 = \$1.20
     \]

3. **Number of copies sold**: 10

   - Total commission from the Wall Street Journal:
     \[
     \text{Total commission} = \text{Commission per copy} \times \text{Number of copies}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total commission} = \$1.20 \times 10 = \$12.00
     \]

#### Final Answer:
Summing up the total commissions from both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal gives us:
\[
\text{Total commission} = \$3.00 + \$12.00 = \$15.00
\]

Therefore, the total commission that Cayley will earn is \boxed{15}.<|im_end|>","He gets a commission of 10% on each copy of the New York Times so for 6 copies he will get 6*$5*(10/100) = $<<6*5*(10/100)=3>>3

To determine how old Marcus is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age:**
   - Marcus is described as ""half"" of Leo's age.
   
2. **Express this relationship mathematically:**
   - Let \( L \) represent Leo's age.
   - Then, Marcus's age can be represented as \( \frac{L}{2} \).

3. **Identify the relationship between Deanna's age and Marcus's age:**
   - Deanna is described as ""five years younger"" than Marcus.
   
4. **Express this relationship mathematically:**
   - Since Deanna is \( x \) years older than Marcus, and Deanna is 26 years old, then Marcus must be \( 26 + x \) years old.

5. **Substitute into the previous equation:**
   - From step 3, we have \( x = 26 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 26 \) back into the equation from step 2: 
     \[
     \frac{L}{2} = 26 + 26
     \]

6. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \frac{L}{2} = 52
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( L \):
     \[
     L = 104
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Leo is \( 104 \) years old.<|im_end|>","Marcus is 26 - 5 = <<26-5=21>>21 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve them step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( A \) represent the number of points Azibo scored.
Let \( B \) represent the number of points Bahati scored.
Let \( C \) represent the number of points Dinar scored.

We know that Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo, so:
\[ B = A + 20 \]

Also, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so:
\[ B = C + 10 \]

Since Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar together scored a total of 45 points, we have:
\[ B + A + C = 45 \]

### Step 2: Substitute Equations into Total Points Equation
First, substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (B - 10) = 45 \]
Simplify this equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + B - 10 = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2A + B + 10 = 45 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2A + B = 35 \]

Now substitute \( B \) from the first equation into this new equation:
\[ 2A + (A + 20) = 35 \]
Simplify:
\[ 2A + A + 20 = 35 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 20 = 35 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points.

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To verify, let's find out how much Bahati and Dinar scored.
From the equation \( B = A + 20 \):
\[ B = 5 + 20 = 25 \]

From the equation \( B = C + 10 \):
\[ 25 = C + 10 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ C = 15 \]

Finally, check the total points:
\[ B + A + C = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45 \]

Everything checks out, so our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
\[

To determine how many pages are in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the thickness per page:**
   - We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - The stack of paper is 100 pages per inch.

2. **Calculate the number of pages per inch:**
   \[
   \text{Pages per inch} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Thickness}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Pages per inch} = \frac{100}{1} = 100 \text{ pages per inch}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages for 1.5 inches:**
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness (in inches)}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Vince's total working hours.
First, we need to calculate the total time Vince worked.

- He started at 8:00 AM.
- He stopped at 11:00 PM.

Let's convert these times to a common unit (minutes).

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM:
  - Start: 8:00 AM = 480 minutes (since 60 minutes in an hour)
  - End: 11:00 PM = 23 * 60 = 1380 minutes (from midnight)

Total working time = End time - Start time = 1380 minutes - 480 minutes = 900 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals.
Next, we'll determine how many 15-minute intervals there are in his total working time.

- Number of 15-minute intervals = Total working time / Interval length 
  = 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval
  = 60 intervals.

### Step 3: Multiply the number of intervals by the number of reports stapled per interval.
Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30.

- Total reports stapled = Number of intervals × Reports per interval 
  = 60 intervals × 30 reports per interval
  = 1800 reports.

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Vince stapled a total of **1800 reports** over the course of his workday.<|im_end|>","In one hour, there are 60 / 15 = <<60/15=4>>4 (15 minutes).

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine when Kim went to sleep and when she woke up.
- Kim goes to sleep at 10 PM.
- She wakes up at 6 AM.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Kim slept.
Kim sleeps for 14 hours (from 10 PM to 6 AM).

### Step 3: Calculate the time difference between waking up early and going to sleep.
- She woke up at 6 AM but went to sleep at 2:15 AM.
- The time difference is 6 AM - 2:15 AM = 3 hours 45 minutes.

### Step 4: Convert the time difference into minutes.
- 3 hours 45 minutes = 3 × 60 + 45 = 180 + 45 = 225 minutes.

### Conclusion:
She slept for 14 hours minus 225 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is: **{The final answer is}** 14 hours 35 minutes.<|im_end|>","Out of 24 hours in a day, 10 pm represents 22 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the relationship between measuring spoons (S) and measuring cups (C):**
   - We know that Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of measuring cups.

   Therefore,
   \[
   S = \frac{2}{3} C
   \]

2. **Calculate the initial number of measuring cups:**
   - Given that Jonathan starts with two dozen measuring cups.
   - One dozen equals 12, so two dozen equals 24.

   Thus,
   \[
   C = 24
   \]

3. **Find the corresponding number of measuring spoons:**
   Using the relationship from step 1, we can find the number of measuring spoons:
   \[
   S = \frac{2}{3} \times 24
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   S = \frac{48}{3}
   \]
   \[
   S = 16
   \]

4. **Determine the amount gifted to Pedro:**
   - Jonathan gives away 6 measuring spoons.

5. **Calculate the remaining number of measuring spoons after giving some away:**
   Subtract the gifted spoons from the initial quantity:
   \[
   S_{\text{remaining}} = 16 - 6
   \]
   \[
   S_{\text{remaining}} = 10
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining number of measuring cups:**
   Since there is no mention of any change in the number of measuring cups due to gift-giving, the number remains the same:
   \[
   C_{\text{remaining}} = 24
   \]

7. **Sum up all the remaining items:**
   Combine the remaining measuring cups and spoons:
   \[
   Total = S_{\text{remaining}} + C_{\text{remaining}}
   \]
   \[
   Total = 10 + 24
   \]
   \[
   Total = 34
   \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is **34**.<|im_end|>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the initial occupancy rate
- The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
- Initially, 1/5 of these beds are occupied.

First, calculate the number of occupied beds:

\[ \text{Occupied Beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \]

Next, determine the number of unoccupied beds initially:

\[ \text{Unoccupied Beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily increase in unoccupied beds
Each day, 50 new patients are admitted into the hospital. Since all these patients will be placed in unoccupied beds, we can add this number to the current count of unoccupied beds.

After one week (7 days), the number of new admissions would be:

\[ \text{New Admissions per Week} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \]

So, at the end of the first week, the number of unoccupied beds would be:

\[ \text{Unoccupied Beds After 1 Week} = 800 + 350 = 1150 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after two weeks
Since the pattern continues for two weeks, we need to double the weekly increase:

\[ \text{Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks} = 1150 + 350 \times 2 = 1150 + 700 = 1850 \]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after two weeks is **1850**.<|im_end|>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the total number of emails sent per day:**
   Robyn sends 16 emails per day.

2. **Calculate the number of work emails:**
   According to the information given, seven out of sixteen emails are work-related.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of work emails} = 7
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining emails after subtracting the work emails:**
   Subtract the number of work emails from the total number of emails.

   \[
   \text{Remaining emails} = 16 - 7 = 9
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of emails that are not work-related:**
   The rest of the emails are not work-related.

   \[
   \text{Not work-related emails} = 9

5. **Calculate the number of emails sent to the family:**
   Two-thirds of the remaining emails are sent to the family.

   \[
   \text{Emails to the family} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of emails sent to the boyfriend:**
   Since one-third of the non-work-related emails are sent to the boyfriend, we can find the number of emails sent to him by:

   \[
   \text{Emails to the boyfriend} = \frac{1}{3} \times (16 - 7) = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

So, Robyn sends 3 emails a day to her boyfriend.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

Given that Aliya is 3 years old.

- Since Shawna is three times older than Aliya,
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} \]
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 9 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Shawna's father's age based on Shawna's age.
According to the problem, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - Courtney reported that the audience was 48.
   - Kelly claimed Courtney made an error by overstating the number by 20%.

2. **Calculate the actual number of attendees based on Kelly's claim:**
   - Kelly stated that Courtney overestimated the number by 20%.
   - To find out what 20% of 48 is, we calculate:
     \[
     48 \times 0.20 = 9.6
     \]
   - This means Courtney actually attended 48 + 9.6 = 57.6 people.

3. **Verify if this matches Kelly's statement:**
   - Kelly claims Courtney overestimated by 20%, so we should check if 57.6 is indeed 20% more than 48.
   - We already calculated that 20% of 48 is 9.6, which matches our previous calculation for 57.6.

Since both calculations confirm that Kelly's statement aligns with Courtney's report when adjusted by 20%, we can conclude that Courtney's initial report (48) was correct after accounting for Kelly's correction.

Therefore, the number of people who really attended the concert is 57.6.

{The final answer is} 57.6<|im_end|>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balls were in the bag initially based on the information provided about the relationships between the number of balls each boy picked up.

1. **Identify the relationship between the number of balls each boy picked up:**
   - Let's denote the number of balls Jason picked up as \( J \).
   - According to the problem, Jordan picked up twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan picked up \( 2J \) balls.
   - Jason picked up twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey picked up \( \frac{J}{2} \) balls.

2. **Determine the number of balls each boy picked up:**
   - We know from the problem statement that Jason picked up 2 balls. So, \( J = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the number of balls each boy picked up using the value of \( J \):**
   - Since \( J = 2 \), then Jordan picks up \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) balls.
   - And since Jason picked up twice as many balls as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have picked up \( \frac{J}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) ball.

4. **Sum up the total number of balls picked up by all three boys:**
   - Total number of balls picked up = \( J + 2J + \frac{J}{2} = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is 7.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **First Day**: 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: 8 holes.
4. **Holes Filled In**: 2 holes (to stop digging).
5. **Fourth Day**: Unearthed treasure chest with an aged hat.

We need to find out how many holes were left after the third day but before the fourth day when the treasure was found.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate total holes dug so far**:
   - First day: 10 holes.
   - Second day: 13 holes.
   - Third day: 8 holes.
   
   Total holes dug so far = \( 10 + 13 + 8 \).

   Let’s do the addition:
   \[
   10 + 13 = 23
   \]
   \[
   23 + 8 = 31
   \]

   So, the pirates dug a total of 31 holes over the three days.

2. **Determine the number of holes left after filling in 2 holes**:
   - After filling in 2 holes, the number of holes remaining would be:
     \[
     31 - 2 = 29
     \]

3. **Find out how many holes were left after the third day**:
   - According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day.
   - At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes.
   - Therefore, at the end of the third day, there should have been:
     \[
     10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ holes}
     \]

4. **Verify the calculation**:
   - Since we know that 29 holes remained after the third day and these were filled in to stop digging, it confirms our earlier calculations.
   - If the pirates dug a total of 31 holes and ended up with 29 holes, it means they filled in 2 more holes to reach their goal.

5. **Find out how many holes were dug on the fourth day**:
   - We know the treasure was found on the fourth day, which means they dug all 29 holes from the third day onwards until they reached the treasure.
   - To confirm, since they dug a total of 31 holes over the first three days, and ended up with 29 holes, the number of holes dug on the fourth day must be:
     \[
     29 - 27 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of corn chips that could have been shared.
- We know that three people (Amora, Lainey, and Collins) initially planned to share the corn chips equally.
- However, only two people actually received an equal amount, while one person received 15 more corn chips than the others.

Let \( T \) represent the total number of corn chips.

Since they originally planned to share them equally among all three, if we denote the number of chips each person should have gotten as \( x \), then:

\[ 3x = T \]

However, since two out of the three people ended up getting the same amount and one person got 15 more than the others, let’s consider different scenarios based on who gets the extra chips.

### Step 2: Consider the possible distributions of the extra chips.
There are several ways the extra chips can be distributed:
1. **One person receives the extra chips:** This means the other two people must have received the same amount of chips. Let's assume:
   - One person (let's call them ""Collins"") receives 15 more chips than the others.
   - The remaining two people (Amora and Lainey) must have received \( x \) chips each.

Given this setup, we need to find out how many chips each person has in total after redistribution.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of chips each person ends up having.
If Amora and Lainey end up with 70 chips each, then the total number of chips for these two is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

This sum represents the total number of chips they collectively have before any redistribution.

Now, since one person gets 15 more chips than the others, let's denote the number of chips this person starts with as \( y \). Therefore:
\[ y + 15 = 140 \]
Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = 140 - 15 \]
\[ y = 125 \]

So, this person starts with 125 chips. Since they end up receiving 15 more chips than the others, they will have:
\[ 125 + 15 = 140 \] chips.

Thus, the total number of chips for Amora, Lainey, and this person combined is:
\[ 140 \times 3 = 420 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips was:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the supplies:**
   - The supplies cost $400.

2. **Calculate the additional cost due to ticket prices:**
   - Tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.
   - First, find 50% of the supplies' cost:
     \[
     0.5 \times 400 = 200
     \]
   - Add this amount to the original supply cost:
     \[
     400 + 200 = 600
     \]

3. **Total cost of travel including both supplies and tickets:**
   - The total cost includes the supplies ($400) and the increased ticket costs ($600).
   - Sum these amounts:
     \[
     400 + 600 = 1000
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is $1000.<|im_end|>","He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the unknowns.

Let's define:
- \( A \) = number of Pokémon caught by Alex
- \( S \) = number of Pokémon caught by Stan
- \( D \) = number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolde

We know from the problem statement that:
1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is 339.
\[ A + S + D = 339 \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
\[ A = S + 5 \]

3. Stan has caught 13 fewer Pokémon than 4 times what Adelwolde has caught.
\[ S = 4D - 13 \]

Now, let's substitute these expressions into the total equation:

Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4D - 13 \) into \( A + S + D = 339 \):

\[ (S + 5) + S + D = 339 \]
\[ 2S + 5 + D = 339 \]
\[ 2S + D = 334 \] (Equation 1)

Next, substitute \( S = 4D - 13 \) into Equation 1:

\[ 2(4D - 13) + D = 334 \]
\[ 8D - 26 + D = 334 \]
\[ 9D - 26 = 334 \]
\[ 9D = 360 \]
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Adelwolde has caught 40 Pokémon.

Using \( S = 4D - 13 \), find out how many Pokémon Stan has caught:

\[ S = 4(40) - 13 \]
\[ S = 160 - 13 \]
\[ S = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught **147** Pokémon.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe caught

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of episodes:**
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of episodes.
   - According to the problem, there are ""half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode"".
     - Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can write this relationship as \( E = \frac{E}{2} \times 20 \).

2. **Solve for \( E \):**
   - Simplify the equation: 
     \[
     E = \frac{20E}{2}
     \]
     \[
     E = 10E
     \]

3. **Isolate \( E \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10 (since \( E \) appears on both sides):
     \[
     E = \frac{20E}{20}
     \]
     \[
     E = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show:**
   - Each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the total time \( T \) spent watching all episodes is:
     \[
     T = E \times 20
     \]
     \[
     T = 10 \times 20
     \]
     \[
     T = 200 \text{ minutes}

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total time John spends watching the show is 200 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 200 minutes.<|im_end|>","Since there are half as many episodes as the number of minutes per episode, we perform 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 episodes in total.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance flown by the bird during its migration from the north to the south. We will break down the journey into segments based on the different directions and speeds mentioned.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **First Segment: Southerly Direction**
   - The bird travels for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = \(30 \text{ mph} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second Segment: Northward Direction**
   - The bird then turns around and flies back for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = \(18 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third Segment: Southward Direction**
   - After returning north, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance covered = Speed × Time = \(22 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 110 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Total Distance Flown**
   - Summing up all the distances from each segment gives us the total distance flown by the bird.
   - Total distance = \(300 \text{ miles (south)} + 36 \text{ miles (north)} + 110 \text{ miles (south)}\)
   - Total distance = \(300 + 36 + 110 = 446 \text{ miles}\).

### Conclusion:
The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**. 

Thus, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.

To determine how many individual brownies Greta has left over from the entire day, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Greta’s initial batch:**
   - She made one dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.

2. **Thrown away at the office party:**
   - They gave her half a dozen (6) brownies.
   - This means she was given away 6 out of 12, so she had 6 left after this event.

3. **Throwing away some more during the party:**
   - During the party, 1.5 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.
   - Since she initially had 6, she ate 18 out of those 6 remaining, leaving her with 0 brownies.

4. **Total number of brownies available before the party:**
   - Initially, she had 12 brownies.
   - Then she had 6 left after the office party.
   - So, before the party, she had a total of \(12 + 6 = 18\) brownies.

5. **Number of brownies thrown away during the party:**
   - Half a dozen (6) brownies were thrown away.

6. **Final count of brownies left over from the entire day:**
   - After all events, she had 0 brownies left over.

Therefore, the number of individual brownies that Greta has left over from the entire day is \(\boxed{0}\).<|im_end|>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies

   - Nani is 8 years old.
   - Her brother is twice her age.
   \[
   \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine Nani's sister's age:**
   - Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani.
   - Calculate 25% of Nani's age (8):
   \[
   0.25 \times 8 = 2
   \]
   - Subtract this value from Nani's age:
   \[
   \text{Sister's age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total age of the family members:**
   - Add up the ages of Nani, her brother, and her sister:

<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of stringing based on his average times for each method.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate total time for synthetic gut strings:**
   - Number of synthetic gut strings = 3
   - Time per synthetic gut string = 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut strings = \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Calculate total time for polyester strings:**
   - Number of polyester strings = 5
   - Time per polyester string = 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester strings = \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Calculate total time for hybrid strings:**
   - Number of hybrid strings = 4
   - Time per hybrid string = 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid strings = \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

4. **Sum up all the times to get the total time:**
   - Total time = Time for synthetic gut + Time for polyester + Time for hybrid
   - Total time = \( 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \) minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is **227 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of phones John buys:**
   - John buys for himself, his 2 kids (totaling 3), and his wife.
   - Total number of people = 4.

2. **Calculate the cost per phone considering the discount:**
   - The initial price of one phone is $600.
   - After the first two phones, each subsequent phone is half the original price.
   - So, the price for the third phone would be \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) dollars.
   - For the fourth phone, the price will again be half of the second phone, so it would also be \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \) dollars.

3. **Sum up the costs for all four phones:**
   - Cost for the first phone = $600.
   - Cost for the second phone = $600.
   - Cost for the third phone = $300.
   - Cost for the fourth phone = $150.

   Now add these amounts together:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of players on Zeke's team.
- We know that Zeke's team has . 7! (factorial) more players than Carlton's team.
- The factorial symbol ""!"" means multiplying all positive integers up to that number together.

Calculate . 7! :
\[ . 7! = . 7 \times . 6 \times . 5 \times . 4 \times . 3 \times . 2 \times . 1 \]
\[ . 7! = 5040 \]

So, Zeke's team has 5040 + (number of players on Carlton's team) more players.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of players on both teams.
- Let \( C \) be the number of players on Carlton's team.
- According to the information given, \( C = 13 \).

Now, add the difference between Zeke's team and Carlton's team:
\[ Total \, Players = C + (. 7!) \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the fence.
- The shape of the fence is a rectangle.
- The formula to calculate the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (l + w) \]
where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.

Given:
- Length (\(l\)) = 15 feet
- Width (\(w\)) = 10 feet

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ P = 50 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many wood slats are needed per foot of fence.
- Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fence.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of wood slats required.
- To find the total number of wood slats, multiply the perimeter of the fence by the number of slats per foot:
\[ \text{Total Slats} = P \times \text{Slats per Foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Slats} = 50 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total Slats} = 100 \]

### Conclusion
Robert will need **100 wooden slats** to build the fence around his garden.<|im_end|>","A rectangle has 2 long sides and Robert wants them to be 15 feet long so 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 feet long
A rectangle has 2 short sides and Robert wants them to be 10 feet wide so 2*10= <<2*10=20>>20 feet wide
Together, he will need 30 feet and 20 feet of fencing so 30+20 = <<30+20=50>>50 feet of fencing
He needs 2 wooden slats per 1 foot of fencing and he is building 50 feet of fencing so he needs 50*2 = <<2*50=100>>100 wooden slats

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine how many oranges were initially purchased.
2. Calculate how many oranges were given away.
3. Find out how many oranges were kept for later use.
4. Calculate how many oranges were left after keeping some.
5. Finally, determine how many oranges were sold.

Let's break it down:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges:**
   - Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
   - Each box contains 20 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges = \(12 \times 20 = 240\).

2. **Calculate how many oranges were given away:**
   - Mrs. Harrington gave 2 boxes to her mother and 2 boxes to her sister.
   - Since each box contains 20 oranges, she gave away \(2 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 80\) oranges.

3. **Find out how many oranges were kept for later use:**
   - After giving away 80 oranges, Mrs. Harrington kept \(240 - 80 = 160\) oranges.

4. **Calculate how many oranges were left after keeping some:**
   - She then kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the remaining oranges.
   - The amount kept = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40\) oranges.

5. **Finally, determine how many oranges were sold:**
   - The number of oranges sold = Total oranges - Oranges kept
   - So, the number of oranges sold = \(240 - 160 = 80\).

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 80 oranges. 

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 80.<|im_end|>","Mrs. Harrington gave a total of 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 boxes of oranges to her mom and sister.
She then had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.

So, she had 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 boxes of oranges to be sold.
Hence, Mrs. Harrington sold 6 boxes x 20 oranges = <<6*20=120>>120 oranges.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of states in India.
2. Calculate how many times more states India has compared to the USA.
3. Use that ratio to find out how many states the USA has.
4. Add the number of states in India and the USA.

Step 1: Determine the number of states in India.
India has 4 states.

Step 2: Calculate how many times more states India has compared to the USA.
Since India has 4 states and it has ""more"" than half the number of states in the USA, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{\text{Half of the USA's states}} + 1 \]
Let \( x \) be the number of states in the USA. Then:
\[ 4 = \frac{x}{2} + 1 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[ 4 - 1 = \frac{x}{2} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{x}{2} \]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the USA has 6 states.

Step 4: Add the number of states in India and the USA.
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is **10**.<|im_end|>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the three items:**
   - Dictionary: $18
   - Dinosaur book: $13
   - Cookbook: $8

2. **Sum up all the costs to find the total amount needed:**

\[
18 + 13 + 8 = 40 \text{ dollars}

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherries each person has based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of cherries Jerry has:**
   - We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
   - Therefore, if Robert has 30 cherries, then Richard must have \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.

2. **Calculate the total number of cherries available:**
   - The total number of cherries is 60.

3. **Subtract the cherries already accounted for from the total:**
   - Total cherries: 60
   - Cherries left after accounting for Richard's cherries: \(60 - 20 = 40\)

4. **Determine the number of cherries remaining for Jerry:**
   - Since the remaining cherries (after accounting for Richard) sum up to 40, these are all the cherries that remain for Jerry.

5. **Calculate how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry:**
   - Robert has 30 cherries.
   - Jerry has 40 cherries.
   - Difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry: \(40 - 30 = 10\).

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 10. Robert has 10 more cherries than Jerry.<|im_end|>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.
Richard has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 cherries since Robert has 10 more cherries than him.
Jerry has 30 - 20 = <<30-20=10>>10 cherries.
So Robert has 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 more cherries than Jerry.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Sunny earned over two days, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes sold on Saturday**
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He also sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread.

Let's calculate the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday:
\[ \text{Boxes of apple pie} = \text{Boxes of gingerbread} - 4 \]
\[ \text{Boxes of apple pie} = 10 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Boxes of apple pie} = 6 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of boxes sold on Sunday**
- On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday.
- On Sunday, he also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday:
\[ \text{Total Gingerbread boxes} = \text{Saturday's Gingerbread boxes} + \text{Sunday's Gingerbread boxes} \]
\[ \text{Total Gingerbread boxes} = 10 + (10 + 5) \]
\[ \text{Total Gingerbread boxes} = 10 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total Gingerbread boxes} = 25 \]

Calculate the total number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday:
\[ \text{Total Apple Pie boxes} = \text{Saturday's Apple Pie boxes} + \text{Sunday's Apple Pie boxes} \]
\[ \text{Total Apple Pie boxes} = 6 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total Apple Pie boxes} = 21 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings from gingerbread and apple pie**
- The cost per box of gingerbread is $6.
- The cost per box of apple pie is $15.

Calculate the total earnings from gingerbread:
\[ \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} = \text{Number of Gingerbread boxes} \times \text{Cost per Box} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} = 25 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} = 150 \]

Calculate the total earnings from apple pie:
\[ \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} = \text{Number of Apple Pie boxes} \times \text{Cost per Box} \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} = 21 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} = 315 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for both days**
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from Gingerbread} + \text{Earnings from Apple Pie} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 150 + 315 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = 465 \]

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of $465 for two days. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","He sold 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of sunscreen Pamela needs:**
   - Pamela applies one ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She spends 4 hours outside per day for 8 days.

2. **Calculate the total number of applications needed:**
   \[
   \text{Total applications} = \text{Number of hours per day} \times \text{Days}

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the price of the red car.
Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can represent the price difference as follows:

\[ \text{Red Car Price} = \text{Blue Car Price} - (\text{Blue Car Price} \times 0.4) \]

Substitute the given value for the blue car price ($100):

\[ \text{Red Car Price} = \$100 - (100 \times 0.4) \]
\[ \text{Red Car Price} = \$100 - \$40 \]
\[ \text{Red Car Price} = \$60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of both cars.
Now, add the prices of the red and blue cars together:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Red Car Price} + \text{Blue Car Price} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$60 + \$100 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information provided in the problem:

1. **Emil's Current Age**: 19 years.
2. **When Emil Turns 24**:
   - At that time, he will be half the age of his father.
   - At that time, he will also be twice the age of his brother.

3. Let \( E \) represent Emil's current age (which we already know is 19).
4. Let \( F \) represent his father’s current age.
5. Let \( B \) represent his brother's current age.

We need to find the sum of their ages when Emil turns 24.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Emil's Age When He Turns 24**:
   - Emil will turn 24 at some point in the future. We can set up an equation where his age at that time is given by:
     \[
     E + x = 24
     \]
     where \( x \) represents the number of years after Emil is currently 19 until he turns 24.

2. **Express His Father's Age at That Time**:
   - According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his father. So, his father's age at that time will be:
     \[
     F = 2E
     \]

3. **Express His Brother's Age at That Time**:
   - Similarly, according to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice the age of his brother. So, his brother's age at that time will be:
     \[
     B = \frac{E}{2}
     \]

4. **Set Up Equations for Their Ages at Turn 24**:
   - Since Emil's age increases by \( x \) years between now and turning 24:
     \[
     E + x = 24
     \]
   - His father's age at that time will be:
     \[
     F = 2E
     \]
   - His brother's age at that time will be:
     \[
     B = \frac{E}{2}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - From \( E + x = 24 \), we get:
     \[
     x = 24 - E
     \]

6. **Substitute \( x \) into the Equation for Father's Age**:
   - Substitute \( x \) into the equation for the father's age:
     \[
     F = 2(E + x)
     \]
     Substituting \( x \):
     \[
     F = 2(24 - E)
     \]

7. **Simplify the Equation for Father's Age**:
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     F = 48 - 2E
     \]

8. **Substitute \( x \) into the Equation for Brother's Age**:
   - Substitute \( x \) into the equation for the brother's age:
     \[
     B = \frac{E}{2}

9. **Find the Sum of Their Ages**:
   - Now we have two expressions for the ages of his father and brother:
     \[
     F = 48 - 2E
     \]
     \[
     B = \frac{E}{2}
     \]
   - The sum of their ages when Emil turns 24 is:
     \[
     F + B = (48 - 2E) + \left(\frac{E}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     F + B = 48 - 2E + \frac{E}{2}
     \]
     \[
     F + B = 48 - \frac{3E}{2}
     \]

Since \( E = 19 \):

10. **Substitute \( E \) into the Final Expression**:
    \[
    F + B = 48 - \frac{3 \times 19}{2}
    \]
    \[
    F + B = 48 - \frac{57}{2}
    \]
    \[
    F + B = 48 - 28.5
    \]
    \[
    F + B = 19.5
    \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his father and brother when Emil turns 24 is \( 19.5 \). Therefore, the final answer is:  
\[ \boxed{19.5} \]<|im_end|>","His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.
His brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.

The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Adrianne's initial collection:**
   - Adrianne already has 20 metallic beads from her mother.

2. **Her sister's contribution:**
   - Her sister gives her ten more beads than her mother.
     - Mother's beads = 20
     - Sister's beads = 20 + 10 = 30

3. **Friend's contribution:**
   - Her friend gives her twice as many beads as her mother.
     - Friend's beads = 2 * 20 = 40

4. **Total number of beads collected so far:**
   - Initial beads (mother) + Sister's beads + Friend's beads
     - Total = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90

Therefore, Adrianne had a total of 90 beads.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 90.<|im_end|>","Adrianne received 20 +10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads from her sister.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine Joe's total weight of crawfish caught on Friday.
- Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount.

\[
\text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times 3 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
= 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Joe's total weight of crawfish caught on Saturday.
- On Friday, he caught 12 pounds.
- On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday.

\[
\text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

\[
= 6 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Sum up all the catches over the three days.
- Total weight of crawfish caught over the three days.

\[
\text{Total weight} = 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)}
\]

\[
= 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the total weight into servings based on the given serving size.
- Each serving is 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Serving size}}
\]

\[
= \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}}
\]

\[
= 7 \text{ servings}
\]

### Final Answer:
Joe has **7 servings** of crawfish.<|im_end|>","He caught 3 pounds on Thursday and caught 4 times the amount on Friday for a total of 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 pounds

To determine how many students are leaving early to attend the away game, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of football players in Mr. Roper’s class.
2. Determine the number of non-football players.
3. Calculate the number of cheerleaders among the non-football players.
4. Sum up all the students who must leave early.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Calculate the number of football players:**
   - Total students = 30
   - Percentage of football players = 20%
   \[
   \text{Number of football players} = 30 \times \frac{20}{100} = 6
   \]

2. **Determine the number of non-football players:**
   - Non-football players = Total students - Number of football players
   \[
   \text{Non-football players} = 30 - 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cheerleaders among the non-football players:**
   - Percentage of cheerleaders = 25%
   \[
   \text{Number of cheerleaders} = 24 \times \frac{25}{100} = 6
   \]

4. **Sum up all the students who must leave early:**
   - Students leaving for the away game include:
     - Football players (6)
     - Cheerleaders (6)
   \[
   \text{Total students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early to attend the away game is \(12\).

The final answer is: The final answer is 12.<|im_end|>","20% of the 30 student class are football players so that's .20*30 = <<.20*30=6>>6 students

To find the average size of shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Add the sizes together (Charlie's boots + Sophie's boots).
3. Divide the total sum by 2.

Let's break this down:

Step 1: Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
- Sophie's boots are size 5.
- Charlie's boots are five times larger than Sophie's.

\[
\text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times \text{size of Sophie's boots}
\]

Since Sophie's boots are size 5,

\[
\text{Size of Charlie's boots} = 5 \times 5 = 25
\]

Step 2: Calculate the total sum of their boot sizes.

\[
\text{Total sum} = \text{Size of Charlie's boots} + \text{Size of Sophie's boots}
\]

Substituting the values,

\[
\text{Total sum} = 25 + 5 = 30
\]

Step 3: Find the average size of the boots.

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{\text{Total sum}}{2}

Substituting the values,

\[
\text{Average size} = \frac{30}{2} = 15

                    question:
                    Pat . has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so , she needs to ! leave 1.5 feet between every plant.  Pat already owns 17 flowers.  : Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store,  how : much money will Pat spend at the store to ; fill up her . flower bed?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers required to fill the flower bed, calculate the cost based on the given price per flower, and then add the initial number of flowers Pat already owns.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the width of the flower bed in feet.
Pat’s flower bed is 111 feet long. Given that each flower grows 12 inches wide, convert the length from feet to inches first:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Now divide this by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/flower}} = 111 \text{ flowers} \]

So, Pat needs **111 flowers** to completely fill her flower bed.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total space needed for the gaps between the flowers.
Given that there should be 1.5 feet of space between each flower, we can calculate the total gap space as follows:
\[ 1.5 \text{ feet/gap} \times 109 \text{ gaps} = 163.5 \text{ feet} \]

This means the total space required including the gaps would be:
\[ 111 \text{ flowers} + 163.5 \text{ feet} \]

However, since we cannot have partial gaps, let’s assume we round up or down depending on practicality; but for simplicity, let’s consider full gaps without considering partial gaps further because it simplifies our calculations here. 

Thus, if we ignore partial gaps, the total space needed would be:
\[ 111 \text{ flowers} + 163.5 \text{ feet} = 274.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since we can’t have fractional feet, we’ll take the nearest whole number which is 275 feet.

#### Step 3: Calculate the number of flowers needed to cover 275 feet.
If each flower covers approximately 12 inches (or 1 foot), we can estimate the number of flowers needed to cover 275 feet as follows:
\[ \frac{275 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ foot/flower}} = 275 \text{ flowers} \]

However, since only 111 flowers fit into the 111-foot section, we need to account for the remaining section where the flowers don't fully occupy the entire area. We need to find out how many additional flowers are required to fill the remaining space.

We know each flower occupies about 12 inches (1 foot). So, if we subtract one flower from the total, we get:
\[ 275 - 111 = 164 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many more flowers are needed to cover these 164 feet. Since each flower occupies 12 inches, we divide the remaining distance by 12:
\[ \frac{164 \text{ feet}}{12 \text{ inches/flower}} = 13.666... \]

Since we can’t have a fraction of a flower, we need to round up to ensure coverage. Therefore, we need 14 flowers to cover the remaining 164 feet.

#### Step 4: Total number of flowers needed.
Adding the initial flowers Pat already owns:
\[ 111 \text{ initial flowers} + 14 \text{ additional flowers} = 125 \text{ flowers} \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the total cost.
Each flower costs $6, so the total cost is:
\[ 125 \text{ flowers} \times \$6/\text{flower} = \$750 \]

### Final Answer:
The final amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is \(\boxed{\$750}\).<|im_end|>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day.
Edgar eats 18 pretzels per day.

Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we calculate:
\[ \text{Brother's daily intake} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.
There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by 7:
\[ \text{Total weekly intake for brother} = 9 \times 7 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many petunias and sweet potato vines Katherine needs for her 5 hanging baskets, calculate their total cost based on the given prices, and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of petunias needed:**
   - Each basket contains 3 petunias.
   - For 5 baskets, the total number of petunias required is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

2. **Calculate the number of sweet potato vines needed:**
   - Each basket contains 2 sweet potato vines.
   - For 5 baskets, the total number of sweet potato vines required is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the petunias:**
   - Each petunia costs $3.00.
   - With 15 petunias, the total cost is \(15 \times 3.00 = 45.00\).

4. **Calculate the cost of the sweet potato vines:**
   - Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50.
   - With 10 sweet potato vines, the total cost is \(10 \times 2.50 = 25.00\).

5. **Sum the costs to find the total amount spent:**
   - Total cost from petunias: $45.00
   - Total cost from sweet potato vines: $25.00
   - Combined total cost: \(45.00 + 25.00 = 70.00\)

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $\boxed{70.00}$.<|im_end|>","The petunia are $3.00 each and she wants 3 per basket so that's 3.00*3 = $<<3*3=9.00>>9.00

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soil needed for all plants:**
   - Calculate the total weight of soil required for sunflowers.
   - Calculate the total weight of soil required for carnations.
   - Add these amounts together to get the total soil requirement.

2. **Calculate the number of roses that can be planted given the remaining soil:**
   - Determine how much soil is left after planting sunflowers and carnations.
   - Divide the remaining soil by the number of roses needed per rose to find out how many roses can be planted.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Soil Requirement

- **Sunflowers**:
  - Number of sunflowers = 4
  - Soil required per sunflower = 3 pounds
  - Total soil required for sunflowers = \( 4 \times 3 \) pounds = 12 pounds

- **Carnations**:
  - Number of carnations = 10
  - Soil required per carnation = 1.5 pounds
  - Total soil required for carnations = \( 10 \times 1.5 \) pounds = 15 pounds

- **Total Soil Required**:
  - Total soil required = (Soil for sunflowers + Soil for carnations)
  - Total soil required = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Soil After Planting Sunflowers and Carnations

- **Soil already used**: 
  - Soils used = 27 pounds (total soil required)

- **Remaining soil**:
  - Total soil available = 30 pounds
  - Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Roses That Can Be Planted Given the Remaining Soil

- **Number of roses needed per rose** = 1 rose per pound
- **Remaining soil in pounds** = 3 pounds
- **Number of roses that can be planted** = 3 pounds / 1 rose per pound = 3 roses

### Conclusion
Artemis and her father can plant **3 roses**.

{The final answer is} 3 roses.<|im_end|>","They used 12 pounds on the sunflowers because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount Jessica saves from each paycheck**
Jessica's monthly income is $2,000. She sets aside 25% of it for savings.
\[ \text{Savings per month} = 2,000 \times 0.25 = 500 \]

**Step 2: Determine the cost of one pair of shoes**
Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.

**Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes Jessica can afford with her savings each month**
\[ \text{Number of pairs per month} = \frac{\text{Savings per month}}{\text{Cost per pair}} = \frac{500}{1000} = 0.5 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of pairs Jessica can afford in a year**
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total pairs in a year} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy **6 pairs of shoes** in a year. 

{The final answer is} 6 pairs of shoes.<|im_end|>","She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to consider both the time she spends peeling and the time she spends cooking.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shrimp per minute**

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. We know that she needs to cook 30 shrimp at the same time as she's peeling them. Therefore:

\[ \text{Total shrimp per minute} = 6 (\text{peeling}) + 30 (\text{cooking}) = 36 \text{ shrimp per minute} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many shrimp she cooks in one minute**

Since she can cook 30 shrimp every 10 minutes, she can do this in **one minute** (as given).

**Step 3: Calculate the total time required for peeling and cooking**

Given that she can peel 6 shrimp per minute and she can cook 30 shrimp per minute, she effectively works at a combined rate of 36 shrimp per minute.

So, if she has 90 shrimp to process, we calculate the time needed using the combined rate:

\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90}{36} = 2.5 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take her **2.5 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

Ending Answer: The final answer is 2.5 minutes.<|im_end|>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the temperature changes in two scenarios: without an air conditioner and with an air conditioner operating.

### Scenario 1: Without Air Conditioning
- **Initial Temperature**: Let's assume the initial temperature of the room is \( T \) degrees.
- **Temperature Change Over Time**:
    - For the first 3 hours (low setting), the temperature decreases by 2 degrees per hour.
      \[
      \text{Change} = 3 \times (-2) = -6 \text{ degrees}
      \]
    - For the next 4 hours (high setting), the temperature increases by 3 degrees per hour.
      \[
      \text{Change} = 4 \times 3 = +12 \text{ degrees}
      \]

   Combining these changes:
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = T - 6 + 12 = T + 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]

### Scenario 2: With Air Conditioner Operating
- **Initial Temperature**: Again, let's assume the initial temperature of the room is \( T \) degrees.
- **Air Conditioner Settings**:
    - First 3 hours (low setting):
        \[
        \text{Change} = 3 \times (-2) = -6 \text{ degrees}
        \]
    - Next 4 hours (high setting):
        \[
        \text{Change} = 4 \times 3 = +12 \text{ degrees}
        \]

   Combining these changes:
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = T - 6 + 12 = T + 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]

### Final Comparison
- **Without Air Conditioner**: 
  \[
  \text{Final Temperature} = T + 6 \text{ degrees}
  \]
- **With Air Conditioner**:
  \[
  \text{Final Temperature} = T + 6 \text{ degrees}
  \]

Both scenarios result in the same final temperature change from the initial condition:

\[
T + 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the final temperature is exactly 6 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

### Conclusion
Given that both scenarios yield the same final temperature, there is no difference between the final temperature when considering either scenario.

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 0 \text{ degrees lower}}
\]<|im_end|>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.
It then ran for 4 hours on high, so the temperature dropped another 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 degrees.
It was then turned off for 2 hours, so the temperature rose 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 degrees.
Thus, the final temperature was 6 + 12 - 4 = <<6+12-4=14>>14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

To solve this problem, we need to determine Bill's age at the time he saw the comet for the first time. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine Bill's father's age when he saw the comet:**
   - Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.

2. **Calculate how many times Bill has seen the comet now:**
   - Bill sees the comet twice.
   - Therefore, Bill must have seen the comet once before these two instances.

3. **Find out how long ago Bill saw the comet for the first time:**
   - If Bill saw the comet twice in total, then there must be one interval between these two sightings.
   - The interval between seeing the comet for the first time and the second time is 75 years (the period of comet Halley's orbit).

4. **Work backwards from the current year to find Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time:**
   - Let \( x \) represent Bill's age when he saw the comet for the first time.
   - Since Bill saw the comet twice, the difference in their ages over the last 75 years should equal \( 2x \).
     \[
     x + 75 = 2x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     75 = 2x - x
     \]
     \[
     75 = x
     \]

Therefore, Bill was 75 years old when he saw the comet for the first time.<|im_end|>","Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was 30 years * 3= <<30*3=90>>90 years old.

To determine how many checks Buford writes per year, we need to break down his monthly and yearly activities into their respective components.

1. **Monthly Checks**:
   - Electric Bill: Once per month
   - Gas Bill: Every month (monthly checks)

2. **Quarterly Checks**:
   - Church Check: Quarterly (quarterly checks)

3. **Yearly Total**:
   - Monthly checks = 12 checks/year (since there are 12 months in a year)
   - Quarterly checks = 4 checks/year (since there are 4 quarters in a year)

Now let's calculate:

- Monthly Checks: \( 1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 12 \text{ checks/year} \)

- Quarterly Checks: \( 1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters/year} = 4 \text{ checks/year} \)

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) be the total number of flights to France.
   - Let \( G \) be the total number of flights to Germany.
   - Let \( P \) be the total number of flights to Poland.

2. **Determine Flights to France and Germany for the First Plane:**
   - According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. Therefore, the first plane also goes to France for one-quarter of its flights (since \( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \)).
   - This means the first plane flies \( \frac{F}{4} \) flights to France per day.

3. **Determine Flights to Poland for the Second Plane:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips in total. Since it doesn't fly to any other destination, it must make all 44 trips to Poland.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The first plane flies \( \frac{3}{4} \times \text{total flights} \) to Greece and \( \frac{1}{4} \times \text{total flights} \) to France.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of flights to France for the first plane.
   - Then, \( \frac{3}{4}T + \frac{1}{4}T = \frac{3}{4}(T) + \frac{1}{4}(T) = \frac{4}{4}T = T \).

5. **Relate Total Flights to the Number of Trips to Poland:**
   - The total number of flights to Poland is equal to the sum of the flights to France and Germany for both planes.
   - For the first plane, the total flights to France plus Germany is \( \frac{3}{4}T + \frac{1}{4}T = T \).
   - Since the first plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and it only uses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of its flights to Greece, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}T = \text{flights to Greece}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{4}T = \text{flights to France}
     \]

6. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - We know from the problem statement that the first plane makes 44 trips to Poland, so:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}T = \text{flights to Greece}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{4}T = \text{flights to France}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the number of flights to Greece. Then:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x = \text{flights to Greece}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{4}x = \text{flights to France}
     \]
   - Since the total number of trips to Poland is 44, and the first plane makes 44 trips to Poland, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 44
     \]
     where \( y \) is the number of flights to Germany.
   - From the above equations, we get:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{4}x = \text{flights to France}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{4}{4}x = \text{flights to France}
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we find:
     \[
     \frac{4}{4}x = \text{flights to France}
     \]
     \[
     x = 44 - y
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}(44 - y)
     \]

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4}T = \frac{1}{4}(44 - y)
     \]
     \[
     T = 44 - y
     \]
   - Since \( y \) is the total number of flights to Germany, and the first plane only flies to France and Germany, we conclude:
     \[
","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how long each wolf's howl lasts:**
   - Tobias' howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.
   - Chikote's howl lasts for half the duration of Tobias' howl because he howls twice as long as Tobias.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Chikote's howl} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   - Igneous' howl lasts for half the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls because he howls for as long as their combined howl.

   Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Tobias + Chikote} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Igneous's howl} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Sum up the lengths of all the howls to find the combined duration:**
   \[
   \text{Combined howl duration} = 20 + 10 + 15 = 45 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Convert the combined howl duration from seconds to minutes:**
   \[
   45 \text{ seconds} = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 0.75 minutes. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 0.75 minutes.<|im_end|>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Adam buys trousers**: 
   - Adam spends $30 on trousers.

2. **Adam receives money from his mother**:
   - Adam's mother gives him $6.

3. **Adam receives money from his father**:
   - Adam's father gives him twice as much as his mother.
     - Since his mother gave him $6, his father gives him 2 * $6 = $12.

4. **Calculate total money Adam received**:
   - Money from mother: $6
   - Money from father: $12
   - Total received: $6 + $12 = $18

5. **Determine how much Adam needs to contribute from his savings**:
   - Adam has already spent $30 on trousers.
   - He now has a total of $18 (from his mother and father).
   - To find out how much he still needs to save, subtract what he has from what he owes.
   
\[ \text{Amount needed} = \$30 (\text{spent}) - \$18 (\text{received}) \]

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all four children based on the given information.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( H \) be Helene's age.
   - Let \( A = 3 \) be Akbar's age (given).
   - Let \( L \) be the unknown child's age (Alessandro or Wilfred).

2. **Calculate the average age of the group:**
   The average age of the group is calculated by dividing the total sum of their ages by the number of children in the group. Given that the total age of the children is 20:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}}
\]

Given there are 4 children, the average age can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{H + A + L}{4}
\]

Since the average age is also stated to be twice as old as Helene's age:

\[
\text{Average age} = 2H
\]

Equating these two expressions for the average age gives us:

\[
2H = \frac{H + A + L}{4}
\]

Substitute \( A = 3 \):

\[
2H = \frac{H + 3 + L}{4}
\]

Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:

\[
8H = H + 3 + L
\]

Rearrange to isolate \( L \):

\[
7H = L + 3
\]

Solve for \( L \):

\[
L = 7H - 3
\]

3. **Use the total age constraint:**

We know the total age of the children is 20:

\[
H + A + L = 20
\]

Substitute \( A = 3 \) and \( L = 7H - 3 \):

\[
H + 3 + (7H - 3) = 20
\]

Simplify:

\[
H + 3 + 7H - 3 = 20
\]
\[
8H = 20
\]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[
H = 2.5
\]

4. **Determine the ages of the other children:**

Using \( H = 2.5 \), find \( L \):

\[
L = 7(2.5) - 3
\]
\[
L = 17.5 - 3
\]
\[
L = 14.5
\]

Now, verify the ages sum up to 20:

- Akbar: \( 3 \)
- Alessandro: \( 4 \)
- Helene: \( 2.5 \)
- Wilfred: \( 14.5 \)

Summing them up:

\[
3 + 4 + 2.5 + 14.5 = 25
\]

This does not match the given total age of 20. Therefore, there must have been an error in assuming one of the children’s ages was wrong.

Revising the calculation, let's re-evaluate:

Given \( L = 7H - 3 \), if \( H = 2.5 \):

\[
L = 7(2.5) - 3
\]
\[
L = 17.5 - 3
\]
\[
L = 14.5
\]

Rechecking:

If \( H = 2.5 \), then:

\[
L = 7(2.5) - 3
\]
\[
L = 17.5 - 3
\]
\[
L = 14.5
\]

Summing correctly:

\[
3 + 4 + 2.5 + 14.5 = 25
\]

Therefore, recalculating, since the total age should be 20, it indicates an inconsistency due to incorrect assumptions.

Correcting, if Helene is older than expected, her age would need adjustment accordingly.

Final check:

Given correct ages:
\[
3 + 4 + 2.5 + 14.5 = 25
\]

Thus, the corrected age calculations do not fit the constraints.

Conclusion: Re-evaluations are needed. Final answer remains consistent with current calculations, but further verification required for accuracy.<|im_end|>","If the combined age of the children is 20, the average age of the group is 20 years / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 years.
Helene is twice as old as the group's average age, meaning Helene is 2 * 5 years = <<2*5=10>>10 years old.
The total age of the three children is 10 years + 3 years + 4 years = <<10+3+4=17>>17 years.
Wilfred's age is 20 years - 17 years = <<20-17=3>>3 years.

                    question:
                    Walter is ? collecting ! money for : charity. First ! he collects . $500 from . his neighbors. . Then he collects $1500 ; from : a fund : he set up online.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Identify the total amount collected so far.
- Walter has already collected $500 from his neighbors.
- He also has $1500 from a fund he set up online.

So, the total amount collected so far is:
\[ \$500 + \$1500 = \$2000 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate.
- Walter's lawyer offers to donate ""three times as much"" as what everyone else (including Walter) contributes.

Since we know the contributions from the neighbors ($500) and the online fund ($1500), let's denote these amounts as \(A\) and \(B\), respectively:
\[ A = \$500 \]
\[ B = \$1500 \]

The lawyer's donation would be:
\[ L = 3(A + B) \]

Substitute \(A\) and \(B\) into the equation:
\[ L = 3(\$500 + \$1500) \]
\[ L = 3(\$2000) \]
\[ L = \$6000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after accounting for the lawyer’s contribution.
- After the lawyer’s contribution, the remaining amount is:
\[ Remaining = Total - Lawyer's Contribution \]
\[ Remaining = \$2000 - \$6000 \]

This results in a negative number because it's not possible to subtract more than the total amount collected:
\[ Remaining = -\$4000 \]

### Conclusion:
Walter's lawyer will only be able to contribute a maximum of $6000. Since he has contributed $6000, which exceeds the total amount collected, there won't be any additional funds available for Walter's lawyer to donate beyond this amount.

Therefore, Walter's lawyer cannot contribute any further towards the charity.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6000.<|im_end|>","Walter collects $500 + $1500 + $200 = $<<500+1500+200=2200>>2,200 he collects from everyone for charity.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Cookies at the Wedding Reception
First, let's determine the total number of cookies distributed during the wedding reception.
- There were 100 guests at the wedding.
- Each guest brought a plate containing 15 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total Cookies} = \text{Number of Guests} \times \text{Cookies per Guest} \]
\[ \text{Total Cookies} = 100 \times 15 \]

Let's do the multiplication:

\[ 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

Thus, there were **1500 cookies** distributed at the wedding.

### Step 2: Determine How Many Cookies Were Given to the Church
Next, we need to find out how many cookies were given to the church.
- The bride gave half of the cookies to the church.

So, the number of cookies given to the church is:
\[ \text{Cookies Given to Church} = \frac{\text{Total Cookies}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Cookies Given to Church} = \frac{1500}{2} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \]

Therefore, **750 cookies** were given to the church.

### Step 3: Determine How Many People Received Cookies from the Church
Now, we know that each person in the church received 15 cookies.
- We need to calculate the number of people who received these cookies.

So, the number of people in the church can be found using the equation:
\[ \text{People in Church} = \frac{\text{Cookies Given to Church}}{\text{Cookies per Person}} \]
\[ \text{People in Church} = \frac{750}{15} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{750}{15} = 50 \]

Hence, **50 people** were in the church.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]<|im_end|>","If each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies, then the total number of cookies brought is 100*15 = <<100*15=1500>>1500 cookies.

If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, then there were 750/15 = <<750/15=50>>50 people.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the ratio of slices:**
   - Let \( x \) be the volume of one slice for an adult.
   - Each adult slice must be twice as large as each child slice.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - There are 6 people in total.
   - Adults = 2
   - Kids = 4
   - Total slices needed = 6

3. **Calculate the total volume of watermelon:**
   - Since each adult slice is twice as big as a kid’s slice, we can represent the volumes as follows:
     - Adult slice size = \( 2x \)
     - Kid’s slice size = \( x \)

4. **Set up the equation for the total volume:**
   - The total volume of watermelon should equal the sum of all slices:
     \[
     \text{Total volume} = (\text{Number of adults} + \text{Number of kids}) \times \text{Volume per adult}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Total volume} = (2 + 4) \times (2x + x)
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \text{Total volume} = 6 \times (3x) = 18x
     \]

5. **Find the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - Each adult gets slices from both children and adults.
   - Number of slices per adult = 2
   - Volume of watermelon per adult = \( 2x \)

6. **Calculate the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets:**
   - Percentage of watermelon each adult gets:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume per adult}}{\text{Total volume}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]
     Substitute the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2x}{18x} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{2}{18} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{1}{9} \right) \times 100\% \approx 11.11\%
     \]

Therefore, each adult gets approximately **11.11%** of the watermelon.<|im_end|>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage
The percentages have to sum up to 100 so 2x+2x = 100 (after simplification)
x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts and calculate step-by-step.

1. **Calculate total time spent on rounds**:
   - Rounds: \(2 \times 0.3\) (since there are 10 patients, but we need to account for the rounding up).
   
\[
2 \text{ rounds} \times 0.3 \text{ hours/round} = 0.6 \text{ hours}
\]

2. **Calculate total time spent on appointments**:
   - Appointments: \(10 \times 0.5\) (since each appointment lasts 30 minutes).

\[
10 \text{ appointments} \times 0.5 \text{ hour/appointment} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

3. **Total time spent on all tasks**:

\[
0.6 \text{ hours (rings)} + 5 \text{ hours (appointments)} = 5.6 \text{ hours}
\]

4. **Subtract the time already spent from the total available time**:

\[
9 \text{ hours} - 5.6 \text{ hours} = 3.4 \text{ hours remaining}
\]

Therefore, after accounting for all the tasks, Doctor Jones will have approximately 3.4 hours left to update his records.

End result: The final answer is: \(\boxed{3.4}\) hours.<|im_end|>","Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients, so his rounds will take 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes.
He has ten appointments, which will take 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes.
The rounds and appointments will take 180 + 300 = <<180+300=480>>480 minutes total.
An hour is 60 minutes, so rounds and appointments will take 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours.
Doctor Jones will have 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the latest time Jordan should start making the cake, let's break down the total time required:

1. **Time for baking**: 30 minutes (from reading instructions)
2. **Cooling time**: 2 hours (which is 120 minutes)

Total baking time = Baking + Cooling 
= 30 minutes + 120 minutes
= 150 minutes

Now we need to convert this total time into hours since the target serving time is given in hours.

150 minutes ÷ 60 = 2.5 hours

So, the cake will take 2.5 hours from the moment it starts baking until it’s done cooling and frosting.

Jordan wants the cake served by 5:00 PM. Therefore, the cake needs to be completed within 2.5 hours before noon (12:00 PM).

Let's calculate how many hours ago that is from now:

From 5:00 PM - 2.5 hours = 2:30 PM 

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:30 PM.

**Final Answer:** Jordan can start making the cake as late as 2:30 PM to ensure it’s ready by 5:00 PM.<|im_end|>","1 hour is 60 minutes so we know that 2 hours to cool the cake is the same as 2*60 so <<2*60=120>>120 min

To determine how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Lisa:**
   - Lisa sold 3 full boxes and 0.5 (half) boxes.
   - Total boxes = 3 + 0.5 = 3.5 boxes.

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold by Peter:**
   - Peter sold 4 full boxes and 0.5 (half) boxes.
   - Total boxes = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 boxes.

3. **Add up all the boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter:**
   - Combined total boxes = 3.5 (Lisa's boxes) + 4.5 (Peter's boxes)
   - Combined total boxes = 8 boxes.

4. **Determine the total number of chocolate bars sold by combining both sales:**
   - We know they sold 64 chocolate bars together.

5. **Calculate the average number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Average chocolate bars per box = Total chocolate bars / Combined total boxes
   - Average chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8 = 8 chocolate bars.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 8 chocolate bars in a box.<|im_end|>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for one session
- The total cost per session includes both the rental fee and the per-student fee.
- Per-student fee = $1.50 per session
- Rental fee = $25 per session

Total cost per session = $1.50 + $25 = $26.50

### Step 2: Determine how many sessions are held per week
- The dance studio rents for 3 days a week.

Let's denote the number of sessions as 'n'.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all sessions in a week
- Total cost for n sessions = n * $26.50

Since we don't know the exact number of sessions (n), we can express the weekly cost as follows:
\[ \text{Weekly Cost} = n \times \$26.50 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly cost
- There are typically 4 weeks in a month.

So, the monthly cost would be:
\[ \text{Monthly Cost} = (\text{Weekly Cost}) \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Monthly Cost} = (n \times \$26.50) \times 4 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from the dance studio
- We need to find out how many students there will be if they continue to attend at the same rate.
- Let’s assume that the current number of students is sufficient for the next few months.

Given that currently there are 10 students and assuming no change in attendance, we'll use this figure.

### Step 6: Calculate the total revenue
- Revenue per session = $25 (per session)
- Number of sessions per week = 3
- Monthly attendance = 10 students

Revenue per week = 10 students * $25/session = $250 per week
Revenue per month = $250/week * 4 weeks/month = $1000/month

### Final Answer:
The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$1000**.<|im_end|>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box for both Peter and Martha.

2. **Calculate Total Number of Boxes:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes.
   - Martha has 7 boxes.

3. **Calculate Total Chocolate Bars for Each Person:**
   - Peter's total chocolate bars = \( 4x \)
   - Martha's total chocolate bars = \( 7x \)

4. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Totals:**
   According to the problem, the combined total chocolate bars for both is 64:
   \[
   4x + 7x = 64
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   11x = 64
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{64}{11} \approx 5.818
   \]
   Since \( x \) must be an integer (as we're dealing with whole chocolate bars), we need to re-evaluate our approach because the given conditions might not allow for such fractional chocolates per box. However, if we assume that the chocolate bars can be split or distributed as needed, we'll proceed with the calculation based on the total chocolate bars provided.

6. **Calculate Chocolate Bars Per Box for Each Person:**
   - For Peter: 
     \[
     \text{Chocolate bars per box} = \frac{x}{4}
     \]
   - For Martha:
     \[
     \text{Chocolate bars per box} = \frac{x}{7}
     \]

7. **Determine How Many More Chocolate Bars Peter Has Than Martha:**
   - Difference in chocolate bars per box:
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} - \frac{x}{7} = x \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{7} \right) = x \left( \frac{7-4}{28} \right) = x \left( \frac{3}{28} \right)
     \]
   - Since \( x \approx 5.818 \):
     \[
     \frac{3}{28} \times 5.818 \approx 0.999
     \]

Therefore, Peter has approximately 1 more chocolate bar per box than Martha.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Peter has approximately 1 more chocolate bar per box than Martha.<|im_end|>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box
Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 equal boxes so there are 56/7 = <<56/7=8>>8 bars in each box
Peter has 16-8 = <<16-8=8>>8 bars more than Martha in each box

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the number of female porcupines.
2. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born per month.
3. Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born over the course of one year.
4. Add these newborns to the original population.

**Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines**

Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate it as follows:
\[ \text{Number of females} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born per month**

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, for all the females:
\[ \text{Total monthly births} = 4 \times 30 = 120 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of baby porcupines born over the course of one year**

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year would be:
\[ \text{Total yearly births} = 120 \times 12 = 1440 \]

**Step 4: Add these newborns to the original population**

Initially, there are 50 porcupines. Adding the new babies born during the year gives us:
\[ \text{Final population} = 50 + 1440 = 1490 \]

Therefore, after a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be **1490**.<|im_end|>","The number of female porcupines in the park is 3/5*50 = <<3/5*50=30>>30.

After a year, with 12 months, the total number of new porcupines in the park is 120*12 = <<120*12=1440>>1440
The total population of porcupines in the park after a year is 50+1440 = <<50+1440=1490>>1490

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool**

- **Volume formula**: \( \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \)

Given dimensions:
- Length (L) = 25 feet
- Width (W) = 14 feet
- Depth (D) = 4 feet

Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 140 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 560 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert cubic feet to gallons**

We know that there are approximately 7.5 gallons in one cubic foot.

So,

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{\text{Volume in cubic feet}}{7.5} \]

Substituting our calculated volume:

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = \frac{560}{7.5} \]

\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 75.333\ldots \approx 75.33 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Given that the cost is $0.10 per gallon, we can now compute the total cost:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 75.33 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 7.533 \ldots \]

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool will be approximately **$7.53**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

<|im_start|>superior
To determine the number of female students at Brook Hills High School, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students who are 16 or older.
Given that half of the students are over 16 years old:
\[ \text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of males among those over 16 years old.
We know that one-fourth of the students over 16 are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of females among those over 16 years old.
Since the total number of students over 16 is 1500, and 375 of them are male:
\[ \text{Number of female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students who are 16 or younger.
This can be found by subtracting the number of students over 16 from the total student population:
\[ \text{Number of students 16 or younger} = 3000 - 1500 = 1500 \]

### Step 5: Determine the number of males among those 16 or younger.
Given that one-half of the students under 16 are male:
\[ \text{Number of male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the number of females among those 16 or younger.
Since the total number of students under 16 is 1500, and 750 of them are male:
\[ \text{Number of female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]

### Step 7: Add the number of females in both age groups to get the total number of female students at the school.
\[ \text{Total number of female students} = 1125 (over 16) + 750 (under 16) = 1875 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water remains in the tank after both days of pumping. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total volume of water pumped on the first day.
Wanda pumped \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank’s capacity, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda did, so Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

Total water pumped on the first day = \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

### Step 2: Determine the total volume of water pumped on the second day.
On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

Total water pumped on the second day = \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume of water pumped over the two days.
Total water pumped over the two days = \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons.

### Step 4: Determine the volume of water left in the tank.
Since the tank initially had no water, all the water pumped over the two days fills up the tank completely. Therefore, the remaining volume of water in the tank is:

\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons} \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The tank will have 6000 gallons of water remaining for it to be full.<|im_end|>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial charge level of the power bank based on the information provided.

1. **Initial Charge Level Calculation:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity every hour.
   - After 5 hours, the battery starts losing 7% of its total capacity per hour instead.
   - At the end, the remaining charge is 28%.

Let's denote the initial full charge as \( C \).

Given that after 5 hours, the remaining charge is 28%, we can set up the equation:
\[ (C - 0.09C) \times 5 = 0.28C \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 0.91C \times 5 = 0.28C \]
\[ 4.55C = 0.28C \]

From this, we can see that:
\[ C = \frac{4.55}{0.28} \approx 16.25 \text{ units} \]

So, the initial charge level of the power bank when Maria went out to the park is approximately **16.25 units**.<|im_end|>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Weekly Wages
Janet earns both hourly wage and tip earnings.

- Hourly wage = $10/hour * 40 hours/week = $400 per week.
- Tip earnings = $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600 per week.

Total weekly earnings = Hourly wage + Tips
= $400 + $600 = $1000 per week.

### Step 2: Determine the Down Payment Required
Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car.

Down payment required = 20% of $10,000
= 0.20 * $10,000 = $2,000.

### Step 3: Calculate Number of Weeks Needed
To find out how many weeks she needs to work to reach her goal, divide the total amount needed by her weekly earnings.

Number of weeks needed = Down payment / Weekly earnings
= $2,000 / $1,000 per week
= 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for **2** weeks to save enough money to make a down payment on the car.<|im_end|>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Jamaar has after purchasing the fruits.
2. Determine the cost of one plum based on the given prices for other fruits.
3. Calculate how many plums he can afford.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Jamaar has**

Jamaar starts with $10. He buys peaches at $0.5 each, pears at $0.5 each, kiwis at $1 each, and apples at $0.75 each. Let's calculate the cost of these items:

- Peaches: 3 peaches * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis * $1 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples * $0.75 = $3.75

Total spent so far = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

So, Jamaar still needs to spend $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 more to reach his goal.

**Step 2: Determine the cost of one plum**

Given that peaches cost $0.5 each, pears also cost $0.5 each, and apples cost $0.75 each, we can infer that plums must be cheaper than either peaches or apples. The only fruit left is plums, which costs $0.25 each.

Let's assume the cost of one plum is \( C \). Since plums are cheaper than apples ($0.75), and considering the prices of other fruits, it makes sense that plums would cost less than apples but not as much as peaches or pears.

For simplicity, let's assume the cost of one plum is $0.20 (since it's cheaper than peaches but more expensive than pears).

**Step 3: Calculate how many plums he can afford**

Since Jamaar still needs $0.75 to reach his goal, and each plum costs $0.20, he can buy:

\[
\text{Number of plums} = \frac{\$0.75}{\$0.20} = 3.75
\]

Since he cannot buy a fraction of a plum, he can buy 3 whole plums.

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is **3**.<|im_end|>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5
He has spent $2 on kiwis because 2 x 1 = <<2*1=2>>2

He has already spent $9.25 because 3.5 + 2 + 3.75 = <<3.5+2+3.75=9.25>>9.25
He can buy three plums because .75 / .25 = <<.75/.25=3>>3

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of sweets in one pack.
Each pack contains 60 sweets.

### Step 2: Determine how many packs Anne keeps for herself.
Anne keeps 2 packs.

### Step 3: Calculate how many packs Anne gives away.
Since she has a total of 15 packs and keeps 2 packs, she gives away \(15 - 2 = 13\) packs.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of sweets given away.
Each of the 13 packs contains 60 sweets, so the total number of sweets given away is \(13 \times 60\).

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[13 \times 60 = 780\]

So, Anne gives away 780 sweets.

### Step 5: Subtract the sweets Anne keeps from the total number of sweets.
Anne keeps 2 packs, each containing 60 sweets, so she keeps:
\[2 \times 60 = 120\]
Therefore, the number of sweets left after she keeps some is:
\[780 - 120 = 660\]

### Step 6: Divide the remaining sweets among her 10 friends.
Anne wants to distribute the remaining 660 sweets equally among her 10 friends. So we divide 660 by 10:
\[660 \div 10 = 66\]

Thus, each friend receives 66 sweets.

### Final Answer:
Each of Anne's friends received 66 pieces of sweets. {The final answer is} 66.<|im_end|>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To determine the price of carrots after three years, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the annual increase factor.
The price of carrots increases by 5% annually. This means we multiply the current price by 1.05 (since 1 + 5/100 = 1.05).

### Step 2: Calculate the price for each year.
Let's denote the initial price as \( P_0 \), which is given as $120.

- **After one year**: 
  \[
  P_1 = P_0 \times 1.05
  \]
  Substituting the value:
  \[
  P_1 = 120 \times 1.05 = 126
  \]

- **After two years**:
  \[
  P_2 = P_1 \times 1.05
  \]
  Substituting the value:
  \[
  P_2 = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30
  \]

- **After three years**:
  \[
  P_3 = P_2 \times 1.05
  \]
  Substituting the value:
  \[
  P_3 = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 140.715
  \]

### Step 3: Round to the nearest integer.
Since the problem asks us to round to the nearest integer, we look at the decimal part of the result. If the digit after the decimal point is 5 or greater, we round up; otherwise, we round down.

- The third year’s price is approximately $140.715$. When rounded to the nearest integer, this becomes $141$.

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years will be $\boxed{141}$.<|im_end|>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Pictures Uploaded:**
   Olivia uploaded 72 pictures in total.

2. **Pictures per Album:**
   She placed the same number of pictures into 8 albums.

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total Pictures}}{\text{Number of Albums}} = \frac{72}{8}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = 9
   \]

3. **Selfies Only Albums:**
   Out of the 8 albums, 3 albums contained only selfies.

4. **Portraits Albums:**
   The remaining albums (8 - 3) contain both portraits and selfies.

5. **Selfies in Albums:**
   Since there are 3 albums containing only selfies:

   \[
   \text{Selfies in albums} = 3 \times \text{Pictures per album} = 3 \times 9
   \]

   \[
   \text{Selfies in albums} = 27
   \]

6. **Portraits in Albums:**
   There are \(8 - 3 = 5\) albums that contain both portraits and selfies.

   Let’s denote the number of portraits as \(P\).

   From the given information, we know that 2 out of these 5 albums are portraits-only.

   Therefore, the rest must be portraits-and-selfie combinations:

   \[
   P + 2 = \text{Total Portraits}
   \]

   We need to find how many portraits are in those 5 albums where at least one selfie is included.

   Since each portrait album has more than just portraits, let's assume all portraits are in the combination where selfies are present.

   Given that 2 albums are portraits-only, the remaining 3 albums must include portraits.

   Let’s calculate the total number of portraits in these 5 albums:

   \[
   \text{Total Portraits} = 5 \times (\text{Pictures per album}) 
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Portraits} = 5 \times 9
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Portraits} = 45
   \]

   Now, since there are 27 selfies in the albums that contain only selfies:

   \[
   \text{Total Portraits} = 27 + P
   \]

   Solving for \(P\):

   \[
   45 = 27 + P
   \]

   \[
   P = 45 - 27
   \]

   \[
   P = 18
   \]

Therefore, Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies. 

**Final Answer:** Olivia had 18 portraits and 27 selfies.<|im_end|>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.
Olivia had 3 selfie albums * 9 pictures = <<3*9=27>>27 pictures.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long James spends reading after he finishes 18 pages. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the time it takes for James to read one page.
James takes 10 minutes to read 3 pages.

Therefore, the time taken to read one page can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of pages}} \]
\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} \]
\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes/page} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages James has already read.
James has read 18 pages.

### Step 3: Determine the remaining number of pages James needs to read.
Since he has already read 18 pages out of the total number of pages in the book (let's call this total \(T\)), the remaining number of pages is:
\[ \text{Remaining pages} = T - 18 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent reading.
Given that James takes \(\frac{10}{3}\) minutes to read one page, the total time spent reading all the pages is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \left( \frac{10}{3} \times (\text{Total pages}) \right) \]

However, since he only needs to read 18 pages initially, the calculation would be:
\[ \text{Total time} = \left( \frac{10}{3} \times 18 \right) \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression.
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{10}{3} \times 18 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends **60 minutes** reading after finishing 18 pages.<|im_end|>","James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - Total questions = 60
   - Easy questions = 40%
     \[
     \text{Easy questions} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
     \]
   - Average questions (remaining): 
     \[
     \text{Average questions} = 60 - 24 = 36
     \]
   - Difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Difficult questions} = 60 - 24 - 36 = 12
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of questions Aries will likely get correct in each category:**
   - Aries gets 75% of the easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Easy questions Aries gets correct} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
     \]
   - Aries gets half of the average questions:
     \[
     \text{Average questions Aries gets correct} = 0.5 \times 36 = 18
     \]
   - Aries gets half of the difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Difficult questions Aries gets correct} = 0.5 \times 12 = 6
     \]

3. **Sum up the total number of points Aries is sure to get:**
   - Points from easy questions:
     \[
     \text{Points from easy questions} = 18
     \]
   - Points from average questions:
     \[
     \text{Points from average questions} = 18
     \]
   - Points from difficult questions:
     \[
     \text{Points from difficult questions} = 6
     \]

4. **Add all these points together to find the total number of points Aries is sure to get:**
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 18 + 18 + 6 = 42
   \]

Therefore, Aries is sure to get a total of 42 points.

{The final answer is}: 42<|im_end|>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.
There are 60 questions x 40/100 = <<60*40/100=24>>24 easy questions.
There are a total of 60 questions x 60/100 = <<60*60/100=36>>36 average and difficult questions.
If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.
Thus, she is sure of getting 18 points + 18 points = <<18+18=36>>36 points in her quiz.

                    question:
                    Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. Today, she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned $120 from the sales. Each small stuffed animal costs $4. , How many small stuffed animals ? did she sell?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( L \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold.
- Let \( S \) be the number of small stuffed animals sold.

### Step 2: Express Relationships Between Prices
- Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, we can express this relationship as:
  \[
  P_L = 3P_S
  \]
  where \( P_L \) is the price per large stuffed animal and \( P_S \) is the price per small stuffed animal.

### Step 3: Determine Selling Price Based on Given Information
We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so:
\[
P_S = 4
\]

Using the price ratio, we find the selling price for a large stuffed animal:
\[
P_L = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

### Step 4: Set Up Equations Based on Sales Data
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, so:
\[
S = 2L
\]

She also made a total of $120 in sales:
\[
P_S \times S + P_L \times L = 120
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation:
\[
4S + 12L = 120
\]

### Step 5: Substitute the Relationship Between \( S \) and \( L \)
From Step 4, substitute \( S = 2L \):
\[
4(2L) + 12L = 120
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
8L + 12L = 120
\]
\[
20L = 120
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( L \)
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
L = \frac{120}{20} = 6
\]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.

### Step 7: Calculate Number of Small Stuffed Animals Sold
Since \( S = 2L \), substituting \( L = 6 \):
\[
S = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals today.<|im_end|>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.
Thus, she sold 2A small stuffed animals.
Large stuffed animals cost 3 * 4 = $<<3*4=12>>12.
She earned 12A + 4 * 2A = 12A + 8A = 20A = $120 from selling stuffed animals today.
Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine daily consumption for each family member:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   - Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

2. **Calculate total weekly consumption for each family member:**
   - Man's weekly consumption: \( 5 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ sandwiches/week} \)
   - Wife's weekly consumption: \( 4 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ sandwiches/week} \)
   - Son's weekly consumption: \( 2 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ sandwiches/week} \)

3. **Sum up the total weekly consumption for all members of the family:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from selling cookies.
- Suzanne sells 80 cookies at $1 per cookie.
\[ \text{Total earnings from cookies} = 80 \times \$1 = \$80 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many cupcakes Suzanne can sell with her remaining budget after giving some to her sisters.
- Suzanne has given $10 to each sister, so we need to subtract that amount from her total earnings.
\[ \text{Remaining budget} = \$80 - (2 \times \$10) = \$80 - \$20 = \$60 \]
- Each cupcake costs $4, so we divide the remaining budget by the cost per cupcake to find out how many cupcakes she can buy.
\[ \text{Number of cupcakes} = \frac{\$60}{\$4} = 15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from both cookies and cupcakes.
- The total earnings include the earnings from cookies and the earnings from cupcakes.
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$80 + (15 \times \$4) = \$80 + \$60 = \$140 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the amount donated to help her sisters.
- Suzanne donates $10 to each of her two sisters.
\[ \text{Amount donated} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]
- Finally, we subtract the donation from her total earnings.
\[ \text{Money left} = \$140 - \$20 = \$120 \]

### Conclusion:
Suzanne has $120 left from her earnings.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Suzzane's revenue from the cookies is 80 x $1 = $<<80*1=80>>80.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs the Smith twins found.
- Each of the two Smith twins found 30 eggs.
- Therefore, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).

### Step 2: Subtract the number of eggs already accounted for (Smith twins).
- Total eggs hidden = 100.
- Eggs already found by the Smith twins = 60.
- Remaining eggs after the Smiths have been factored in = \(100 - 60 = 40\).

### Step 3: Identify who else contributed to finding these remaining eggs.
- We know that all the ""other"" eggs except one were found by the friends.
- Let's denote the number of eggs found by the friends as \(X\).
- Since there are no other eggs found besides those found by the friends, \(X\) must be equal to the remaining eggs after accounting for the Smiths.

Therefore, \(X = 40\).

### Conclusion

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe:**
   - According to the problem, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
   
2. **Calculate how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe:**
   - The problem states that one dwarf can mine ""50% more"" with a steel pickaxe compared to an iron pickaxe.
   - If one dwarf mines 12 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe, then with a steel pickaxe, he would mine:
     \[
     12 \text{ pounds/day} + 0.5 \times 12 \text{ pounds/day} = 12 \text{ pounds/day} + 6 \text{ pounds/day} = 18 \text{ pounds/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much all 40 dwarves can mine together using a steel pickaxe:**
   - Since one dwarf mines 18 pounds per day, 40 dwarves would mine:
     \[
     40 \times 18 \text{ pounds/day} = 720 \text{ pounds/month}
     \]
   - This calculation assumes that all 40 dwarves work for 30 days (one month).

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price per sandwich for the first two packages**:
   - The first package contains 2 sandwiches for $3.
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches in the third package**:
   - The third package has 8 sandwiches.

3. **Calculate the total cost based on the price per sandwich**:
   - Since the price per sandwich remains constant at $1.50, we can calculate the total cost as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Price per sandwich}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich} = \$12

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of the bedroom set after Tom's payment.
Tom initially pays $3000 for the bedroom set.

He sells his old bedroom at $1000 to cover some of the cost.

So, the remaining amount to be paid after selling his old bedroom would be:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$3000 - \$1000 = \$2000 \]

This means Tom still owes $2000 for the new bedroom set.

### Step 2: Calculate how much Tom will pay per month.
The monthly payment is given as 10%.

Therefore, the monthly payment can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \text{Total Remaining Amount} \times \frac{\text{Monthly Percentage}}{100} \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \$2000 \times \frac{10}{100} = \$200 \]

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the changes in the number of balloons over time. Let's break it down step by step.

### Initial Setup:
- **Red Balloons**: 25
- **Green Balloons**: 7
- **Yellow Balloons**: 12

### Step 1: Calculate the number of red balloons that burst.
- A gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst.
- Number of red balloons that burst = \( 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \)
- Remaining red balloons = \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow balloons that were released.
- Half of the yellow balloons were released due to the shock.
- Total yellow balloons before release = 12
- Yellow balloons released = \( 12 / 2 = 6 \)
- Remaining yellow balloons = \( 12 - 6 = 6 \)

### Step 3: Add the blue balloons caught in the tree.
- Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining balloons.
- Blue balloons added = \( 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \)
- Total balloons after adding blue balloons = \( 15 + 6 + 6 = 27 \)

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total number of balloons Sally eventually carries into the school is \(\boxed{27}\).<|im_end|>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal ? extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will need to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Scenario 1: No Substitute Teacher**
   - Probability = 50%
   - If no substitute teacher, there's a 60% chance (100% - 40%) that the regular teacher gives an extension.
     - If given an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate it.
       - If this happens, Marcus does not need to turn in the homework.
       - Otherwise, he still needs to turn it in.

   - Probability for Scenario 1 = \( \frac{50}{100} \times \left( \frac{60}{100} \times \frac{80}{100} + \frac{40}{100} \times \frac{20}{100} \right) \)

2. **Scenario 2: Substitute Teacher**
   - Probability = 50%
   - If the substitute teacher collects the homework, there's a 100% chance Marcus has to turn it in.

Now let's calculate these probabilities:

- For Scenario 1:
  \[
  P(\text{No Extension}) = \frac{50}{100} \times \left( \frac{60}{100} \times \frac{80}{100} + \frac{40}{100} \times \frac{20}{100} \right)
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{50}{100} \times \left( \frac{60 \times 80}{100^2} + \frac{40 \times 20}{100^2} \right)
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{50}{100} \times \left( \frac{4800}{10000} + \frac{800}{10000} \right)
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{50}{100} \times \left( \frac{5600}{10000} \right)
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{50}{100} \times 0.56
  \]
  \[
  = 0.28
  \]

- For Scenario 2:
  \[
  P(\text{No Extension | Substitute}) = \frac{50}{100}
  \]

Adding both probabilities together gives us the total probability that Marcus will need to turn in his homework:
\[
P(\text{Need to Turn In Homework}) = P(\text{No Extension}) + P(\text{No Extension | Substitute})
\]
\[
= 0.28 + 0.5
\]
\[
= 0.78
\]

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will need to turn in his homework tomorrow is **78%**.<|im_end|>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%
Then find the chance the teacher doesn't grant the whole class an extension by subtracting the chance she does from 100%: 100% - 40% = 60%
Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3
Now multiply that probability by the probability Marcus can't get a personal extension to find the probability he actually has to turn in his homework: .3 * .8 = <<.3*.8=.24>>.24
Finally, multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .24 * 100% = <<.24*100=24>>24%

                    Apple High ? School is holding ? graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for 6000 people.  After accounting for 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty ! attending, how many tickets ? would each graduate receive to give to their friends . and family if the tickets are split equally?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of available seats:**
   - The Fine Arts Center can accommodate 6000 people.

2. **Subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty:**
   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300
   
   Total seats reserved = 950 (graduates) + 300 (faculty) = 1250 seats

3. **Determine the remaining seats that can be sold:**
   - Remaining seats after reservations = 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats

4. **Divide the remaining seats by the number of graduating seniors:**
   - Let \( n \) represent the number of graduating seniors.
   - Each senior receives an equal share of the remaining tickets.

5. **Find out how many tickets each senior will get:**
   - Number of tickets per senior = \( \frac{4750}{n} \)

Given that there are 500 graduating seniors, let's substitute \( n = 500 \):

\[ \text{Number of tickets per senior} = \frac{4750}{500} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \frac{4750}{500} = 9.5 \]

Therefore, each graduate would receive 9.5 tickets to distribute among friends and family.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: \(\boxed{9.5}\)<|im_end|>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat given that he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and three times as many small beans as one medium-sized bean.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa eats:**
   - We know that it takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.
   - According to the problem, Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of large beans}
   \]
   Substituting in the known value for large beans:
   \[
   \text{Number of medium-sized beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

2. **Determine the number of small beans Grandpa eats:**
   - The problem states that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating one medium-sized bean.
   - Therefore, if Grandpa eats \( x \) medium-sized beans, he would also eat \( 3x \) small beans (since they are equal).

   Let's find out how many medium-sized beans fit into the total number of medium-sized beans Grandpa eats:
   \[
   \text{Total medium-sized beans eaten} = 150
   \]

   Given that these are equal to 3 times the number of small beans:
   \[
   3x = 150
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{150}{3} = 50
   \]

   This means Grandpa eats 50 medium-sized beans.

3. **Calculate the number of small beans Grandpa eats:**
   - Since 3 small beans are equivalent to one medium-sized bean, and Grandpa eats 50 medium-sized beans:
   \[
   \text{Number of small beans} = 3 \times \text{Number of medium-sized beans}
   \]
   Substituting the value found earlier:
   \[
   \text{Number of small beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]<|im_end|>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

2. Determine her total earnings from the jury pay.
3. Calculate her total expenses related to parking.
4. Subtract her expenses from her earnings to find out her net amount.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Melissa spent on jury duty

Melissa works for 6 hours a day for 3 days. So, the total number of hours is:
\[ \text{Total Hours} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Determine her total earnings from the jury pay

Melissa is paid $15 per day. Over 3 days, her total earnings would be:
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$15 \text{ per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = \$45 \]

### Step 3: Calculate her total expenses related to parking

Each day, Melissa pays $3 for parking. Over 3 days, her total expenses related to parking would be:
\[ \text{Total Parking Expenses} = \$3 \text{ per day} \times 3 \text{ days} = \$9 \]

### Step 4: Subtract her expenses from her earnings to find out her net amount

Now, let's calculate her net amount after subtracting her parking expenses from her earnings:
\[ \text{Net Amount} = \$45 - \$9 = \$36 \]

Therefore, Melissa makes $\boxed{\$36}$ per hour after all expenses.<|im_end|>","First find Melissa's net daily pay by subtracting the parking expense from her $15 gross pay: $15/day - $3/day = $<<15-3=12>>12/day

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of pencils**
- Ted buys 3 pencils.
- Each pencil costs $6.
\[ \text{Total cost of pencils} = 3 \times 6 = \$18 \]

**Step 3: Add the costs together**
- Total spent on books: $48

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the number of bottles:**
   - The width of the driveway is 24 feet.
   - Richard places a bottle every 3 feet.
   - Number of bottles = Total length / Distance between bottles = 24 / 3 = 8 bottles.

2. **Calculate the time for Richard to place each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next.
   - Since there are 7 intervals (from the first to the second, third to fourth, etc., but not including the last), it will take Richard 5 seconds × 7 = 35 seconds to place all the bottles.

3. **Determine the time to drop the candy into each bottle:**
   - Dropping the candy takes an additional 0.5 seconds per bottle.
   - Time to drop the candy in all bottles = 0.5 seconds × 8 = 4 seconds.

4. **Add up all the times:**
   - Time to place bottles + Time to drop candies = 35 seconds + 4 seconds = 39 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Richard a total of 39 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 39 seconds.<|im_end|>","If Richard's driveway is 24 feet long and he puts a bottle of soda every 3 feet, then out of 24 feet total there are 24 / 3 feet between each bottle = <<24/3=8>>8 bottles.

2. Calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese.
3. Add the costs from steps 1 and 2 to find the total amount spent.
4. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money (which is $50) to determine the remaining money.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese
- Price of one pound of Parmesan cheese = $11
- Amount bought = 2 pounds
- Total cost for Parmesan cheese = $11 × 2 = $22

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the mozzarella cheese
- Price of one pound of mozzarella cheese = $6
- Amount bought = 3 pounds
- Total cost for mozzarella cheese = $6 × 3 = $18

### Step 3: Add the costs together
Total amount spent on both cheeses = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of mozzarella
= $22 + $18 = $40

### Step 4: Determine the remaining money
Initial amount of money = $50
Amount spent = $40

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the total amount Jim needs to earn:**
   - Jim has $50,000 in loans over 4 years.

2. **Determine the annual loan repayment:**
   - Each year, Jim repays $50,000 / 4 = $12,500.

3. **Calculate the net increase in earnings per year after accounting for the loan payments:**
   - Before college, Jim earns $25,000 annually.
   - After college, Jim earns $75,000 annually ($25,000 + $50,000).

4. **Convert the loan amount into an annual earning rate:**
   - The total loan amount is $50,000 over 4 years, so the annual interest rate on the loans is (50,000 / 4) / 50,000 * 100% = 2%.

5. **Determine the time required to repay the loan:**
   - We need to find out how many years it takes to pay off the loan at a 2% annual interest rate.
   - Using the formula for compound interest or simple interest calculation, we can set up the equation:
     \[ A = P(1 + rt) \]
     where \(A\) is the future value, \(P\) is the principal, \(r\) is the interest rate, and \(t\) is the time.
   
6. **Solve for \(t\):**
   - Given that \(A = 50,000\), \(P = 50,000\), and \(r = 0.02\):
     \[ 50,000 = 50,000(1 + 0.02t)\]
     Simplifying further:
     \[ 1 = 1 + 0.02t \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[ t = \frac{50,000}{50,000} = 10 \text{ years}\]

Therefore, it would take Jim 10 years to earn the money equivalent to the $50,000 in loans if he did not work during college. 

The final answer is: 10 years.<|im_end|>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year

                    question:
                    Jim is making a comforter for ; his , king-sized bed. He , needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 ? feet longer and 2 ? feet wider than the bed, ; which measures 6 feet long : by 8 feet ? wide. How many square ? feet of fabric does Jim need to buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much fabric Jim needs to buy, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the dimensions of the comforter:**
   - The king-sized bed has dimensions of 6 feet (long) by 8 feet (wide).
   
2. **Add the extra length and width required:**
   - Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.
     - Length increase: \(2 \text{ ft} + 2 \text{ ft} = 4 \text{ ft}\)
     - Width increase: \(2 \text{ ft} + 2 \text{ ft} = 4 \text{ ft}\)

3. **Determine the new dimensions of the comforter:**
   - New length: \(6 \text{ ft} + 4 \text{ ft} = 10 \text{ ft}\)
   - New width: \(8 \text{ ft} + 4 \text{ ft} = 12 \text{ ft}\)

4. **Calculate the area of the comforter fabric needed:**
   - Area of one piece of fabric: \( \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10 \text{ ft} \times 12 \text{ ft} = 120 \text{ sq ft} \)
   - Since he needs two pieces, total area: \( 120 \text{ sq ft/piece} \times 2 = 240 \text{ sq ft} \)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Jim needs to buy 240 square feet of fabric.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the length of each piece of fabric by adding 2 feet to the bed's length: 6 feet + 2 feet = <<6+2=8>>8 feet

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were delivered on each day from Monday to Wednesday. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the postal office delivered 17 more than one-fifth of what was delivered on Monday. Given that 425 letters were delivered on Monday:

\[ \text{Letters delivered on Tuesday} = 425 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 425\right) \]

First calculate one-fifth of the Monday delivery:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]

Now add this to the total for Tuesday:

\[ \text{Letters delivered on Tuesday} = 425 + 85 = 510 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of letters delivered on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the postal office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday. We already know that 510 letters were delivered on Tuesday:

\[ \text{Twice the Tuesday delivery} = 2 \times 510 = 1020 \]

Therefore,

\[ \text{Letters delivered on Wednesday} = 1020 + 5 = 1025 \]

### Final Answer
Summing up all deliveries from Monday to Wednesday gives us:

\[ \text{Total letters delivered} = 425 (\text{Monday}) + 510 (\text{Tuesday}) + 1025 (\text{Wednesday}) \]

\[ \text{Total letters delivered} = 1960 \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered by the post office over these three days is **1960**.<|im_end|>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters

Total = 425 + 102 + 209 = <<425+102+209=736>>736 letters
The post office delivered 736 letters on Monday - Wednesday.

<|im_start|>subject
To determine the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost based on the number of guests who prefer each dish.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for the chicken salad**
- Number of guests wanting chicken salad = 10
- Cost per guest for chicken salad = $6.50

Total cost for chicken salad = Number of guests × Cost per guest
= 10 × $6.50
= $65.00

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for the pasta salad**
- Number of guests wanting pasta salad = 6
- Cost per guest for pasta salad = $6.00

Total cost for pasta salad = Number of guests × Cost per guest
= 6 × $6.00
= $36.00

**Step 3: Add both costs together to get the total amount**
Total amount = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
= $65.00 + $36.00
= $101.00

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is **$101.00**.<|im_end|>","Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.

                    Johnny's dad brought him to watch some horse racing and his . dad : bet money. On the first race, he lost $5. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second , race. How much did he lose on average that day?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and divide it by the number of races.

Step 1: Calculate the winnings from the second race.
- The second race win was $1 more than twice the previous loss.
- His previous loss was $5.
- Twice the previous loss = $5 * 2 = $10.
- So, the win in the second race = $1 + $10 = $11.

Step 2: Calculate the losses from the third race.
- He lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race.
- His win in the second race was $11.
- So, the loss in the third race = $11 * 1.5 = $16.5.

Step 3: Calculate the total losses for all three races.
- First race loss = $5.
- Second race loss (which is the win) = $11.
- Third race loss = $16.5.
- Total losses = $5 + $11 + $16.5 = $32.5.

Step 4: Calculate the average loss per race.
- Number of races = 3.
- Average loss per race = Total losses / Number of races = $32.5 / 3 ≈ $10.83.

Therefore, the average amount Johnny's dad lost on that day is approximately $10.83.<|im_end|>","On the second race he won $11 because 1+ 5 x 2 = <<1+5*2=11>>11

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the total population of South America based on the given information, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of people in one country:**
   - Each country has 5 cities.
   - Each city has 1000 people.

   Therefore, the number of people per country = (number of cities) × (people per city)
   \[
   \text{People per country} = 5 \times 1000 = 5000
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of people across all countries:**
   - There are 26 countries.

   So, the total population for all countries combined = (number of countries) × (people per country)
   \[
   \text{Total population} = 26 \times 5000 = 130,000
   \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, if the entire population of South America were distributed equally among its 26 countries, there would be a total population of 130,000 people.

\[

To find out how much taller Cole is compared to Xavier after growing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Xavier's new height.
2. Calculate Cole's new height.
3. Find the difference between their heights.

Step 1: Calculate Xavier's new height
Xavier originally stood at 4 feet tall. He grew by 3 inches over the summer.

First, convert the original height from feet to inches:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now add the growth to his original height in inches:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

So, Xavier's new height is 51 inches.

Step 2: Calculate Cole's new height
Cole originally stood at 50 inches tall. He grew by 2 inches over the summer.

Adding the growth to his original height:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

So, Cole's new height is 52 inches.

Step 3: Find the difference between their heights
Subtract Xavier's new height from Cole's new height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole's and Xavier's current heights is 1 inch.

Final Answer: The difference between Cole's and Xavier's height now is **1 inch**.<|im_end|>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.

Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person received based on the given conditions.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define the variables for the shares taken by each person:

- Let \( x \) be the amount taken by the first person.
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person did, so they took \( 2(x + 80) \).

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Since the total sum of money distributed among them is $1920, we can write the equation as follows:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
First, simplify inside the parentheses:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[ x = 420 \]

### Step 4: Determine Each Person’s Share
Now that we have found \( x \), which represents the share of the first person, let's calculate the individual shares:

- First person: \( x = 420 \)
- Second person: \( x + 80 = 420 + 80 = 500 \)
- Third person: \( 2(x + 80) = 2(500) = 1000 \)

### Final Answer
The share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\).<|im_end|>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many hours each painter put in, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks.

   First, calculate the total number of days:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 \times \frac{3}{8}
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 \times \frac{3}{8} = 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Convert the total working time into hours:**
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day, multiply the total number of days by 24:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 7.875 \times 24
   \]
   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 7.875 \times 24 = 189 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Divide the total hours by the number of painters:**
   - There are 4 painters.
   - Divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked:
   \[
   \text{Hours per painter} = \frac{189}{4}
   \]
   Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Hours per painter} = 47.25 \text{ hours}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set based on the information given.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.
- The number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set would then be \( x + 4 \).
- The number of tennis balls retrieved in the third set would be \( \frac{x}{2} \).

We know that the total number of tennis balls retrieved over the three sets is 19. So, we can write an equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 19
\]

First, let's combine like terms:

\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combine the \( x \)'s:

\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's isolate the fractions:

\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} = 15
\]

Combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 15
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set.

Now, calculate the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set:

\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is **10**.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.

After one year, the car will have depreciated by 21%, so the remaining value is 89% of its original value.

\[ \text{Remaining Value} = \$20,000 \times (1 - 0.21) \]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression.

\[ \text{Remaining Value} = \$20,000 \times 0.79 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Value} = \$15,800 \]

### Step 6: Repeat the process for each subsequent year until 2010.

We need to repeat the same calculation for each year from 2008 to 2010. Let’s denote the remaining value after \(n\) years as \(V_n\). We know that after one year, the value is reduced to 89% of the previous value.

\[ V_1 = 0.79 \times V_0 \]
\[ V_2 = 0.79^2 \times V_0 \]
\[ V_3 = 0.79^3 \times V_0 \]
\[ ... \]

### Step 7: Generalize the formula for any number of years.

For \(n\) years, the remaining value \(V_n\) can be expressed as:

\[ V_n = V_0 \times (0.79)^n \]

Where:
- \(V_0\) is the initial value ($20,000),
- \(n\) is the number of years since 2007,
- \(0.79\) is the fraction left after each depreciation.

### Step 8: Substitute \(n = 3\) for 2010.

Since we want to find the value in 2010, which is 3 years after 2007, substitute \(n = 3\):

\[ V_3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3 \]

### Step 9: Calculate the result.

Now, calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[ (0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 \approx 0.493 \]

Then multiply by the initial value:

\[ V_3 = 20000 \times 0.493 \approx 9860 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$9860**.<|im_end|>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of books written in English:**
   - We know that half of the books are written in English.
   - There are 50 books in total.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of books written in German:**
   - We are given that 10% of the books are written in German.

   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

3. **Determine the number of books written in Spanish:**
   - The remaining books must be written in Spanish because we have already accounted for the English and German books.

   Since the total number of books is 50 and we've found out about the English (25) and German (5) books, the number of Spanish books can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books})
   \]
   
   Substitute the known values:

   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 20.<|im_end|>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.

So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance between San Francisco and New York City.
- We know that the approximate distance from San Francisco (San Diego) to New York City is about **1955 kilometers**.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days Bernice has already driven.
- Bernice has driven for 4 days.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kilometers Bernice has already driven.
- Since she drives at an average speed of **325 kilometers per day**, we can calculate the total distance she has covered so far as follows:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Average speed} \times \text{Number of days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 325 \, \text{kilometers/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 1300 \, \text{kilometers} \]

### Step 4: Subtract the distance already traveled from the total distance.
- To find out how much more driving is needed, subtract the distance already traveled from the total distance:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance already traveled} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \, \text{kilometers} - 1300 \, \text{kilometers} \]
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 655 \, \text{kilometers} \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 655 kilometers}}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks per day:**
   - Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water Ingrid drinks over 30 days:**
   - Multiply the daily amount (8 cups) by the number of days (30).

\[ \text{Total cups} = 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} \]

3. **Convert the total amount of water from cups to gallons:**
   - We know that there are 16 cups in one gallon.
   
   To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, divide the total amount of water in cups by the number of cups per gallon.

\[ \text{Total gallons} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} \]

Let's do the calculations step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total amount of water in cups:

\[ 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups} \]

2. Convert the total amount of water from cups to gallons:

To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in the number of passengers as they travel between stops. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Condition
- Initially, there are 120 people on the train.

### Step 2: First Stop
- 20 more people board the train.
\[ \text{Number of people after first stop} = 120 + 20 = 140 \]

### Step 3: Second Stop
- After boarding at the first stop, some people get off.
- Twice the number that boarded initially gets off.
\[ \text{Number of people who got off after first stop} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of people remaining on the train} = 140 - 40 = 100 \]

### Step 4: Third Stop
- We are not given any information about how many people board or disembark at the third stop. However, if we assume no additional passengers board (which seems unlikely but we'll proceed), then all passengers remain on the train.
\[ \text{Final number of people on the train} = 100 \]

Since the problem does not specify what happens at the third stop, let's conclude based on the provided information up to the second stop.

### Final Answer
The total number of people on the train at the final stop is **100**.<|im_end|>","After the first stop, 120+20 = <<120+20=140>>140 were on the train.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Alison spent on her athletic gear. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the running shorts
Alison bought the tank top for $10. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.
\[
\text{Cost of running shorts} = \text{Cost of tank top} + \$5 = \$10 + \$5 = \$15
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the original price of the tennis shoes
The tennis shoes were originally priced at $48.

### Step 3: Apply the discount on the tennis shoes
The tennis shoes were on sale for half price.
\[
\text{Sale price of tennis shoes} = \frac{\text{Original price}}{2} = \frac{\$48}{2} = \$24
\]

### Step 4: Apply the coupon to the socks
Alison used a coupon for $2 off the pack of $8 athletic socks.
\[
\text{Discounted price of socks} = \$8 - \$2 = \$6
\]

### Step 5: Sum up all costs
Now let’s add up the costs of everything Alison purchased:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Total amount spent:
\[
\$10 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 = \$55
\]

Therefore, Alison spent a total of **$55** on her athletic gear.<|im_end|>","The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.

<|im_start|>wait
To calculate the cost of installing the tiles on your kitchen floor, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed:**
   - First, determine the area covered by one tile.
   - Each tile covers an area equal to its length multiplied by its width (since the problem states that each tile's side is 1 ft long).
   - Therefore, each tile covers \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ sq ft}\).

2. **Determine how many tiles are needed for the entire area:**
   - Divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area covered by one tile.
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 sq ft.
   - Number of tiles required = Total area / Area per tile = \(200 \text{ sq ft} / 1 \text{ sq ft/tile} = 200\) tiles.

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - Multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile.
   - Total cost = Number of tiles * Cost per tile = \(200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400\).

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor would be $\boxed{2400}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much James pays per year for his insurance after the accident increased the cost by 60%.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the increase in cost:**
   - The normal monthly cost of insurance is $120.
   - The increase due to the accident is 60% of the normal cost.

\[
\text{Increase} = 0.60 \times \$120
\]

2. **Calculate the increase amount:**

\[
\$120 \times 0.60 = \$72
\]

3. **Add the increase to the normal cost to find the total monthly cost after the accident:**

\[
\text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$120 + \$72 = \$192
\]

4. **Convert the total monthly cost to an annual cost:**

\[
\text{Annual Cost} = \$192 \times 12
\]

5. **Perform the multiplication to get the annual cost:**

\[
\$192 \times 12 = \$2,304
\]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many loads of laundry Greg needs per year, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Laundry Loads Per Week
Greg uses clean sheets for 5 different types of beds (4 twin beds + 1 king-sized bed). Each week, he can wash up to 3 types of sheets.

- **Number of sheet types**: 5
- **Weekly washing capacity**: 3 types of sheets per load

Therefore, the number of weekly laundry loads is:
\[ \text{Weekly Loads} = \frac{\text{Number of sheet types}}{\text{Types of sheets per load}} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a load, this means Greg can wash \( \left\lceil \frac{5}{3} \right\rceil = 2 \) loads of sheets per week (since he can't complete more than two full loads).

### Step 2: Calculate Total Weekly Laundry Load
Each load consists of either 4 twin sheets or one king-size sheet.
- **Twin sheets per load**: 4
- **King-size sheets per load**: 1

So, the total number of sheets per load is:
\[ \text{Sheets per load} = 4 \times (\text{Twin sheets}) + 1 \times (\text{King sheets}) \]

Since Greg has multiple types of beds, we need to consider that he might be able to combine loads if necessary. Let's assume he combines all loads into one big batch when possible.

Given his weekly load capacity:
\[ \text{Sheets per week} = 2 \times 4 \times (\text{Twin sheets}) + 2 \times 1 \times (\text{King sheets}) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Sheets per week} = 8 \times (\text{Twin sheets}) + 2 \times (\text{King sheets}) \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Annual Laundry Load
There are approximately 52 weeks in a year.

Therefore, the total annual laundry load would be:
\[ \text{Annual Loads} = \text{Sheets per week} \times \text{Weeks per year} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Annual Loads} = (8 \times (\text{Twin sheets}) + 2 \times (\text{King sheets})) \times 52 \]

### Final Answer Calculation
Let's denote the number of twin sheets as \( T \) and the number of king-size sheets as \( K \).
\[ \text{Total Sheets per Year} = (8 \times T + 2 \times K) \times 52 \]

Without specific numbers for \( T \) and \( K \), we cannot provide an exact numerical value. However, the formula above gives us the relationship between the number of twin and king-size sheets needed annually based on the given information.

If you provide the actual numbers for the sheets required for each type of bed, I can plug those numbers into the formula to get the precise answer. For now, the equation remains as described above.<|im_end|>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

2. **Calculate the total number of movies watched per weekend (Saturday + Sunday):**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of movies watched on Saturday.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many stickers Leo had two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

2. **Calculate the total number of stickers Leo has now:**
   - In the current year, Leo collected 50 more stickers.
   - Therefore, the total number of stickers he currently has is \(100 + 50 = 150\).

3. **Determine how many stickers Leo collected last year:**
   - Last year, Leo collected 50 stickers.

4. **Calculate the number of stickers Leo collected before that (two years ago):**
   - Let's denote the number of stickers Leo collected two years ago as \(x\).
   - According to the problem, \(x\) was half the amount Leo collected last year.
   - Since Leo collected 50 stickers last year, we can write \(x = \frac{50}{2} = 25\).

5. **Verify if our calculation for last year’s collection is correct:**
   - If Leo collected 25 stickers two years ago, then \(100 + 25 = 125\) stickers.
   - However, since we know he actually collected 50 stickers last year, there seems to be an inconsistency here. We need to re-evaluate our approach.

6. **Re-evaluate the information given:**
   - The problem states that ""This! year"" Leo collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year.
   - So, if Leo collected 50 stickers last year, this year he would collect \(50 \times 2 = 100\) stickers.

7. **Recalculate the total number of stickers Leo has now:**
   - Now, including this year's collection, the total number of stickers is \(100 + 50 + 100 = 250\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the daily feeding amount for all cats:**
   - Imma has 3 cats.
   - Each cat eats 60 grams of cat food per meal.
   - There are two meals per day.

   So, the total daily feeding amount for all cats is:
   \[
   3 \text{ cats} \times 60 \text{ grams/cat} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many days the total food will last:**
   - We have a total of 720 grams of cat food.
   - The food lasts for 360 grams per day.

   Therefore, the number of days the food will last is:
   \[
   \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of slices:**
   - There are 4 pizzas.
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).

2. **Calculate the number of slices Jake ate:**
   - We know that Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
   - According to the given information, \( 10 = J + 3 \).
   - Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 10 - 3 = 7 \). So, Jake ate 7 slices.

3. **Calculate the number of slices Silvia ate:**
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.
   - Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) slices.

4. **Verify the total number of slices eaten by all three:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Jake ate 7 slices.
   - Silvia ate 14 slices.
   - The total number of slices eaten is \( 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \).

5. **Check if this matches the total number of slices available:**
   - We calculated there were 32 slices in total.
   - Our calculation shows that they actually ate 31 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31.

**The final answer is:** 31 slices.<|im_end|>","Jake ate 10-3 = <<10-3=7>>7 slices of pizza.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Betsy's part of the meal took. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( D \) represent the number of minutes that Donovan's part took.
Then, Betsy's part would take \( D + 18 \) minutes.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
We know that the total time for the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, the sum of the times taken by both Betsy and Donovan should equal 98 minutes.

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:

\[ 2D = 70 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( D \)
Divide both sides by 2:

\[ D = 35 \]

So, Donovan's part took 35 minutes.

### Step 5: Find Betsy's Part
Since Betsy's part takes 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part:

\[ Betsy's\ part = D + 18 = 35 + 18 = 53 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took **53 minutes**.<|im_end|>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes

The doctor charges her $200 : for the . cast, $300/hour for a . 30-minute visit, $4/pill for 30 painkillers, and $6/hour ; for a , mandatory minimum . of 2 hours of parking.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To calculate the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down the charges into their respective categories: casting, medical services (doctor), medication, and parking.

1. **Casting Cost**: 
   - The casting costs $200.
   
2. **Medical Services**:
   - The charge per hour for the visit is $300, but it only lasts for 30 minutes.
   - Since there is no mention of the duration of the visit in minutes or hours, we will assume that the full rate applies regardless of time spent.
   - Therefore, the total for the medical service would be $300/hour * 0.5 hours = $150.
   
3. **Medication Cost**:
   - The charge per pill is $4, and she takes 30 pills.
   - Total for medication = $4/pill * 30 pills = $120.
   
4. **Parking Cost**:
   - The charge is $6/hour for 2 hours.
   - Total parking cost = $6/hour * 2 hours = $12.

Now, let's add up all these costs:

- Casting: $200
- Medical Services: $150
- Medication: $120
- Parking: $12

Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $582.

Therefore, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is $\boxed{582}$.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of emails James receives per day:**
   - James gets 80 emails per day.

2. **Determine the percentage of emails that require an immediate response:**
   - According to the problem, 20% of these emails do not require a response.
   
3. **Calculate the number of emails that do not require an immediate response (i.e., they are responses):**
   - Since 20% of the emails do not require an immediate response, we can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of non-responding emails} = 80 \times \frac{20}{100}
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Number of non-responding emails} = 80 \times 0.2 = 16
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of emails that require an immediate response:**
   - The remaining 80% of the emails will require an immediate response.
     \[
     \text{Number of responding emails} = 80 \times \left(1 - \frac{20}{100}\right)
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Number of responding emails} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64
     \]

5. **Determine how many days James works in a week:**
   - The problem states that James has a 5-day work week.

6. **Calculate the total number of emails James needs to respond to over his 5-day work week:**
   - Since he responds to all 64 emails required for the week.
     \[
     \text{Total emails responded to} = 64 \times 5
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     \text{Total emails responded to} = 320

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of classes that visited the Science Center over the course of the week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Number of classes visiting: 32

2. **Tuesday:**
   - According to the problem, twice as many classes visited on Tuesday compared to Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \)

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Three times as many classes visited on Wednesday compared to Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 3 \times 32 = 96 \)

4. **Thursday:**
   - 30 classes visited.

5. **Friday:**
   - 25 classes visited.

Now, let's sum up all these numbers to find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center during the entire week.

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}

   - The Glee Club ordered 20 pizzas.
   - They ate 70% of these pizzas.

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas eaten by Glee Club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
   \]

   Therefore, the number of pizzas left for the Glee Club is:

   \[
   20 - 14 = 6
   \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas were ordered for the Football Team:**
   - The Football Team ordered twice as many pizzas as the Glee Club.
   - Since the Glee Club ordered 20 pizzas, the Football Team ordered:

   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the Football Team:**
   - They ate 80% of their ordered pizzas.

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas eaten by Football Team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32

Anthony wants to send out twice as many big coupons as small coupons. Since there are 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:
\[ \text{Number of big coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Step 2: Determine the cost per coupon type.
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents.
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents.

Step 3: Compute the total cost for both types of coupons.
First, calculate the total cost for the small coupons:
\[ \text{Total cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Next, calculate the total cost for the big coupons:
\[ \text{Total cost for big coupons} = 1400 \times 15 \text{ cents} = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, add the two amounts together to get the total postage cost in cents:
\[ \text{Total postage cost} = 3500 \text{ cents} + 21000 \text{ cents} = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Convert the total postage cost from cents to dollars (since 100 cents = 1 dollar):
\[ \text{Total postage cost in dollars} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the small coupons: 700 coupons * $0.05/coupon = $<<700*0.05=35>>35

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Sidney's Sandwiches**:
   - Sidney initially ordered 3 meatball sub sandwiches.
   - He then ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}
     \]

2. **Mark's Consumption**:
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's total (initial + additional) meatball sub sandwiches.
     \[
     7 \text{ (initial)} + 3 \text{ (additional)} = 10 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}

3. **Remaining Meatballs in Sidney’s Sandwiches**:
   - Sidney has 10 meatball sub sandwiches left.
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
     \[
     10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ meatballs}
     \]

So, the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is **40**.<|im_end|>","3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.
After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 remained.
Finally, after Sidney ordered three more sub sandwiches, there were a total of 3+3=<<3+3=6>>6 sub sandwiches.
If each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, then the remaining sub sandwiches contain a total of 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24 meatballs.

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Number of Trucks:**
   - Mr. Hezekiah has 20 trucks.

2. **Number of Tons per Truck:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer.

3. **Total Fertilizer Carried:**
   - To find the total amount of fertilizer carried, we multiply the number of trucks by the number of tons per truck.
     \[
     \text{Total Fertilizer} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Fertilizer} = 400 \text{ tons}
     \]

4. **Fertilizer Delivered Before Mechanical Failures:**
   - After two hours, half of the trucks (since one-quarter have mechanical failures) would still be delivering.
   - Since there were originally 20 trucks, after the first two hours, \( \frac{2}{4} \times 20 = 10 \) trucks would still be delivering.
   - These 10 trucks carry \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total fertilizer.
   
5. **Calculate the Remaining Fertilizer:**
   - The remaining three-quarters of the fertilizer would reach the farmers.
   - Therefore, the remaining fraction of the total fertilizer is \( \frac{3}{4} \).
   - We calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Fertilizer} = 400 \text{ tons} \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining Fertilizer} = 300 \text{ tons}
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of tons of fertilizers that reached the farmers on that day is 300 tons.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{300 tons}}
\]<|im_end|>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

                    question:
                    . Dennis uses 1 pound of butter ! for every dozen croissants that he makes.  He needs to . make 6 dozen croissants.  ?

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of butter needed.
Dennis wants to make 6 dozen croissants.

1 dozen = 12 croissants
So, 6 dozen = \( 6 \times 12 = 72 \) croissants.

For 72 croissants, Dennis uses 1 pound of butter.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pounds of butter needed.
Since 1 pound of butter is used for 72 croissants, we can find out how many pounds are needed for 72 croissants by dividing the total number of croissants by the number of croissants per pound.

\[
\text{Pounds of butter} = \frac{\text{Total croissants}}{\text{Croissants per pound}} = \frac{72}{1} = 72 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the promotion (buy one pound get one half off).
The promotion states that if you buy one pound of butter, you get another half-pound free.

Let's see how many free pounds Dennis gets from buying 6 pounds at full price:

- Full price: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \)
- Free half-pound discount on each pound purchased means for 6 pounds bought, he gets \( 6 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) pounds free.

So, in total, Dennis gets \( 6 + 3 = 9 \) pounds of butter worth at full price.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost based on the full price of butter.
The full price of one pound of butter is $4.00.

Therefore, for 9 pounds of butter at full price:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times 4 = \$36.00
\]

### Final Answer:
It will cost Dennis **$36.00** to purchase 6 pounds of butter.<|im_end|>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter

<|im_start|>sys
To determine the total cost of Kayla's party, we need to calculate both the rental fee and the cost per guest for the party. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of guests
- Kayla invited 25 classmates.
- She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
- She has 13 family members.

Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members)
= 25 + 7 + 13
= 45 guests

### Step 2: Determine the cost per guest
The cost per guest includes the initial $6 charge plus an additional $6 for each extra guest over 20.

Since there are 45 guests in total, we first add the initial $6 cost:
$6 (initial cost)

Next, calculate the number of extra guests beyond the 20 allowed guests:
Extra guests = 45 - 20
= 25 extra guests

Cost per extra guest = $6

Now, multiply the number of extra guests by the cost per extra guest:
25 * $6 = $150

Finally, add the initial $6 cost to the cost for the extra guests:
Total cost per guest = Initial cost + Extra cost
= $6 + $150
= $156

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all guests
Multiply the total cost per guest by the total number of guests:
Total cost = Cost per guest * Number of guests
= $156 * 45
= $6990

### Final Answer
The total cost of the party is **$6990**.<|im_end|>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.

Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount each person has initially:**
   - Maggie has $60.
   - Riza has $60.

2. **Calculate how much each spends:**
   
   **Maggie’s spending calculation:**
   - Maggie spends a quarter (1/4) of her money.
     \[
     \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
     \]
     
   **Riza’s spending calculation:**
   - Riza spends one-third (1/3) of her money.
     \[
     \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
     \]

3. **Subtract the amounts spent from their initial balances to find out how much they have left:**

   **Maggie’s remaining balance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining for Maggie} = 60 - 15 = 45
   \]

   **Riza’s remaining balance:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining for Riza} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Sum up both remaining balances to get the total amount left:**

   \[
   \text{Total left} = \text{Remaining for Maggie} + \text{Remaining for Riza}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total left} = 45 + 40 = 85
   \]

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left together is $\boxed{85}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Maggie spent $60/4 = $<<60/4=15>>15.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days for feeding the monkeys.
Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, and they last long enough for three monkeys to be fed for one week (7 days).

### Step 2: Calculate how many bananas each monkey would consume in a single day if they were fed every day.
- Each monkey consumes 10 bananas per day.

### Step 3: Adjust the consumption based on the given information about the differences between the monkeys.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of bananas consumed by the first monkey per day.
- Then the second monkey will consume \( x + 4 \) bananas per day.
- And the third monkey will consume the remaining bananas after accounting for the first two monkeys.

### Step 4: Set up an equation to find the value of \( x \).
Since there are 315 bananas and the monkeys have been eating for 7 days, we can write the equation as follows:

\[ 3x = 315 \]

This equation represents that the total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys over 7 days equals 315.

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \).
\[
x = \frac{315}{3} = 105
\]

So, each monkey consumes 105 bananas per day.

### Step 6: Find out how many bananas the third monkey consumes each day.
We know that the first monkey eats 105 bananas per day, so the second monkey eats:

\[ 105 + 4 = 109 \] bananas per day.

And since the third monkey eats the remainder after the first two monkeys, it will consume:

\[ 105 - 105 = 0 \]

But this seems incorrect because the third monkey must consume something. Let’s correct our approach.

### Correct Approach:
Each monkey should be consuming 105 bananas per day, but let's reconsider the distribution properly.

If the first monkey eats 105 bananas per day, then the second monkey eats:

\[ 105 + 4 = 109 \] bananas per day.

Now, the third monkey must eat the remaining bananas after these two monkeys have finished their portion.

Given that the total number of bananas is 315, and considering the different portions each monkey gets:

- First Monkey: 105 bananas/day * 7 days = 735/3 = 245 bananas.
- Second Monkey: 109 bananas/day * 7 days = 823/3 ≈ 274.33 bananas.
- Third Monkey: Remaining bananas = 315 - (245 + 274.33) = 315 - 519.33 ≈ 195.67 bananas.

Finally, the third monkey eats approximately 195.67 bananas per day.

Therefore, the third monkey eats **approximately** 195.67 bananas per day. 

However, if we assume whole numbers only, the third monkey would eat exactly 195 bananas per day if we round down from the previous calculation. 

Thus, the third monkey eats **exactly** 195 bananas per day.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is: The third monkey eats 195 bananas per day}.<|im_end|>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.
The second monkey eats 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 bananas a day.
So the first and the second monkey eat a total of 10 + 14 = <<10+14=24>>24 bananas each day.
Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many puzzle pieces Teddy placed during the hour, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of puzzles Teddy worked on.
2. Determine how much of each puzzle he completed.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total number of puzzles Teddy worked on:**
   - Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle.
   - Half of 500 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{500}{2} = 250
     \]
   So, Teddy worked on 250 puzzle pieces.

2. **Determine how much of each puzzle he completed:**
   - Teddy worked on two different puzzles.
   - For the first puzzle (the one he finished), let's denote the fraction of the puzzle he completed as \( x \).
   - For the second puzzle, since it was described as ""started and finished,"" it means he completed the entire puzzle, so he completed 100% or \( y \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact fraction for the first puzzle, we can only conclude based on the information given about the second puzzle. Therefore, Teddy completed 100% of the second puzzle.

3. **Summarize the results:**
   - Teddy placed 250 puzzle pieces in total.
   - He completed 100% of the second puzzle, which is 500 pieces.

4. **Find out how many puzzle pieces he placed during the hour:**
   - Since he placed 250 puzzle pieces in total and completed 500 pieces from the second puzzle, he must have placed all 250 pieces from the second puzzle within the hour.

Therefore, the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
\[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $2.
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \times \$2 = \$30
   \]

2. **Determine the amount left after paying with the $5 bill:**
   - Jenny has 5 $5 bills.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \$30
   \]
   
   Since she paid exactly with her 5 bills, she doesn't receive any change from the $5 bills.

3. **Convert the remaining money into quarters:**
   - We know that 4 quarters make up one dollar (since \(1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ quarters}\)).

   Given that she didn't get any change from the $5 bill, the remaining amount must be in whole dollars or fractions thereof. Since she only needs to cover the cost of the roses ($30), which is an exact multiple of 4 dollars (specifically, it's divisible by 4), we can convert the leftover amount directly into quarters without needing additional conversion factors since the remainder would already be a whole number of dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the different items and then sum them up.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling milkshakes.
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33 \]

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling burger platters.
- Terry sells 9 burger platters at $11 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from burger platters} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling sodas.
- Terry sells 20 sodas at $1.50 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from sodas} = 20 \times 1.50 = 30 \]

Step 4: Sum up all the revenues.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 33 + 99 + 30 = 162 \]

Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162 in revenue.

Let's break down the information provided about the trains:

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station, which is 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Leaves the station immediately after the second train arrives.
   - So, if the second train stays for 30 minutes, the third train will leave immediately after the second train has been in the station for 30 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.
   - This means the fourth train will be there for the same duration as the third train, i.e., 30 minutes.

Now let's calculate the total time Paul will wait for his train:

- First train: 10 minutes (arrive) + 20 minutes (stay) = 30 minutes.
- Second train: 30 minutes (first train arrived) + 30 minutes (second train stays) = 60 minutes.
- Third train: 30 minutes (second train arrives) + 30 minutes (third train leaves) = 60 minutes.
- Fourth train: 20 minutes (third train leaves).

Adding all these times together gives us the total waiting time for Paul:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total number of minutes Paul will wait for his train is \(170\) minutes.<|im_end|>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down Melanie's situation into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of toothpicks Melanie needs**

Melanie wants to create a toothpick sculpture that requires 200 toothpicks.

**Step 2: Calculate how long it takes to save enough toothpicks**

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks per week. To find out how many weeks it takes to accumulate 200 toothpicks, we divide the total needed (200) by the amount she saves per week (10):

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total toothpicks needed}}{\text{Weekly savings}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \]

So, it would take Melanie 20 weeks to save enough toothpicks to complete her project.

**Step 3: Determine how much Melanie has already saved**

Melanie has been saving toothpicks for 12 weeks. We can calculate the total number of toothpicks she has saved so far using the weekly savings rate:

\[ \text{Current savings} = \text{Weekly savings} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \]

She has saved 120 toothpicks after 12 weeks.

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining toothpicks needed**

Since Melanie needs 200 toothpicks and has saved 120, she still needs:

\[ \text{Remaining toothpicks} = \text{Total needed} - \text{Current savings} = 200 - 120 = 80 \]

**Step 5: Determine how long it will take to save the remaining toothpicks**

If Melanie continues to save at the same rate, she'll need another 12 weeks to save the remaining 80 toothpicks (since she saves 10 toothpicks per week).

**Conclusion**
It will take Melanie an additional **12 weeks** to gather the remaining toothpicks needed for her project.<|im_end|>","Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.
She needs to save 200 – 120 = <<200-120=80>>80 more toothpicks to reach her goal.
She'll have 80 toothpicks / 10 each week = in <<80/10=8>>8 more weeks.

                    A $2000 watch was put on sale so that Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price. He then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of ? the price that he bought it. What is the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Roger's friend from the original price?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend received, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch.**

Given:
- Original price = $2000
- Sale price (Mr. Rogers) = 75% of $2000

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 0.75 \times 2000 \]

\[ \text{Sale Price} = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers bought the watch for $1500.

**Step 2: Determine the selling price Mr. Rogers' friend purchased the watch for.**

Given:
- Sale price (Mr. Rogers) = $1500
- Selling price (friend) = 120% of the purchase price (Mr. Rogers)

Let \( P_f \) be the purchase price for Mr. Rogers' friend. 

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 1.20 \times P_f \]

We know the selling price is $1500:

\[ 1.20 \times P_f = 1500 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the purchase price (P_f) for Mr. Rogers' friend.**

\[ P_f = \frac{1500}{1.20} \]

\[ P_f = 1250 \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for $1250.

**Step 4: Calculate the total discount in dollars.**

Total discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Purchase Price} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 2000 - 1250 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 750 \]

**Step 5: Determine the percentage discount relative to the original price.**

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{750}{2000} \right) \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = 0.375 \times 100\% \]

\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = 37.5\% \]

Therefore, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is **37.5%**.<|im_end|>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish will be created over a period of time given that there's a spring creating one jellyfish per second.

1. **Determine the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, there are \( 60 \times 60 = 3600 \) seconds in a minute.
   - And since there are 240 minutes in an hour (since \( 60 \times 4 = 240 \)), there are \( 240 \times 60 = 14400 \) seconds in an hour.
   - Thus, for 4 hours, there are \( 14400 \times 4 = 57600 \) seconds.

2. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created:**
   - Since a spring creates one jellyfish per second, and there are 57600 seconds in 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created is equal to the number of seconds multiplied by the rate (which is 1 jellyfish per second).
   - So, the total number of jellyfish created is \( 57600 \).

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 57600 jellyfish.<|im_end|>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between their scores:**
   - Frankie's score is described as ""better more than twice as high"" compared to Binkie's score.
   
2. **Determine Binkie's score:**
   - We know Binkie's score is 90.

3. **Calculate how many times higher Binkie's score is compared to Frankie's score:**
   - Let \( F \) be Frankie's score and \( B = 90 \).
   - According to the statement, \( F > 2B \).

4. **Express the relationship mathematically:**
   - Since \( B = 90 \), we have \( F > 2 \times 90 \).
   - Simplifying, \( F > 180 \).

5. **Substitute Binkie's score into the inequality:**
   - From step 3, we substitute \( B = 90 \):
     \[ F > 180 \]

6. **Consider the given information about Frankie's score:**
   - Frankie's score is greater than 180 but less than or equal to some maximum value since it’s not explicitly stated further.

7. **Since the problem does not provide additional constraints on Frankie's score beyond being strictly greater than 180, we can assume no upper limit for simplicity in calculation:**

8. **Given that Binkie's score is exactly 90, and considering the ratio \( F > 180 \):**
   - The smallest possible score for Frankie would still satisfy the condition \( F > 180 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

   - Since James walked half the distance (which is 2 miles) at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.

3. **Calculate the total time for the entire trip:**
   - James took 0.5 hours to walk half the distance to the store.
   - He then walked back home, covering another 2 miles.
   - Therefore, the total time for the round trip is twice the time it took to go half the distance.

To solve this problem, we need to compare the total cost if Jenny had bought the bananas individually versus in bunches.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas**
Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.
Total number of bananas = Number of bunches * Average bananas per bunch
= 10 * 4
= 40 bananas

**Step 2: Calculate the cost if she had bought them individually**
If she had bought the bananas individually, each banana would have cost $0.80.
Cost if she had bought them individually = Total number of bananas * Cost per banana
= 40 * $0.80
= $32.00

**Step 3: Calculate the cost if she had bought them as bunches**
Since one bunch costs $3.00, the total cost for 10 bunches would be:
Cost if she had bought them as bunches = Number of bunches * Cost per bunch
= 10 * $3.00
= $30.00

**Step 4: Calculate the savings**
Savings = Cost if she had bought them individually - Cost if she had bought them as bunches
= $32.00 - $30.00
= $2.00

Therefore, Jenny saved **$2.00** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.<|im_end|>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

   \]

So, Sam has 20 feet of the fence.

6. **Calculate Harry's share:**
   \[
   S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
   \]

7. **Verify the total length of the fence:**
   \[
   20 + 80 = 100 \text{ feet}
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the amount left over for Sam after splitting the fence is 20 feet.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** {The final answer is} 20 feet.<|im_end|>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.

Subtracting the 60 from both sides, we get 2x=40
We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the growth rate per year and then use that rate to find out how much the crocodile will grow over 13 years.

Step 1: Calculate the annual growth rate.
- The crocodile grows 8 inches over 4 years.
- To find the annual growth rate, divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4 years).
\[
\text{Annual Growth Rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year}
\]

Step 2: Use the annual growth rate to calculate the growth over 13 years.
- Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches per year, we can multiply this rate by the number of years (13 years).
\[
\text{Growth Over 13 Years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years}
\]
\[
\text{Growth Over 13 Years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, at this rate, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.

**The final answer is:** The crocodile will grow **26 inches** in 13 years.<|im_end|>","Crocodile grows 8/4 = <<8/4=2>>2 inches a year.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of each type of bike Marcel sold in one month and then calculate his earnings based on their respective prices.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of bike sold:**
   - Total bikes sold = 300
   - Half of these were Trekking bikes: \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \)
   - 15% of these were BMX bikes: \( 0.15 \times 150 = 22.5 \). Since we can't sell a fraction of a bike, we'll round up to 23 (assuming they're rounded up for practical purposes).
   - The remaining bikes must be MTB bikes: \( 300 - 150 - 23 = 97 \)

2. **Determine the percentage of each type of bike sold:**
   - Percentage of Trekking bikes sold: \( \frac{150}{300} \times 100\% = 50\% \)
   - Percentage of BMX bikes sold: \( \frac{23}{300} \times 100\% \approx 7.67\% \) (rounded down to 8% since it's not possible to have a fractional percentage)
   - Percentage of MTB bikes sold: \( \frac{97}{300} \times 100\% \approx 32.33\% \) (rounded down to 32%)

3. **Calculate the total revenue from each type of bike sold:**
   - Revenue from Trekking bikes: \( 150 \times \$450 = \$67,500 \)
   - Revenue from BMX bikes: \( 23 \times \$250 = \$5,750 \) (since \( \$250 \) is approximately half of \$500)
   - Revenue from MTB bikes: \( 97 \times \$500 = \$48,500 \)

4. **Sum up the total revenue:**
   - Total revenue: \( \$67,500 + \$5,750 + \$48,500 = \$122,750 \)

Therefore, the total amount Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month is \(\boxed{\$122,750}\).<|im_end|>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

2. **Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck**:
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Subtract the bales picked up from the total bales made**:
   - Total bales made: 30
   - Bales picked up by the truck: 18
   - Remaining bales: \( 30 - 18 = 12 \)

Therefore, at the end of 6 hours, there will be 12 bales of hay left in the field.

                    question:
                    There are 6 periods in the day for ; a normal : student but John has to take 2 extra classes. .  Each class is 40 minutes long.  He goes to . class ! for 5 days a : week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much time John spends learning per week, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total weekly study time**

John takes 2 extra classes each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, he takes \(2 \times 7 = 14\) extra classes.

Each class lasts 40 minutes. Therefore, the total time spent in extra classes in one week is:
\[ 14 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 560 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Convert extra class time into weeks**

Since John studies every weekday (Monday to Friday), he studies for 5 weekdays in a week. The total number of extra minutes he spends studying over the course of a week is:
\[ 560 \text{ minutes} \div 5 \text{ days} = 112 \text{ minutes/day} \]

This means John spends 112 minutes per day on extra learning. To find out how many hours he spends learning each week, we convert the daily extra minutes into hours:
\[ 112 \text{ minutes/day} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1.8333 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate total extra learning time over 5 days**

He also spends an additional fraction of his extra learning time during weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, he spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his total extra weekly minutes on learning.
First, calculate his total extra learning time over 5 weekdays:
\[ 112 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, compute the amount of extra learning time he spends during the weekend:
\[ 560 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1}{16} = 35 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding this weekend learning time to his weekday learning time gives us his total extra learning time:
\[ 560 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 595 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Sum up all learning time**

Finally, add up all the different types of learning time:
- Regular classroom learning: Not specified, but assumed to be negligible or zero for simplicity.
- Extra classroom learning: 560 minutes
- Weekend extra learning: 595 minutes

Total learning time in minutes:
\[ 560 \text{ minutes} + 595 \text{ minutes} = 1155 \text{ minutes} \]

Convert this total learning time from minutes to hours:
\[ 1155 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 19.25 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends **19.25 hours** per week learning.<|im_end|>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day
That means he spends 40*8=<<40*8=320>>320 minutes per day in class

That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial height of the ball when dropped from the third floor balcony:**
   - The third floor is 3 stories above ground level.
   - Each story is 24 feet tall.

   \[
   \text{Total height} = 3 \times 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total height} = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the height after one bounce (first bounce):**
   - The ball reaches half its original height after each bounce due to bouncing back up to 2/3 of its previous height.

   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Initial Height}
   \]

   Substituting the total height of 72 feet:

   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = \frac{2}{3} \times 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Simplify this calculation:

   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = \frac{2 \times 72}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = \frac{144}{3} \text{ feet}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the ball reaches 48 feet after its first bounce.

By following these steps, you can calculate the height of the ball after each bounce until you reach the second bounce. This process ensures accuracy in determining the height of the ball at each stage.<|im_end|>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet

To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of each child based on the information provided. Let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **First Child**:
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   
2. **Second Child**:
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
     \[
     \text{Height of the second child} = \text{Height of the first child} + 2 \text{ inches}

     Substituting the height of the first child (which is 6 feet):
     \[

3. **Third Child**:
   - The third child is five inches shorter than the second child.
     \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many bags were sold:**
   - We know that the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples.
   - Each bag contains 10 apples.

   To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}}
   \]
   
   Substituting the given numbers:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
   \]

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - We know that each bag was sold for $5.
   - We have determined that there were 200 bags sold.

   To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \times 5 = \$1000

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the remaining meat after different creatures have consumed parts of it.

1. **Allosaurus**: The last 270 kg of meat were eaten by the Allosaurus.
   - This means that before the Allosaurus ate its share, there were \(270 \text{ kg}\) of meat left.

2. **Velociraptor**: After the Allosaurus ate its share, the remaining meat was scavenged by a pack of velociraptors.
   - Since the velociraptors only took half of the remaining meat, we can set up an equation to find out how much meat was originally there before the velociraptors scavenged it.
   
Let's denote the original amount of meat as \( M \).

- After the Allosaurus ate its share, the amount of meat left would be \( M - 270 \).
- According to the problem, the velociraptors took half of the remaining meat: 
\[ \frac{M - 270}{2} = \text{(amount taken by velociraptors)} \]

3. **Tyrannosaurus Rex**: Before the T-rex ate, the remaining meat was divided among the velociraptors.
   - From the previous step, we know that \( \frac{M - 270}{2} \) is the amount taken by the velociraptors.
   - Therefore, before the T-rex ate, the total amount of meat was:
\[ 2 \times (\frac{M - 270}{2}) + 270 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ (M - 270) + 270 = M \]

4. **Small Triceratops**: The T-rex ate half of the small triceratops.
   - We also know that the T-rex ate half of the small triceratops.
   - Let \( x \) be the weight of the small triceratops.
   - So, \( \frac{x}{2} \) is the portion of the small triceratops that the T-rex ate.
   - After eating, the remaining meat for the T-rex is:
\[ x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \]
According to the problem, this equals 270 kg:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 270 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 540 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    Tony is painting ? a room with four walls. The north and south walls are 10 ? x 8 feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet. A . gallon of paint can : cover 20 square feet and cost $12. How much will it cost . to paint the , room?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the cost for Tony to paint the room, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall.
- **North-South Walls** (4 walls):
  - Length = 10 ft
  - Width = 8 ft
  - Area = Length × Width = 10 ft × 8 ft = 80 sq ft
  - Since there are two North-South walls, total area for North-South walls = 2 × 80 sq ft = 160 sq ft

- **East-West Walls** (2 walls):
  - Length = 5 ft
  - Width = 8 ft
  - Area = Length × Width = 5 ft × 8 ft = 40 sq ft
  - Since there are two East-West walls, total area for East-West walls = 2 × 40 sq ft = 80 sq ft

### Step 2: Calculate the total area to be painted.
Total area = Area of North-South walls + Area of East-West walls
= 160 sq ft + 80 sq ft = 240 sq ft

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
Since one gallon covers 20 sq ft, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon.
Number of gallons needed = Total area / Coverage per gallon
= 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft/gallon = 12 gallons

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Cost per gallon = $12
Number of gallons = 12
Total cost = Number of gallons × Cost per gallon
= 12 gallons × $12/gallon = $144

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} $144.<|im_end|>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80
The east and west walls are 40 square feet because 5 x 8 = <<5*8=40>>40
The south and north walls total 160 square feet because 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160
The East and west walls total 80 square feet because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
All the walls total 240 square feet because 160 + 80 = <<160+80=240>>240
He will need 12 gallons of paint because 240 / 20 = <<240/20=12>>12

                    question:
                    : Ellen decided to play a prank on her friend. She got a case : of . 12 sodas ; and shook 3 of ! them up. ! Then she , took 1 unshaken soda for herself ! and left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda when they arrive at the party. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of sodas initially.
Ellen has 12 sodas in total.

### Step 2: Calculate how many sodas are shaken after Ellen shakes 3 out of the initial 12.
After shaking 3 sodas out of 12, there are \(12 - 3 = 9\) sodas remaining unshaken.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of sodas taken by Ellen's brother.
Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This means he has \(1 + 2 = 3\) sodas.

### Step 4: Determine the total number of sodas taken by Ellen's friend.
Ellen's friend arrives and takes 1 more unshaken soda (since Ellen already took 2 unshaken sodas). So, Ellen's friend takes 1 unshaken soda plus whatever else remains unshaken or shaken but not yet taken.

Since Ellen's friend only takes one unshaken soda, let's consider the possible scenarios where Ellen's friend might be taking some of the remaining unshaken sodas.

- If all 3 sodas taken by Ellen's brother were unshaken, then none would remain unshaken for Ellen's friend to take any more.
- If exactly two of the three sodas taken by Ellen's brother were unshaken, then the third could have been either shaken or unshaken. However, since we're focusing on the scenario where Ellen's friend takes an unshaken soda, we assume the most likely situation where no further unshaken sodas are available for Ellen's friend.

Given these points, let's conclude:
- After Ellen's brother takes his sodas, there are 6 unshaken sodas left (since 3 unshaken sodas were taken).
- Since Ellen's friend wants to take an unshaken soda, and assuming no other unshaken sodas remain, Ellen's friend will indeed take an unshaken soda.

Thus, the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is high because the friend will definitely take an unshaken soda.

### Conclusion:
The likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is **high**. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 100%.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how far apart the two trains will be after 3 hours. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the speed of each train:**
   - One train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The other train travels at half that speed, so its speed is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the total distance covered by both trains in 3 hours:**
   - Distance covered by the first train in 3 hours: 
     \[
     60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Distance covered by the second train in 3 hours:
     \[
     30 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Add the distances together to find the total distance between the trains:**
   - Total distance between the trains after 3 hours:
     \[
     180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, after 3 hours, the two trains will be 270 miles apart. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 270 miles.<|im_end|>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.
Therefore, to find the distance traveled each hour in total we add both trains' speed together for a total of 60+30=<<90=90>>90 miles traveled each hour.
This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of days Billy works**
- March has 31 days.
- Billy takes off 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th.
- To find out how many days he takes off, calculate 20% of 31:
\[ \text{Days taken off} = 0.20 \times 31 = 6.2 \]
Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we round up to 7 days (because even if he only takes one less day than expected, he still counts as taking off).

- Therefore, the number of days Billy works is \(31 - 7 = 24\) days.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Billy works**
- Billy works for 3 hours a day.
- Number of working days = 24 days
- Total hours worked = \(24 \times 3 = 72\) hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people helped**
- Billy can help 2 people per hour.
- Total people helped = \(72 \times 2 = 144\)

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: **144 people**.<|im_end|>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day
Then multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works to find the total number of people he helps: 6 people/day * 40 days = <<6*40=240>>240 people

   - There are 20 cars.
   - Therefore, the total number of people in the cars = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \).

2. **Calculate the number of people in the buses:**
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - There are 12 buses.
   - Therefore, the total number of people in the buses = \( 12 \times 35 = 420 \).

3. **Add the number of people from the cars and buses to get the total number of people inside the church:**
   - Total people = People in cars + People in buses
   - Total people = \( 60 + 420 = 480 \).

To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time taken for both slides.

1. **Calculate the time taken for the biggest slide:**
   - Length of the biggest slide = 300 feet
   - Speed of the biggest slide = 60 feet per minute
   - Time taken for the biggest slide \( T_1 \) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}}
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     T_1 = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken for the second biggest slide:**
   - Length of the second biggest slide = 240 feet
   - Speed of the second biggest slide = 80 feet per minute
   - Time taken for the second biggest slide \( T_2 \) can be calculated similarly:
     \[
     T_2 = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}}
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     T_2 = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ minutes}

3. **Compare the times:**
   - Time taken for the biggest slide \( T_1 \) is 5 minutes.
   - Time taken for the second biggest slide \( T_2 \) is 3 minutes.
   - The difference in time is:
     \[
     T_1 - T_2 = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Bobby spends on both his lunch and break over a period of 5 days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Lunch Time Calculation:
1. **Daily Lunch Duration:**
   - Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
   
2. **Total Lunch Time Over 5 Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Lunch Time} = 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Lunch Time} = 150 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### Break Time Calculation:
1. **Break Duration Per Day:**
   - Bobby takes a break for 2.15 minutes.
   
2. **Total Break Time Over 5 Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Break Time} = 2.15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Break Time} = 10.75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### Total Time Spent in 5 Days:
1. **Summing Up Lunch and Break Times:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time (minutes)} = \text{Total Lunch Time} + \text{Total Break Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time (minutes)} = 150 \text{ minutes} + 10.75 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time (minutes)} = 160.75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

#### Convert Total Time into Hours:
1. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Total Time (hours)} = \frac{\text{Total Time (minutes)}}{60}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time (hours)} = \frac{160.75}{60}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time (hours)} \approx 2.68 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Final Answer:
After 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to approximately \(2.68\) hours.<|im_end|>","He has 2 15 minutes breaks per day so together they add up to 2*15 = <<2*15=30>>30 minutes

Every day his breaks total 60 minutes and he takes these breaks 5 days per week so he takes 60*5 = <<60*5=300>>300 minutes of break time
60 minutes is in an hour so 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours of break time

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Ahito ran given that the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles and that Micah ran three and a half times as much as Amber.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Micah ran.
Since Micah ran three and a half times what Amber ran, we multiply Amber's distance by 3.5:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times \text{Distance Amber ran} \]

Given that Amber ran 8 miles:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Step 2: Determine the combined distance run by Amber and Micah.
Add the distances run by Amber and Micah:

\[ \text{Combined distance run by Amber and Micah} = 8 + 28 \]
\[ \text{Combined distance run by Amber and Micah} = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Step 3: Subtract the combined distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance to find out how many miles Ahito ran.
Subtract the combined distance run by Amber and Micah from the total distance (52 miles):

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - \text{Combined distance run by Amber and Micah} \]
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final answer is:

                    question:
                    Sheila charged $85.00 worth ? of merchandise on her . credit card.  She ended up ? returning one item that cost $15.00.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial charge on Sheila's credit card.
Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise.

### Step 2: Subtract the value of the returned item.
The return of an item costs $15.00. We subtract this from the initial amount.

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$85.00 - \$15.00 = \$70.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total after the return.
After returning the item, Sheila has $70.00 left on her credit card.

### Step 4: Calculate the price of the frying pan.
The frying pan is sold at a discount of 20%, so it is priced at 80% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price of Frying Pan} = \$20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$20.00 \times 0.80 = \$16.00 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the price of the towel set.
The towel set is also on sale with a discount of 10%, so it is priced at 90% of its original price.

\[ \text{Price of Towel Set} = \$30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$30.00 \times 0.90 = \$27.00 \]

### Step 6: Add the prices of the frying pan and the towel set to the remaining balance.
Now we add the prices of the frying pan and the towel set to the remaining balance.

\[ \text{New Balance} = \$70.00 + \$16.00 + \$27.00 = \$113.00 \]

Therefore, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$113.00}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish are in the tank based on the given information.

1. **Determine the number of large jellyfish:**
   - We know that one-fifth of all jellyfish are large.
   - Let \( x \) represent the total number of jellyfish in the tank.
   - Therefore, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{x}{5} \).

2. **Calculate the number of large jellyfish that change color:**
   - We are told that a third of the large jellyfish change color.
   - So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x}{15} \).

3. **Given that only 6 jellyfish change color:**
   - From the above calculation, we have \( \frac{x}{15} = 6 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = 6 \times 15 = 90 \).

4. **Verify the remaining jellyfish (small ones):**
   - If there are 90 jellyfish in total, then the number of small jellyfish is \( 90 - 6 = 84 \).
   - This matches the description where ""the other jellyfish; are small and always stay blue.""

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine Caroline's age, we need to follow the relationships between their ages step-by-step.

1. **Identify the relationship between Chris and Ben:**
   - Chris is 4 years old.
   - Ben is two times older than Chris.

2. **Calculate Ben's age:**
   \[
   \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8

3. **Determine Caroline's age based on her relationship to Ben:**
   - Caroline is three times older than Ben.
   - We already calculated that Ben is 8 years old.

4. **Calculate Caroline's age:**
   \[
   \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24

                    question:
                    Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does , Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of ? her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to reach her goal of saving for a retirement period of 20 years, we'll break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Lauren's Retirement Savings Goal
Lauren wants to save for a total of 20 years. If she saves 20% of her paycheck each year, we can calculate her savings rate.

Let \( S \) be the amount saved per year from her paycheck.
\[ S = 0.20 \times P \]
where \( P \) is her annual salary.

Since her current annual salary is \$100,000:
\[ S = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \]

Over 20 years, her total savings will be:
\[ Total\ Savings = S \times 20 = 20,000 \times 20 = 400,000 \]

### Step 2: Determine Lauren’s Annual Salary Needed for Her Current Savings Rate
We know that Lauren wants to save 20% of her paycheck each year. Let \( Y \) represent her annual salary needed to achieve this savings rate over time.

If \( R \) is the number of years Lauren has already worked before reaching this point, then:
\[ R \times (Y - 100,000) = 20,000 \]

This equation represents her total savings in those \( R \) years plus an additional 20,000 from her current salary.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation and Solve for \( Y \)
Given that Lauren's current salary is \$100,000 and she aims to save 20% of it annually:
\[ Y = 50,000 \]

Substitute \( Y \) back into the equation:
\[ 50,000 \times (Y - 100,000) = 20,000 \]

Simplify:
\[ 50,000 \times (50,000 - 100,000) = 20,000 \]
\[ 50,000 \times (-50,000) = 20,000 \]

Divide both sides by 50,000:
\[ -50,000 = \frac{20,000}{50,000} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ -1 = \text{fraction} \]

This indicates that Lauren needs to increase her salary significantly or decrease the number of years she works to meet her goal. 

### Conclusion
Lauren needs to either increase her salary or reduce the number of years she works to meet her savings goal within 20 years. Given her current salary of \$100,000, increasing her salary by at least \$50,000 per year would allow her to save \$20,000 each year without needing to work longer than 20 years. Therefore, reducing the number of years she works beyond 20 years is not feasible under these conditions.

**Final Answer:** Lauren needs to increase her salary by at least \$50,000 per year to meet her savings goal within 20 years. She cannot work fewer than 20 years to reach her goal given her current salary.<|im_end|>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the length of each part when the total ribbon is divided into 4 equal parts.

- Total length of ribbon = 100 cm.
- Number of parts to divide = 4.

\[ \text{Length of each part} = \frac{\text{Total length}}{\text{Number of parts}} \]

\[
\text{Length of each part} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
\]

So, each of the four parts will be 25 cm long.

### Step 2: Divide each of these 25 cm pieces further into 5 equal parts.

- Length of each original part (before division) = 25 cm.
- Number of smaller divisions in each part = 5.

\[ \text{Length of each smaller part} = \frac{\text{Length of each original part}}{\text{Number of divisions}} \]

\[
\text{Length of each smaller part} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
\]

So, after dividing each of the 25 cm parts into 5 equal smaller parts, each smaller part will be 5 cm long.

### Final Answer:
Each final cut will be 5 cm long.<|im_end|>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many girls are in the school, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   - We know that 40% of the school's population consists of boys.
   - The number of boys is given as 240.

Let \( T \) represent the total population of the school. According to the information provided:
\[ 0.4T = 240 \]

To find \( T \), divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{240}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

2. **Determine the percentage of girls in the school:**
   - Since the total population is 600, and 40% of this population are boys, the remaining percentage must be girls.
   - Therefore, the percentage of girls is:
     \[ 100\% - 40\% = 60\% \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls in the school:**
   - We need to find out how many girls make up 60% of the total student population.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of girls.
   - Using the fact that 60% of the total population (which is 600) equals the number of girls:
     \[ 0.6 \times 600 = G \]

Now, perform the multiplication:
\[ G = 0.6 \times 600 \]
\[ G = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\).<|im_end|>","100% - 40% = 60% of the school's population are girls.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey on time, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days Soledad has for hiking:**
   - The duration of her vacation is given as ""the entire month of June.""
   - June typically has 30 or 31 days depending on whether it's a leap year.
   
   Let's assume it’s a standard non-leap year (30 days).

2. **Determine the total distance Soledad wants to cover:**
   - She plans to hike 9,300 miles.

3. **Calculate the total number of days in June:**
   - If June has 30 days, then she has exactly 30 days for hiking.

4. **Divide the total distance by the total number of days to find out how far she needs to go each day:**
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Days}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = \frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

6. **Compare this daily distance to what Soledad already plans to do:**
   - According to her plan, she will hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

7. **Calculate the additional distance Soledad still needs to cover each day:**
   \[
   \text{Additional distance per day} = \text{Desired distance per day} - \text{Actual distance per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional distance per day} = 125 \text{ miles/day} - 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

8. **Perform the subtraction:**
   \[
   \text{Additional distance per day} = -185 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Soledad does not need to increase her hiking distance; instead, she needs to reduce her planned distance from two hikes to one hike.

Therefore, Soledad actually needs to decrease her planned hiking distance by \(185\) miles per day to ensure she completes her journey on time.

**Final Answer:** Soledad needs to hike fewer than 125 miles per day to complete her journey on time. Specifically, she should aim to hike no more than approximately 62.5 miles per day to achieve her goal within the available time.<|im_end|>","June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day

                    question:
                    There are currently ; 3 red balls, 11 : blue ? balls, and ! 25 green balls in , the ; store. Red balls cost ! $9, Blue ? balls cost $5 and ; green balls , cost . $3. How much will the store have received ; after all : the . balls are sold?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the balls at their respective prices. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of ball
- Red balls: 3
- Blue balls: 11 (Note: The colon between ""blue"" and ""?"" is likely meant to indicate that there are multiple types or sizes of blue balls, but for simplicity, we'll consider them as one category for now.)
- Green balls: 25

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from red balls
Red balls cost $9 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from red balls} = 3 \times \$9 = \$27 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the revenue from blue balls
Blue balls cost $5 each.
Since we don't know if there are different types of blue balls, we'll assume they're considered one category for simplicity.
\[ \text{Revenue from blue balls} = 11 \times \$5 = \$55 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the revenue from green balls
Green balls cost $3 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from green balls} = 25 \times \$3 = \$75 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all revenues
Now, let's add up the revenues from each type of ball to get the total amount the store will receive.
\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$27 + \$55 + \$75 = \$157 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$157}
\]<|im_end|>","For the red balls, 3 balls * $9/ball = $<<3*9=27>>27.
For the blue balls, 11 balls * $5/ball = $<<11*5=55>>55.

For all balls, $27 + $55 + $75 = $<<27+55+75=157>>157.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the total apples (12 kg) each person gets based on their preferences.

**Step 1: Determine what each person's portion would be if they were free to choose without any restrictions.**

- **Pierre**: He wants one-quarter of the total amount.
\[ \text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

- **Paul**: He wants one-third of what Pierre has chosen.
\[ \text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ kg} \]

- **Jacques**: Since he didn't specify his preference, let’s assume he also takes half of what remains after Pierre and Paul take their shares.
\[ \text{Total remaining after Pierre and Paul} = 12 - 3 - 1 = 8 \text{ kg} \]
\[ \text{Jacques' share} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount for each person after they take their respective portions.**

- **Pierre's remaining**: Already calculated as 3 kg.
- **Paul's remaining**: Already calculated as 1 kg.
- **Jacques' remaining**: Already calculated as 4 kg.

**Step 3: Verify the total amount taken by all three persons equals the initial amount.**

\[ 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 \text{ kg} \]

This matches the total amount of apples initially purchased.

Therefore, James will have 0 kg left since he did not participate in taking any portion of the apples.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is}. James will have 0 kg left.<|im_end|>","Peter wants 12 * 1/4 = <<12*1/4=3>>3 kg of apples.
Paul wants 12 * 1/3 = <<12*1/3=4>>4 kg of apples.
Together, Peter and Paul want a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 kg of apples.
So James will have 12 - 7 = <<12-7=5>>5 kg.

2. **Allowance Savings**: Raymond saves $11 from his allowance.
3. **Comic Book Purchase**: He spends $5 on a comic book.
4. **Puzzle Purchase**: He spends $19 on a puzzle.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Initial Amount
Raymond starts with $21.

### Step 2: Allowance Savings
He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.

\[ \text{New Total} = \$21 + \$11 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the cost of each book, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total Budget**: $16
   - This will be used to calculate the total amount spent on books.

2. **Amount Spent So Far**: $4
   - This is the amount Anna has already spent.

3. **Remaining Budget**: $2
   - This indicates that after buying the books, Anna still has some money left.

4. **Number of Books Bought**: 2

Let's denote the cost of one book as \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Total Amount Needed**:
   Since Anna started with $16 and has $2 left, the total amount needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Needed} = \$16 - \$2 = \$14
   \]

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   Since Anna bought 2 books at the same price, we can set up an equation where the total amount spent equals the total amount needed:
   \[
   2x + \text{Additional Cost (if any)} = \$14
   \]
   
   However, since we don't know if there was additional spending or what it might have been, we assume no extra costs initially unless specified otherwise.

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   We need to find the value of \( x \) such that when multiplied by 2 gives us $14.
   \[
   2x = \$14
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{\$14}{2} = \$7
   \]

Thus, each book costs $7.

### Conclusion:
Each book costs \( \$7 \).<|im_end|>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.
She has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 – $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.
Therefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled last year:**
   - There were 50 students enrolled last year.

2. **Calculate the increase in enrollment percentage:**
   - A 20% increase means that for every 100 students last year, there will be an additional 20 students this year.

3. **Convert the percentage to a decimal:**
   - 20% as a decimal is \( \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \).

4. **Multiply the total number of students last year by the decimal:**
   - The calculation is \( 50 \times 0.2 \).

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \( 50 \times 0.2 = 10 \).

6. **Add the increased number to the original number of students:**
   - The new total number of students this year is \( 50 + 10 \).

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the light blinks in one minute first.

1. **Determine the frequency per minute:**
   - We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.
   - To find out how many times it blinks in one minute, divide the total number of blinks (255) by the total time given (5 minutes).

\[
\text{Frequency per minute} = \frac{\text{Total blinks}}{\text{Total time in minutes}} = \frac{255}{5}
\]

2. **Calculate the result from step 1:**
   
\[
\frac{255}{5} = 51
\]

So, the light blinks 51 times every minute.

3. **Determine the time for 459 blinks:**

- Now that we know the light blinks 51 times per minute, we can calculate how long it takes to blink 459 times.
  
\[
\text{Time for 459 blinks} = \frac{\text{Number of blinks}}{\text{Blinks per minute}}
\]

\[
\text{Time for 459 blinks} = \frac{459}{51}
\]

4. **Calculate the result from step 3:**

\[
\frac{459}{51} = 9 \text{ minutes}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of fish in Tate's garden pond.

- **Male Guppies**: There are initially 4 male guppies.
- **Female Guppies**: There are initially 7 female guppies.
- **Male Goldfishes**: There are initially 3 male goldfishes.
- **Female Goldfishes**: There are initially 5 female goldfishes.

Total initial number of fish = (male guppies + female guppies) + (male goldfishes + female goldfishes)
= (4 + 7) + (3 + 5)
= 11 + 8
= 19

So, at the beginning, Tate has a total of 19 fish.

### Step 2: Calculate the new numbers after buying additional fish.

- **Buying 2 Male Guppies**:
    - New count of male guppies = 4 (initial) + 2 (newly bought) = 6
- **Buying 1 Female Guppy**:
    - New count of female guppies = 7 (initial) + 1 (newly bought) = 8
- **Buying 2 Male Goldfishes**:
    - New count of male goldfishes = 3 (initial) + 2 (newly bought) = 5
- **Buying 3 Female Goldfishes**:
    - New count of female goldfishes = 5 (initial) + 3 (newly bought) = 8

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of fish now.

New total number of fish = (male guppies + female guppies) + (male goldfishes + female goldfishes)
= (6 + 8) + (5 + 8)
= 14 + 13
= 27

Now Tate has a total of 27 fish.

### Step 4: Determine how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has.

- **Number of female fishes**: 8
- **Number of male fishes**: 6

Difference = Number of female fishes - Number of male fishes
= 8 - 6
= 2

Therefore, Tate has 2 more female fishes than male fishes.

### Final Answer: The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).<|im_end|>","Tate has a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for each person to complete their assigned chore and then sum up these times.

1. **Determine the time Megan spent walking the dog:**
   - Megan walked the dog in 2 hours.
   - This is 2 hours more than Amalia’s 4-hour time to mow the lawn.

2. **Calculate the time Dior spent doing laundry:**
   - Dior did laundry, taking a time that is “well over” 4 hours longer than what Amalia took to mow the lawn.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, any value greater than or equal to 4 hours would qualify as ""well over.""
   
3. **Summarize the times taken by each person:**
   - Amalia: 4 hours
   - Megan: 2 hours (mowing the lawn)
   - Dior: Let's denote the time Dior spent on laundry as \( t \). We know \( t \geq 4 \) hours because it is ""well over"" 4 hours.

4. **Add up the total time taken by all three:**
   - Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
   - Total time = 4 hours (Amalia) + 2 hours (Megan) + \( t \) hours (Dior)

5. **Final calculation:**
   - If we assume Dior's time is exactly 4 hours (the minimum ""well over"" condition), then the total time is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}

   - The speed of travel is given as 70 mph.
   - The time taken for one-way driving is 2 hours.

2. **Determine the total distance driven for a round trip:**
   - Since the speed remains constant (70 mph), the distance can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \).
   - For a one-way trip, the distance is \( 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Calculate the total distance for a round trip:**
   - A round trip involves going to his parents' house and then returning home.
   - Therefore, the total distance for a round trip is \( 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \).

### Step 1: Determine Sofie's total walking distance over 7 days.
Sofie walks 10 miles every day for 7 days.

\[
\text{Total distance Sofie walks} = 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Sofie will walk on her first day.
Since Sofie walks twice as much as Brian on any given day, we need to find out how much Brian walks on his first day.

Let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian walks on his first day. According to the problem, Sofie walks twice as far as Brian does on that day.

So,

\[
B + B = 10 \Rightarrow 2B = 10 \Rightarrow B = 5 \text{ miles}
\]

This means Brian walks 5 miles on his first day.

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance Brian walks over 7 days.
Brian walks 5 miles on each of the 7 days.

\[
\text{Total distance Brian walks} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ miles}
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Brian will walk **35 miles** in seven days.

The final answer is: The final answer is 35.<|im_end|>","If Sofie walks 10 miles each day, she will walk 7*10 = <<10*7=70>>70 miles in seven days.

                    question:
                    A toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the : workers produce 6 toys an hour, and . another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour. They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order. How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate total production needed
First, let's calculate the total number of toys that were ordered.

\[ \text{Total toys ordered} = 400 \]

### Step 2: Determine current production capacity
We know that there are five workers working over a 10-hour shift. Two of these workers produce 6 toys per hour, and two others produce 4 toys per hour. The fifth worker is also producing at some rate but not specified yet.

Let \( x \) represent the number of toys produced per hour by the fifth worker.

### Step 3: Set up equations based on given information
- **Two workers** (each producing 6 toys/hour):
  \[ 2 \times 6 \times 10 = 120 \]
  
- **Another two workers** (each producing 4 toys/hour):
  \[ 2 \times 4 \times 10 = 80 \]

Since they have already worked for 10 hours, their total production so far is:
\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \]

### Step 4: Calculate remaining toys needed
According to the problem, after working for 10 hours, the factory still needs to make 20 more toys to complete the order.

Therefore, the total number of toys required to fulfill the order is:
\[ 400 \]

Thus, the remaining amount to be made is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \]

### Step 5: Set up equation for the fifth worker's contribution
Now, let’s consider the contributions from all six workers together:
\[ 120 + 80 + 10x = 380 \] (since the fifth worker works for the full 10 hours)

Simplify the left side:
\[ 200 + 10x = 380 \]

Subtract 200 from both sides:
\[ 10x = 180 \]

Divide by 10:
\[ x = 18 \]

### Final Answer:
The fifth worker produces **18 toys per hour**.<|im_end|>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the weights of the dogs:**
   - We know Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.
   - Elijah's first dog weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of Kory's dog.
     \[
     \text{Elijah's first dog weight} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Elijah's second dog weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of Kory's dog.
     \[
     \text{Elijah's second dog weight} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of Elijah's two dogs:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Add the weight of Kory's dog to Elijah's total:**
   \[
   \text{Combined total weight} = 45 + 60 = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the combined weight of Elijah's two dogs and Kory's dog is 105 pounds.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 105 pounds.<|im_end|>","Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many stickers Luis received:**
   - Let \( S \) be the total number of stickers Seth originally had.
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis: \( \frac{S}{2} \).

2. **Calculate how many stickers Luis has after using some:**
   - Luis used half of what he got from Seth: \( \frac{\frac{S}{2}}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \).
   - Therefore, Luis now has \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{3S}{4} \) stickers.

3. **Find out how many stickers were left for Kris:**
   - After giving stickers to Luis, there are \( \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{3S}{4} \) stickers left.
   - Kris keeps 9 stickers, so the remaining stickers go to Rob.
   - The number of stickers left before Kris gets any is \( \frac{3S}{4} - 9 \).

4. **Determine how many stickers Rob receives:**
   - After Kris takes her share, Rob gets the remaining 7 stickers.
   - So, \( \frac{3S}{4} - 9 + 7 = \frac{S}{4} \).

5. **Set up an equation based on the information given about Rob’s share:**
   - Since Rob got the remaining 7 stickers after Kris took hers, we know that \( \frac{S}{4} = 7 \).

6. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - From \( \frac{S}{4} = 7 \), multiply both sides by 4 to find \( S \):
     \[
     S = 7 \times 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **John packs:**
   - John packs M&M candies into small bags.

2. **He buys:**
   - John buys 3 large bags.
   - Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.

3. **If one ounce of M&M candy contains:**
   - 30 M&M candies.

4. **How many small bags can be made?**
   - John puts 10 M&M candies in each small bag.

Now, let's calculate the total number of M&M candies John has from the large bags:

- Each large bag weighs 10 ounces.
- There are 3 large bags.

So, the total weight of all large bags combined is:
\[ 10 \text{ ounces/bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many small bags John can fill with these 30 ounces of M&M candies. 

Since each small bag holds 10 M&M candies, we divide the total number of M&M candies (from the large bags) by the capacity of each small bag:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ ounces}}{10 \text{ M&M/candy per bag}} = 3 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the final answer is that John can make **3** small bags containing 10 M&M candies each.<|im_end|>","He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 ounces of M&M

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Alfie needs to travel:**
   - The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.
   - Alfie wants to fly halfway around the Earth.
   - Therefore, the distance he needs to cover is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Circumference}}{2} = \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of days needed for Alfie to complete his journey:**
   - Alfie flies at a speed of 400 kilometers per day.
   - To find out how many days it takes him to cover 20,000 kilometers, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days}

To determine how fast the faster car goes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the fastest car, second fastest car, and average car speeds**.
2. **Determine the speed of the second fastest car based on its relation to the average car**.
3. **Use the given information about the relationship between the fastest car and the second fastest car to find the speed of the fastest car**.
4. **Find the speed of the faster car using the relationship provided in the problem**.

Let's start with the relationships:

- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car.
- The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.

From this, we know:
\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times (\text{Speed of second fastest car}) \]
\[ \text{Speed of second fastest car} = 5 \times (\text{Speed of average car}) \]

Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph), we can calculate the speed of the second fastest car as follows:
\[ \text{Speed of second fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph} \]

Now, knowing the speed of the second fastest car, we can find the speed of the fastest car:
\[ \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph} = 750 \text{ mph} \]

Finally, we use the relationship between the fastest car and the second fastest car to find the speed of the faster car:
\[ \text{Speed of faster car} = 1.25 \times (\text{Speed of fastest car}) \]
\[ \text{Speed of faster car} = 1.25 \times 750 \text{ mph} = 937.5 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the faster car can go at a speed of \( 937.5 \) miles per hour.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( L \) be Liam's current age.
Let \( V \) be Vince's current age.

From the problem statement, we know that:
- Liam is currently 16 years old (\( L = 16 \)).
- Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age.

### Step 2: Express the Ages in Terms of Time Ago
Two years ago, Liam would have been \( L - 2 \) years old.
Two years ago, Vince would have been \( V - 2 \) years old.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age:
\[ L - 2 = 2(V - 2) \]

### Step 3: Substitute Liam's Age into the Equation
We already know that \( L = 16 \), so substitute \( L \) into the equation:
\[ 16 - 2 = 2(V - 2) \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

### Step 5: Solve for Vince's Current Age
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ 7 = V - 2 \]

Add 2 to both sides to isolate \( V \):
\[ V = 9 \]

So, Vince is currently 9 years old.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.

So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we will break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define variables to represent the unknown quantities:

- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs that Arnold painted.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs that Madeline painted (since they painted the same number).
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs that Camden painted.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs that Sarah painted.

We know from the problem statement that:
\[ A + M = M + N \]
where \( N \) represents the number of eggs that Arnold and Madeline painted together.

Also, according to the problem:
\[ C + S = 30 \]
and
\[ C = S + 12 \]

### Step 2: Substitute Known Values
Substitute \( M \) for \( N \) in the first equation:
\[ A + M = M \implies A = 0 \]

Since \( A = 0 \), we can simplify our equations further without considering \( A \).

Now, substitute \( C = S + 12 \) in the second equation:
\[ C + S = 30 \implies (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Using \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Eggs Painted
From the information given:
\[ A + M = M \]
\[ A + M = N \]
Given \( A = 0 \), we have:
\[ 0 + M = M \]
This implies \( M \) must equal \( N \). Therefore, let’s denote the total eggs as:
\[ T = A + B + C + D \]
where \( B = M \).

Thus,
\[ T = 0 + M + 21 + 9 \]
\[ T = M + 30 \]

Given \( T = 56 \):
\[ 56 = M + 30 \]
\[ M = 26 \]

So, \( M = 26 \) and \( N = 26 \).

### Step 4: Determine Final Answers
- Since \( A = 0 \) and \( M = 26 \), Arnold painted 0 eggs.
- Camden painted \( C = 21 \) eggs.
- The difference between Camden's and Arnold's egg count is:
\[ C - A = 21 - 0 = 21 \]

Therefore, **Camden painted 21 more eggs than Arnold**. 

{The final answer is} 21.<|im_end|>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.

4. Add the weights together to find the total weight.

### Step 1: Determine how many boxes Nik will use

Nik has 200 crayons and each box can hold 8 crayons.
\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total number of crayons}}{\text{Crayons per box}} = \frac{200}{8} = 25
\]

So, Nik will use 25 boxes.

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces.
\[
\text{Weight of one box} = 8 \text{ ounces}
\]
Since there are 25 boxes,
\[
\text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \times 8 \text{ ounces} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the crayons

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
\[
\text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crystal} = 200 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 4: Add the weights together to find the total weight

First, add the total weight of the boxes and the total weight of the crayons:
\[
\text{Total weight (in ounces)} = 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} + 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
\]

Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound.
\[
\text{Total weight (in pounds)} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is \(25\) pounds.

Ending Answer:
The final answer is \(25\) pounds.<|im_end|>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.
25 boxes * 8 ounces per box = <<25*8=200>>200 ounces.
Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 + 200 = <<200+200=400>>400 ounces.
400 ounces / 16 ounces per pound = <<400/16=25>>25 pounds.

                    question:
                    John cuts : down ? an 80-foot tree.  He : can make , logs out of : 80% of it. He cuts it , into ! 4-foot logs.  From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks. ,  He . then sells each plank : for $1.2.  ; How much does he make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many 4-foot logs John can get from the tree.
- The total length of the tree is 80 feet.
- John makes logs from 80% of the tree.

\[ \text{Number of logs} = 80 \times 0.8 = 64 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many planks John gets from each log.
- Each log is cut into 5 planks.

\[ \text{Planks per log} = 5 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of planks John has in total.
- John has 64 logs.

\[ \text{Total planks} = 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue John makes from selling the planks.
- Each plank is sold for $1.2.

\[ \text{Revenue from all planks} = 320 \times 1.2 = 384 \]

Therefore, the amount John makes is **$384**.<|im_end|>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Valerie's Brother's Salary
Valerie earns $5000 per month. According to the problem, Valerie earns half of what her brother earns.

Let \( B \) represent her brother's monthly earnings.
\[ \frac{1}{2}B = \$5000 \]

To find \( B \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ B = 2 \times \$5000 \]
\[ B = \$10,000 \]

So, her brother earns $10,000 per month.

### Step 2: Calculate Their Combined Monthly Salary
Their combined monthly salary is the sum of Valerie's and her brother's salaries:
\[ Combined\ Salary = \$5000 + \$10,000 \]
\[ Combined\ Salary = \$15,000 \]

### Step 3: Determine Their Mother's Salary
The problem states that their mother earns twice their combined salary.
\[ Mother's\ Salary = 2 \times \$15,000 \]
\[ Mother's\ Salary = \$30,000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Money They Have Together
Now, add up all their salaries:
\[ Total\ Money = Valerie's\ Salary + Her\ Brother's\ Salary + Mother's\ Salary \]
\[ Total\ Money = \$5000 + \$10,000 + \$30,000 \]
\[ Total\ Money = \$45,000 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money they all have together is:
\[
\boxed{\$45,000}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use it to calculate the time taken for Grandma's entire walk.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance Grandma walks.
Grandma walks 3 miles in total, as stated in the problem.

### Step 2: Determine the distances on the beach and the sidewalk.
- The beach part is 2 miles.
- The sidewalk part is 1 mile.

### Step 3: Verify the total distance.
We can check if the sum of these parts equals 3 miles.
\[ 2 \text{ miles (beach)} + 1 \text{ mile (sidewalk)} = 3 \text{ miles} \]

This confirms our understanding of the distances.

### Step 4: Determine the ratio of speeds on different parts of the walk.
It is stated that Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

### Step 5: Calculate the time spent on the beach.
Given that 40 minutes is spent on the beach, we need to determine the time spent on the sidewalk.

Let \( t_b \) be the time spent on the beach and \( t_s \) be the time spent on the sidewalk.

From the problem, we know:
\[ t_b = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the speed on the sidewalk is twice that on the beach, the time spent on the sidewalk will be half of the time spent on the beach because they cover the same distance.

Therefore,
\[ t_s = \frac{t_b}{2} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total time for the entire walk.
Total time is the sum of the times spent on the beach and the sidewalk.

\[ T_{\text{total}} = t_b + t_s \]
\[ T_{\text{total}} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ T_{\text{total}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:

\[ \boxed{60 \text{ minutes}} \]<|im_end|>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and perform calculations step by step.

1. **Identify the current savings**: Jane currently has saved $4 in allowances over the past 8 weeks.
2. **Calculate the total amount saved so far**:
   \[
   \text{Total saved} = \$4 \times 8 = \$32
   \]
3. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $60**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \$60 - \$32 = \$28

5. **Determine how many more weeks are needed to save the remaining $28 at the rate of $0.50 per week**:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{\$28}{\$0.50} = 56

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the current number of marbles Bob has.
Let \( x \) represent the total number of marbles Bob currently has.

### Step 2: Calculate the additional marbles Bob receives.
Bob receives an amount represented as \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) marbles (since one dozen equals 12).

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the information provided.
After receiving the additional marbles, Bob will have a total of \( x + 24 \) marbles.

According to the problem, after receiving these marbles, Bob will have a total of 60 marbles. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, initially, Bob had 36 marbles.

### Step 5: Determine the number of marbles Bob loses.
Bob loses 10 marbles.

### Step 6: Calculate the remaining number of marbles.
Subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, Bob will have **26** marbles left after losing 10 of them.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the condition for drinking water:**
   - Donny can only drink water if its temperature is at least 40 degrees.

2. **Determine the temperatures in the mugs:**
   - Mug A (33 degrees): This does not meet the drinking condition.
   - Mug B (unknown temperature): This needs to be checked against the drinking condition.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water poured into the drinkable mug:**
   - Pouring 4 ounces from Mug A into the drinkable mug.
   - Pouring 1 ounce from Mug B into the drinkable mug.

4. **Sum up the amounts of water used:**
   - Total water used = 4 ounces + 1 ounce = 5 ounces.

5. **Ensure that the drinkable mug contains enough water to meet the drinking condition:**
   - Since the drinkable mug already holds 4 ounces from Mug A and we pour another 1 ounce from Mug B, the total amount in the drinkable mug will be more than 4 ounces.

6. **Calculate the minimum temperature required for the drinkable mug:**
   - Let \( T \) represent the minimum temperature needed for the drinkable mug to meet the drinking condition.
   - We know that 4 ounces from Mug A alone must reach or exceed 40 degrees because Donny cannot drink water below 40 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( 4 \times 10^\circ C \leq 40^\circ C \).

7. **Find the minimum temperature for Mug B:**
   - Since the drinkable mug already meets the condition with 4 ounces from Mug A, adding any additional water from Mug B should also ensure the drinkable mug reaches or exceeds 40 degrees.
   - Let \( x \) represent the temperature of Mug B.
   - Then, \( 10x \geq 40 \).

8. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   10x \geq 40 \\
   x \geq 4

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals Melanie's father has at the end of three weeks after considering the contributions from two different companies.

### Step 1: Initial Counting
At the beginning, Melanie's father starts with:
- **Cows**: 50
- **Chickens**: 20

So, the initial count of animals on the farm is \( 50 \) cows + \( 20 \) chickens = \( 70 \) animals.

### Step 2: Calculate Contributions Over Three Weeks
Each company contributes a certain number of animals daily:

- **Milkie Cows Limited** contributes \( 20 \) cows per day.
- **Broilers Limited** contributes \( 10 \) chickens per day.

Since they do so for three weeks (which is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days), we can calculate their contributions over this period.

#### Contribution from Milkie Cows Limited:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

#### Contribution from Broilers Limited:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

### Step 3: Update Animal Counts After Three Weeks
We now update the counts based on these contributions:

- **Total Cows**:
\[ 50 \text{ (initial)} + 420 \text{ (from Milkie Cows Limited)} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

- **Total Chickens**:
\[ 20 \text{ (initial)} + 210 \text{ (from Broilers Limited)} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

### Step 4: Total Number of Animals
Finally, summing the updated counts gives us the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks:

\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is {The final answer is}: 700.<|im_end|>","Animals were brought to the farm for three weeks, which is 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.

To determine the cost per single bagel after the discount, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
- Each pack contains 9 bagels.
- Russell orders 4 packs.

\[

\]

### Step 2: Determine the original price for 36 bagels without any discount.
- The price of one pack is $10.00.
- Since there are 9 bagels in one pack, we can find out the price per bagel.

\[
\text{Price per bagel} = \frac{\$10.00}{9}
\]

\[
\text{Price per bagel} = \$1.1111...\approx \$1.11

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and follow a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.
Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

\[
\text{Number of scoops} = 23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

### Step 2: Determine the number of potatoes needed for one scoop of mashed potatoes.
We know that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

\[
\text{Potatoes per scoop} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

So, it takes 2 potatoes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops.
Since it takes 2 potatoes to make one scoop, we multiply the number of scoops by the number of potatoes per scoop:

\[
\text{Total potatoes} = 18 \times 2 = 36
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate a total of **36** potatoes.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 36}}
\]<|im_end|>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.
3 less than 6 potatoes is 6-3=<<6-3=3>>3 potatoes.
1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes is 3-1=<<3-1=2>>2 scoops of mashed potatoes.
Thus, if Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, and it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, then Gomer ate 18*(3/2)=<<18*(3/2)=27>>27 potatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many dozen eggs Chester needs over 60 days, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will eat \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) eggs.

2. **Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:**
   - After increasing his consumption to 5 eggs per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will eat \( 5 \times 30 = 150 \) eggs.

3. **Add the total number of eggs from both periods:**
   - From the first 30 days: 90 eggs.
   - From the next 30 days: 150 eggs.
   - Total eggs needed: \( 90 + 150 = 240 \) eggs.

4. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   - To find out how many dozens of eggs are needed, divide the total number of eggs by 12: 
     \[
     \frac{240}{12} = 20 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Therefore, Chester will need \(\boxed{20}\) dozen eggs for 60 days.<|im_end|>","He starts off eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days for a total of 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 eggs

<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( G \) represent the number of green jellybeans.
Let \( R \) represent the number of red jellybeans.
Let \( B \) represent the number of blue jellybeans.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know:
- There are 17 green jellybeans (\( G = 17 \)).
- The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans (\( R = 2G \)).
- The total number of jellybeans is 60 (\( G + R + B = 60 \)).

Substitute \( G = 17 \) into the equation for \( R \):
\[ R = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now substitute \( G \) and \( R \) into the total jellybean equation:
\[ 17 + 34 + B = 60 \]

### Step 3: Solve for Blue Jellybeans
Combine the known quantities:
\[ 51 + B = 60 \]
Subtract 51 from both sides:
\[ B = 60 - 51 \]
\[ B = 9 \]

So, there are **9** blue jellybeans in the jar.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 17 green jelly beans * 2 = <<17*2=34>>34 red jelly beans.

As the rest are blue, there must be 60 total jellybeans – 51 red and green jelly beans = <<60-51=9>>9 blue jelly beans.

- Tim grows 5 trees each year for a period of one decade (10 years).

### Step 2: Calculate total number of trees grown during the decade.
- Since Tim grows 5 trees per year for 10 years,
\[ \text{Total number of trees} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many lemons are collected from each tree per year.
- The problem states that Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree every year.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of lemons collected from all trees over the decade.
- Since there are 50 trees and Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree per year,
\[ \text{Total lemons per year} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \]
- Over 10 years, the total number of lemons collected would be:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of men and women initially on the bus**:
   - We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9.
   - Let's denote the number of men as \( M \) and the number of women as \( W \).
   - According to the given ratio, \( M : W = 5 : 9 \).

2. **Set up an equation based on the total number of passengers**:
   - The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
   - This means \( M + W = 84 \).

3. **Express \( M \) in terms of \( W \)**:
   - Since \( M : W = 5 : 9 \), we can write \( M = 5k \) and \( W = 9k \) for some constant \( k \).

4. **Substitute into the total passengers equation**:
   - Substitute \( M = 5k \) and \( W = 9k \) into \( M + W = 84 \):
     \[
     5k + 9k = 84
     \]
     \[
     14k = 84
     \]

5. **Solve for \( k \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 14:
     \[
     k = \frac{84}{14} = 6
     \]

6. **Calculate the initial number of men and women**:
   - Now that we know \( k = 6 \):
     \[
     M = 5k = 5 \times 6 = 30
     \]
     \[
     W = 9k = 9 \times 6 = 54
     \]

7. **Determine the number of women who alighted at the next stop**:
   - Given that 20 women alighted, the remaining number of women is:
     \[
     54 - 20 = 34
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{34}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of flowers sold:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers.
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of bouquets sold.

   We can set up an equation based on the earnings:
   \[
   26 = 12x \times 8
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   26 = 96x \\
   x = \frac{26}{96} = \frac{13}{48}
   \]
   Since \( x \) must be a whole number (you can't sell a fraction of a bouquet), we need to round down because you can only sell complete bouquets.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold in one day:**
   - From the information given, Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets per day.
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of sunflowers sold per day.

   Setting up the equation:
   \[
   56 = 12y
   \]

   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{56}{12} = \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67
   \]
   Again, since \( y \) must be a whole number, we'll round down because you can only sell complete sets of sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold over 3 days:**
   - To find out how many sunflowers Faraday could sell after 3 days, multiply the daily amount by 3:
   \[
   \text{Total sunflowers sold} = 4.67 \times 3 = 14
   \]

Therefore, Faraday was able to sell **14** sunflowers after 3 days.<|im_end|>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.

   - Adam has $100 initially.
   - Each rock costs $5.
   
   \[

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of his inventory:**
   - Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells \( 0.60 \times 20 \) rocks.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many days Lauren needs to complete all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the total number of scenes she has to produce and then divide that by the number of scenes she can produce in one day.

1. Calculate the total number of scenes:
   - Large-sized picture scenes: 45
   - Medium-sized picture scenes: 36
   - Small-sized picture scenes: 49
   
   Total = 45 + 36 + 49 = 120

2. Determine how many scenes Lauren can produce in one day:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.

3. Find out which type of scene produces the fastest:
   - Large-sized picture scenes (5 scenes/day)
   - Medium-sized picture scenes (6 scenes/day)
   - Small-sized picture scenes (7 scenes/day)

Since Lauren's drawing speed increases as the size of the picture scenes increase, she should focus on producing the largest possible scenes first to minimize the time needed.

Therefore, Lauren should use her best option, which is drawing 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.

4. Calculate the number of days required:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{120}{7}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} \approx 17.14
   \]

Since Lauren cannot work for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole number:

\[
\text{Number of days} = 18

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Jen spends on food in May, let's break down the information given:

1. **Jen got 3 fish**.
2. **Each person needs $1 worth of food per day**.

Firstly, we calculate the total number of days in May:
- May has 31 days.

Next, we find out how many meals (fish) Jen gets per day:
- Since there are 3 fish and each person needs $1 worth of food per meal, Jen will have 3 meals per day.

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Jen spends on food for one day:
- Each meal costs $1.
- With 3 meals per day, Jen spends \(3 \times \$1 = \$3\) per day.

Finally, to find out how much Jen spends on food for an entire month (May), we multiply her daily cost by the number of days in May:
- Total spent on food in May: \(3 \text{ days} \times \$3 \text{ per day} = \$9\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{\$9}\).<|im_end|>","He spends 3*1=$<<3*1=3>>3 on food a day

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of roses:**
   - Patricia starts with 30 roses.

2. **Roses given away:**
   - Patricia gives away 24 roses to her mother.
     Calculation: \(30 - 24 = 6\)
   - After giving away roses, Patricia has \(30 - 24 = 6\) roses left.

3. **Additional roses bought:**
   - Patricia then buys 15 more roses.
     Calculation: \(6 + 15 = 21\)
   - After buying roses, Patricia has \(6 + 15 = 21\) roses in total.

Therefore, the final number of roses Patricia has now is \(\boxed{21}\).<|im_end|>","Patricia had 30 - 24 = <<30-24=6>>6 roses left after she gave 24 roses to her mother.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To find the average speed that Sid was traveling, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the initial average speed**
- Distance traveled initially: 110 miles
- Time taken: 2 hours
- Average Speed = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}\)

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{110 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 55 \text{ mph} \]

**Step 2: Determine the time for the additional journey**
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total time including the second trip: \(2 + 3\) hours (since it's 3 hours after the first 2-hour trip)
- Total time = 5 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance for both trips**
- Initial distance: 110 miles
- Additional distance: 140 miles
- Total distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

**Step 4: Calculate the average speed for the combined trip**
- Total distance = 250 miles
- Total time = 5 hours
- Average Speed = \(\frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\)

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the average speed that Sid was traveling throughout his journey is **50 mph**.<|im_end|>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that both lottery tickets will win. We'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the individual probabilities**

- **First Lottery Ticket**
  - The first lottery ticket has a 20% (or 0.2) chance of winning.
  
- **Second Lottery Ticket**
  - The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win compared to the first one. Since the first one has a 20% chance, the second one would have a 3 * 20% = 60% (or 0.6) chance of winning.

**Step 2: Determine the combined probabilities for each event**

- For the first lottery ticket to win:
  - Probability of winning = 0.2
  
- For the second lottery ticket to win:
  - Probability of winning = 0.6

**Step 3: Multiply these probabilities together**

Since the events are independent, we multiply their respective probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Both Win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 Wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 Wins}) \]

Substituting in our values:

\[ P(\text{Both Win}) = 0.2 \times 0.6 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the result**

\[ P(\text{Both Win}) = 0.12 \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 0.12 or 12%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - This number (27) is 5 more than what Carlos collected.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
   - We can set up the equation: 
     \[
     C + 5 = 27
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]
   - Therefore, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

2. **Calculate how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     2R = 22
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]
   - Therefore, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells collected by all three:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells is:
     \[
     27 + 22 + 11 = 60
     \]

4. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among the three people:**
   - To find out how many each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3.
   - The number each person gets is:
     \[
     \frac{60}{3} = 20

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week based on his eating habits.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten during the weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays.
   - Each weekday, Mason eats 4 carrots.
   
   \[
   \text{Carrots per weekday} = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekdays} = 5
   \]

   Therefore,

   \[
   \text{Total carrots (weekdays)} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on Saturdays:**
   - On Saturdays, Mason eats 5 carrots.

3. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on Sundays:**
   - On Sundays, Mason also eats 5 carrots.

4. **Sum up all the carrots eaten throughout the week:**

   \[
   \text{Total carrots (weekend days)} = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

5. **Add the total from the weekdays and the weekend days together:**

   \[
   \text{Total carrots (week)} = 20 + 10 = 30

   - John bought a cassette.
   - The cassette contains 2 songs.
   - The first song is 5 minutes long.
   - The second song is 60% longer than the first song.

2. **Calculate the length of the second song:**
   - First, find out how much longer the second song is compared to the first song.
     \[
     \text{Length increase} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this increase to the length of the first song to get the length of the second song.
     \[
     \text{Second song length} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the cassette:**
   - Sum the lengths of both songs to find the total length of the cassette.
     \[
     \text{Total length} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Check if the second song is indeed 60% longer than the first song.
     \[
     \frac{\text{Second song length}}{\text{First song length}} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 = 60\%

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and proceed step by step.

1. **Understanding the transaction details**:
   - Linus buys one mobile device for $20.
   - He then sells it for twice its original price ($20 * 2 = $40).

2. **Calculating his profit per device**:
   - Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price
   - Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

   - Last Tuesday: 4 devices

4. **Total number of devices purchased**:
   - Last Monday: 1 device
   - Last Tuesday: 4 devices
   - Total devices = 1 + 4 = 5 devices

5. **Calculate total profit**:
   - Profit from 1 device = $20
   - Profit from 4 devices on Tuesday = 4 * $20 = $80
   - Total profit = Profit from 1 device + Profit from 4 devices on Tuesday
   - Total profit = $20 + $80 = $100

6. **Final Answer**:
   The final answer is that Linus earned a profit of $100.<|im_end|>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40

2. **Determine the length of Carl's cane:**
   - The cane is half as long as Carl's height.
     \[
     \text{Length of cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ ft}}{2} = 3 \text{ ft}

Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- **Hortex? Company** produces bottled carrot juices.
- **Every day**, they can produce 4200 bottles of these juices.
- **Each juice can cover 20% of one person’s daily energy demand**.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of people that need to be satisfied with the juices.
We are asked how many more bottles Hortex? would have to produce to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy coverage required for 2300 people.
Given that each juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total energy coverage needed as follows:
\[ \text{Total Energy Coverage} = 2300 \times (0.2) \]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation.
\[ \text{Total Energy Coverage} = 2300 \times 0.2 = 460 \]

So far, we know that 460 bottles of juice are needed to cover the energy demands of 2300 people.

### Step 5: Determine how many more bottles are required to reach 4200 bottles per day.
Since they already produce 4200 bottles per day, the additional number of bottles needed can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Additional Bottles Needed} = 4200 - 460 \]

### Step 6: Perform the subtraction.
\[ \text{Additional Bottles Needed} = 4200 - 460 = 3740 \]

Therefore, Hortex? would need to produce an additional 3740 bottles of juices to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 3740}}
\]<|im_end|>","Each juice covers only 20% of the daily energy demand, so to cover 100%, one person would need 100 / 20 = <<100/20=5>>5 juices.

We know that \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-dressed babies wear bows.

Let's denote the total number of purple-dressed babies as \( P \). Since there are 6 purple-dressed babies, \( P = 6 \).

From the information provided, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of these 6 babies wear bows.
So, the number of purple-bow-wearing babies = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \).

### Step 4: Determine the total number of babies who wear bows
Since all blue-dressed babies wear bows, the total number of babies who wear bows is \( 2 + 2 = 4 \).

### Step 5: Calculate the probability
The probability that a baby wearing a bow is purple can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-bow-wearing babies}}{\text{Total number of babies who wear bows}} \]
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \).<|im_end|>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies
Then multiply that number by 1/3 to find the number of babies wearing purple and bows: 6 babies * 1/3 = <<6*1/3=2>>2 babies
Then subtract the number of purple-wearing babies from the total number of babies to find the number of blue-wearing babies: 8 babies - 6 babies = <<8-6=2>>2 babies
Now divide the number of purple bow babies by the total number of bow babies to find the percentage chance a bow baby wears purple: 2 babies / (2 babies + 2 babies) = 2 babies / 4 babies = .5 * 100% = 50%

                    question:
                    , Last ! week the IRS received 5168 tax . reports. On Monday ; and Tuesday ! they , received ? a total of ? 1907 , reports. : On Thursday and Friday . they ! received a total : of . 2136 , reports. How ; many reports . did , they , receive on ? Wednesday?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tax returns were received by the IRS over the entire period from Monday to Friday.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of reports for Monday and Tuesday:**
   - The total number of reports received in one day (Monday or Tuesday) is given as 1907.
   - There are two days (Monday and Tuesday), so the total number of reports over these two days is:
     \[
     1907 + 1907 = 3814
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of reports for Thursday and Friday:**
   - The total number of reports received in one day (Thursday or Friday) is given as 2136.
   - There are two days (Thursday and Friday), so the total number of reports over these two days is:
     \[
     2136 + 2136 = 4272
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of reports for all five days combined:**
   - We know that the total number of reports received over the entire period is 5168.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of reports received on Wednesday.
   - Therefore, the equation representing the total number of reports over the five days is:
     \[
     3814 + x + 4272 = 5168
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine the known values:
     \[
     3814 + 4272 = 8086
     \]
   - Subtract this sum from the total number of reports:
     \[
     5168 - 8086 = -2918
     \]

Since the result (-2918) doesn't make sense in the context of the problem (as it's negative), there seems to be an error in the provided data or calculations. 

Given the current information, it appears there might have been an oversight in providing specific numbers for different days, leading to an incorrect calculation. Please verify the details provided to ensure accuracy. If you can provide corrected data, I would be happy to recalculate. 

However, based on the available information, if the total number of reports was indeed 5168, then no report was received on Wednesday since the sum of other days exceeds the total count.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} No report was received on Wednesday.<|im_end|>","Mon/Tues = 1907
Thur/Fri = 2136

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

**Step 1: Determine the total area of land that needs to be sold**

Abraham owns 80 square meters of land.

**Step 2: Calculate how much land he sells in the first transaction**

He sells half of his land at $50 per square meter:

\[
\text{Land Sold} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]
\[
\text{Money Earned} = 40 \times 50 = \$2000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much land he sells in the second transaction**

After the first sale, he has 40 square meters left. He sells another quarter of his remaining land at $30 per square meter:

\[
\text{Remaining Land After First Sale} = 40 \text{ square meters}
\]
\[
\text{Land Sold} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ square meters}
\]
\[
\text{Money Earned} = 10 \times 30 = \$300
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total money earned from selling all the land**

Total money earned from both sales:

\[
\$2000 + \$300 = \$2300
\]

**Final Answer:** Abraham will be able to earn **$2300** after selling all his unused land.<|im_end|>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.
After a month, he sold 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 square meters of his land.
So, the total land he already sold is 40+10= <<50=50>>50 square meters of his land.
He has 80 - 50 = <<80-50=30>>30 remaining land to be sold at $3 per square meter.
So he earned $3 x 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90 for that land.
Therefore, he earned a total of $50 + $30 + $90 = $<<50+30+90=170>>170.

2. **Subtract 10 from that value**:
   - Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age.

   - Tyrion changes his face mask twice.
   - He wears his mask for some period (let’s assume it’s one full day).
   - Therefore, he uses \(2\) face masks per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of face masks used over two days:**
   - Since he uses \(2\) face masks per day,
   - Over two days, he would use \(2 \times 2 = 4\) face masks.

3. **Final Answer:**

                    ! John collects , garbage from 3 ; different ; apartment complexes.  The . first : two have 200 apartments each and the ! last ? one ! is . 60% bigger , than . the other two ; combined. !  , He ; collects ? garbage , 3 ; times a week ; from each place . and he , gets paid $.40 ; per . collection . for each , apartment.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of apartments:**
   - There are 2 apartment complexes.
   - Each has 200 apartments.
   - Therefore, the total number of apartments is \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \).

2. **Determine the size difference between the last complex and the others:**
   - The last complex is 60% larger than the other two complexes.

Let's denote the number of apartments in the last complex as \( A \). Since it is 60% larger than the others, we can write:
\[ A = 200 + 0.6 \times 200 \]
\[ A = 200 + 120 \]
\[ A = 320 \]

So, the last complex has 320 apartments.

3. **Verify the total number of apartments:**
   - Summarizing all three complexes:
     \[ 200 (first) + 200 (second) + 320 (third) = 720 \]

This confirms that there must be an error in the calculation or provided data because the total should be 400 apartments, not 720. Let’s correct our approach:

Since the last complex is 60% larger, let’s consider its capacity more accurately:
\[ A = 200 + 0.6 \times 200 \]
\[ A = 200 + 120 \]
\[ A = 320 \]

But if the last complex has 320 apartments, then the remaining 80 apartments (from 200+200=400) would fit another structure, but since they don’t mention any other structures, we assume only these two complexes exist.

Therefore, the last complex must also contain 200 apartments (since 200+200=400), making it the same as the other two complexes.

Thus, the last complex indeed has 200 apartments.

4. **Calculate the total amount collected per week:**
   - John collects garbage 3 times a week.
   - For each apartment, he earns $0.40 per collection.

Now, calculate the earnings:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 200 \times 3 \times \$0.40 \]
\[ \text{Earnings} = 200 \times 1.20 \]
\[ \text{Earnings} = \$240 \]

5. **Calculate the total weekly earnings:**
   - John collects garbage from 3 different apartment complexes.
   - Each complex contributes equally based on their number of apartments.

So, his total earnings per week will be:
\[ \text{Total Weekly Earnings} = \$240 \]

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$240}
\]<|im_end|>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments

Let's break down the information provided to solve this problem:

1. **Initial number of fruits for different ages:**
   - A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
   - A 6-year-old avocado tree produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
   - A 7-year-old avocado tree produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
   - An 8-year-old avocado tree produces \(50 - 200 = -150\) fruits (since it produces 200 fewer than a 10-year-old).

2. **Fruit production in the first nine years:**
   - The ninth year saw no fruit production.

3. **Fruit production in the tenth year:**
   - After a nine-year period, a 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits from the first nine years.

Now let's calculate the total number of fruits produced over the 10-year period.

- First nine years: No fruits (9 years).
- Ninth year: No fruits.
- Tenth year: Since the tenth year tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits from the first nine years, we need to calculate the total number of fruits produced by the first nine years and multiply that by 20.

**Step-by-step calculation:**

1. Calculate the total number of fruits produced in the first nine years:
   - Year 1: 50 fruits
   - Year 2: 50 fruits
   - Year 3: 50 fruits
   - Year 4: 50 fruits
   - Year 5: 50 fruits
   - Year 6: 150 fruits
   - Year 7: 150 fruits
   - Year 8: 150 fruits
   - Year 9: No fruits

   Total fruits in the first nine years = \(50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 150 + 150 + 150 = 700\)

2. Calculate the total number of fruits produced in the tenth year:
   - A 10-year-old tree produces \(20 \times 700 = 14000\) fruits.

So, the total number of fruits produced by the avocado tree during its ten years of life is **14000**.<|im_end|>","At 5 years it produces 50 fruits

At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

3. The blue rope is ""7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope"". Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \). Then, \( B = Y - 7 \).

Now we know that the total length of all three ropes together is 37 cm. Therefore,
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

We can substitute \( R = 4B \) into the equation above:

\[ 4B + B + (Y - 7) = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 44 \]

From here, we have two expressions involving \( B \) and \( Y \):

1. \( B = \frac{R}{4} \)
2. \( Y = B + 7 \)

Since we don't have enough information to directly determine \( R \), let's express \( Y \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ Y = B + 7 \]

Substituting \( Y \) from the second expression into the first equation gives us:

\[ 5B + (B + 7) = 44 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 6B = 37 \]
\[ B = \frac{37}{6} \approx 6.17 \text{ cm} \]

Now we can find \( Y \):

\[ Y = B + 7 \]
\[ Y = \frac{37}{6} + 7 \]
\[ Y = \frac{37}{6} + \frac{42}{6} \]
\[ Y = \frac{89}{6} \approx 14.83 \text{ cm} \]

Finally, using \( R = 4B \):

\[ R = 4 \times \frac{37}{6} \]
\[ R = \frac{148}{6} \]
\[ R = \frac{74}{3} \approx 24.67 \text{ cm} \]

So, the length of the red rope is approximately **24.67** centimeters.<|im_end|>","Let Y = the length of the yellow rope in centimeters

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much money Rissa received initially:**
   - Rissa received three times as much as Ronnie.
   - If Ronnie received $5, then Rissa received \(3 \times 5 = \$15\).

2. **Calculate the total amount of money before they gave any away:**
   - Ronnie has $5.
   - Rissa has $15.
   - Together, they have \(5 + 15 = \$20\).

3. **Let \(x\) be the equal amount of money each person gives to their little sister.**
   - After giving this amount away, Rissa will have \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\).
   - We need to find \(x\) such that after giving \(x\) each time, Rissa ends up with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of what she originally had.

4. **Set up the equation based on the information provided:**
   - After giving \(x\) to her sister, Rissa should have \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15\).
   - This means \(Rissa\) has \(15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the right side: \(15 - x = \frac{60}{5} = 12\).
   - Therefore, \(x = 15 - 12 = 3\).

6. **Subtract \(x\) from both amounts to determine how much each person has left:**
   - After giving \(3\) dollars each, Ronnie has \(5 - 3 = \$2\).
   - Rissa has \(15 - 3 = \$12\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The amount left in Ronnie's money is $2.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $2.<|im_end|>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

This means she has given $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3.
Since Ronnie had given the same amount as Rissa, then Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $<<5-3=2>>2.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Equal Amounts of Colors**:
   - Red, White, Purple, Yellow.

2. **Total Paint Used**:
   - The total amount of paint used on the mural is 12 pints.

3. **Yellow Paint**:
   - Half of the mural is yellow.
   - Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

4. **Remaining Paint**:
   - Since half of the paint is yellow, the remaining half must be equally divided among the other three colors (red, white, and purple).
   - Therefore, the remaining paint after using yellow should be distributed among the other three colors equally.

5. **Paint Distribution**:
   - Let’s denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), purple paint as \( P \), and yellow paint as \( Y \).

Given that the total amount of paint used is 12 pints and the yellow paint used is 6 pints, we can set up the equation for the total paint used:

\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]

Substituting \( Y = 6 \):

\[ R + W + P + 6 = 12 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ R + W + P = 6 \]

Since the red, white, and purple paints are equal:

\[ R = W = P \]

Let’s denote the common value as \( x \). Thus,

\[ R = W = P = x \]

Now substituting back into our simplified equation:

\[ x + x + x = 6 \]
\[ 3x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{3} \]
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:

\[ \text{Red paint} = 2 \] pints.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of one bedroom
- Each bedroom measures \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.
- Since there are four bedrooms, the total area for all bedrooms combined is \(240 \times 4 = 960\) square feet.

### Step 2: Determine the area of the living room
- The living room is described as being 5 times larger than one bedroom.
- Therefore, the area of the living room is \(960 \times 5 = 4800\) square feet.

### Step 3: Find the total area of the house
- We know that the remaining part of the house is 1000 square feet.
- Adding up all parts, the total area of the house is \(960 + 4800 + 1000 = 7760\) square feet.

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Identify the initial condition**: On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Determine the increase pattern**: The number of puffs doubles each subsequent day from Tuesday to Friday.
   - Tuesday: \(3 \times 2 = 6\)
   - Wednesday: \(6 \times 2 = 12\)
   - Thursday: \(12 \times 2 = 24\)
   - Friday: \(24 \times 2 = 48\)

So far, we've calculated the number of puffs for each day:

- Monday: 3 puffs
- Tuesday: 6 puffs
- Wednesday: 12 puffs
- Thursday: 24 puffs
- Friday: 48 puffs

3. **Sum up the total number of puffs**: We add these numbers together to find the total number of puffs counted over the five days.
\[ 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 \]

4. **Perform the addition**:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
\[ 9 + 12 = 15 \]
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]
\[ 39 + 48 = 87 \]

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice has counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is \(\boxed{87}\).<|im_end|>","On Monday Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds in the sky, and double that on Tuesday, 3 x 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 puffs of clouds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of pods in the new box.
- The original box contains 100 pods.
- The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ \text{Additional pods} = 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 10 \]

So, the new box contains:
\[ 100 + 10 = 110 \text{ pods} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per pod.
- The total cost for 100 pods is $12.
- Therefore, the cost per pod is:
\[ \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many cycles can be done with one pod at the current rate.
- If we have 1 pod per cycle, then the number of cycles possible with one pod is:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{1}{0.12} \approx 8.33 \]

Since we can't perform a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Number of cycles} = 8 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of cycles for $1.
- We need to determine how many cycles can be performed with $1 using these pods.
- Since each pod costs $0.12, the number of pods we can buy with $1 is:
\[ \text{Number of pods} = \frac{1}{0.12} \approx 8.33 \]

Again, since we can't purchase a fraction of a pod, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[ \text{Number of pods} = 8 \]

Now, multiply the number of pods by the number of cycles per pod:
\[ \text{Total cycles} = 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, you can run **64 dishwashing cycles** for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.<|im_end|>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods

If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of $20 bills
Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills.
\[ \text{Number of } \$20\text{-bills} = \frac{\$1000}{\$20} = 50 \]

### Step 2: Account for lost bills
Thomas loses 10 bills while getting home.
\[ \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount paid for the bill
Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
\[ \text{Amount used for the bill} = \frac{40}{2} = \$20 \]
This means Thomas has \( \$20 \) left after paying for the bill.

### Step 4: Triple the remaining amount
Thomas then triples the remaining money.
\[ \text{New total} = 20 \times 3 = \$60 \]

### Step 5: Convert all bills to $5 bills
Finally, Thomas converts all his remaining bills into $5 bills.
Since he still has one bill (the one he used to buy the bill), we can calculate how many more $5 bills he gets from his remaining bills.
\[ \text{Total bills available for conversion} = 40 - 1 = 39 \] (since he already spent some on the bill)
\[ \text{Number of additional } \$5\text{-bills} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half.
- According to the information given, Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.
- Since Team A scores fewer goals than Team B, we can infer that Team B must have scored more goals in the first half.

Let's denote the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half as \(B_1\). Given that Team A scored fewer goals than Team B, we can write:
\[ B_1 > 4 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half.
- According to the information given, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half.
- Let’s denote the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half as \(B_2\).
- Therefore, the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half would be:
\[ A_2 = \frac{1}{4} \times B_2 \]

Since Team A scored 1 goal in the second half (as per the information provided), we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times B_2 = 1 \]
Solving for \(B_2\):
\[ B_2 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of goals scored by Team A in the first half.
- We know that Team A scored 4 goals in the first half.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of goals scored in the match.
- The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored by both teams over their respective halves.
- Goals scored by Team A:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Team A} = 4 (\text{first half}) + 1 (\text{second half}) = 5 \]
- Goals scored by Team B:
\[ \text{Goals scored by Team B} = 4 (\text{first half}) + 4 (\text{second half}) = 8 \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of goals scored in the match is:
\[ 5 (\text{Team A}) + 8 (\text{Team B}) = 13 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 13goals<|im_end|>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.

To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of chalk needed:**
   - The teacher can write 5 inches of chalk per day.
   - He needs 20% of this chalk each day to avoid recycling.

2. **Calculate the daily chalk usage:**
   - Chalk per day = 5 inches * 20% = 1 inch (since 5 inches * 20% = 1 inch).

3. **Calculate the total chalk usage over multiple days:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of days.
   - Total chalk used in \( n \) days = \( n \times 1 \) inch.

4. **Calculate the remaining chalk after \( n \) days:**
   - Remaining chalk after \( n \) days = \( n \times 1 \) inch.

5. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - According to the problem, the teacher ends up using 45% of the chalk by the end of the \( n \)-th day.
   - So, \( n \times 1 \leq 0.45 \times 5 \).
   - Simplifying, we get \( n \leq 2.25 \).

6. **Find the maximum integer value for \( n \):**
   - Since \( n \) must be an integer, the maximum value for \( n \) is 2.

7. **Verify if the teacher should start again at day 2 or continue further:**
   - At the end of the second day, the teacher will have less than 2 inches left.
   - Therefore, he should go back to using 20% of the chalk and start fresh from a new piece.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The teacher needs to start again from a new piece of chalk after 2 days because he has already reached the limit where he starts recycling the chalk again.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\).<|im_end|>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.
Since 1.76 is less than 2 inches, he will recycle this stick in 2 days.

                    question:
                    Miss Albert's class is ! composed of 12 boys and 12 ! girls. One-third of , the . girls ? and one-fourth of the ? boys are on varsity. ; How many students are not on : varsity?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of girls who are on varsity.
- There are 12 girls in total.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys who are on varsity.
- There are 12 boys in total.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \]

\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = 3 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of students who are on varsity.
- Add the number of girls on varsity to the number of boys on varsity.

\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 4 + 3 \]

\[ \text{Total number of students on varsity} = 7 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of students.
- The total number of students includes both boys and girls.

\[ \text{Total number of students} = 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} \]

\[ \text{Total number of students} = 24 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of students who are not on varsity.
- Subtract the total number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 \]

\[ \text{Number of students not on varsity} = 17 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 17}}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 students in Miss Albert's class.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine what percentage of James's teeth the dentist fixes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of teeth drilled:**
   - James initially has 30 teeth.
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.

2. **Calculate the number of teeth capped:**
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills.
     \[
     \text{Number of teeth capped} = \text{Number of teeth drilled} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of teeth fixed (drilled plus capped):**
   - Add the number of teeth drilled to the number of teeth capped.
     \[
     \text{Total teeth fixed} = \text{Number of teeth drilled} + \text{Number of teeth capped} = 4 + 11 = 15
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of teeth that the dentist fixes:**
   - Use the formula for percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Total teeth fixed}}{\text{Initial number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%

<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from sales:**
   - The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 4000 \times 3.5 = \$14,000
   \]

2. **Determine the number of gallons that have passed the expiry date:**
   - Mr. Marcellus realizes that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk has passed the expiry date.
   \[
   \text{Gallons Passed Expiry} = 4000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for these expired milk:**
   - The price per gallon of expired milk is still $3.5.
   \[
   \text{Cost of Expired Milk} = 1600 \times 3.5 = \$5,600
   \]

4. **Subtract the expired milk cost from the total revenue to find out how much was refunded:**
   \[
   \text{Refund Amount} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost of Expired Milk} = 14,000 - 5,600 = \$8,400
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $\boxed{8400}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current age of Colin given the relationship between their ages and the future ages mentioned.

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age.
   Let \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.

2. **Understand the first condition:**
   ""Wendy is five times what Colin will be in seven years.""
   
   This can be written mathematically as:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

3. **Understand the second condition:**
   ""In 25 years, Colin will be one-third as old as Wendy.""

   This can be written mathematically as:
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} (W + 25)
   \]

4. **Simplify the second equation:**
   Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   3(C + 25) = W + 25
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   3C + 75 = W + 25
   \]

5. **Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the simplified second equation:**
   From the first equation, substitute \( W \):
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5(C + 7) + 25
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 35 + 25
   \]
   Combine like terms on the right side:
   \[
   3C + 75 = 5C + 60
   \]

6. **Isolate \( C \):**
   Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
   \[
   75 = 2C + 60
   \]
   Subtract 60 from both sides:
   \[
   15 = 2C
   \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[
   C = \frac{15}{2}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   C = 7.5

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how much money Bob has in total:**
   Bob spends $27,000.

2. **Calculate the cost of one book at the bookstore:**
   The bookstore sells books for $500.

3. **Calculate the number of books Bob can buy with his entire budget:**
   To find out how many books Bob can buy with his total amount, we divide his total spending by the price per book.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = \frac{\$27,000}{\$500}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} = 54
   \]
   
So, Bob can buy 54 books in total with his $27,000.

5. **Distribute these books among three schools equally:**
   Since there are three schools, we need to divide the total number of books by 3.
   
   \[
   \text{Books per school} = \frac{54}{3} = 18

Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school.

To solve this problem, let's break down the sequence of events:

1. **First event**: Two apples fell from the tree.
   - **Action**: One landed on Newton's head.

2. **Second event**: Newton picked up two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other into the tree.
   - **Action**: Five more apples fell from the tree.

3. **Third event**: Newton picked up all but one apple, threw the remaining one at the tree, and then picked up all the remaining apples and went home.

- **Apple 3**: Landed on Newton's head (event 1), then thrown into the tree (event 2), then thrown again at the tree (event 3)

Now we can determine how many apples were left after each action:
- After event 1: 2 apples left.
- After event 2: 1 apple left (because one was already on Newton's head).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slice portions eaten by Kate's friends**

- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total slices from friends = \( 6 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} \)

\[ 
= 36 \text{ slices}
\]

- Each friend also eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total slices from friends for pepperoni = \( 4 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends} \)

\[ 
= 24 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 2: Sum up all the slices eaten**

- Cheese pizza slices: 36
- Pepperoni pizza slices: 24

Total slices needed = \( 36 + 24 \)

\[ 
= 60 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the number of whole pizzas required**

- Each cheese pizza has 12 slices.
- Each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices.

Since both types have different numbers of slices per pie, we cannot directly divide the total slices needed (60) by either type of pizza without considering combinations.

Let's check if buying one more cheese or one more pepperoni will suffice:

- Buying two cheese pizzas would give \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) slices.
- Buying three cheese pizzas would give \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) slices.

Clearly, neither combination gives us exactly 60 slices because it doesn't account for any leftover slices that could be combined.

**Conclusion:**
Given the constraints, Kate must buy at least **two cheese pizzas** and possibly one extra pepperoni pizza to cover her friends' consumption while ensuring she has enough left over for herself and additional guests. 

Therefore, the minimum number of pies she needs to buy is **three**.

{The final answer is} Three pies.<|im_end|>","Kate’s friends eat 6 x 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 cheese pizza slices.

1. **Calculate the distance Sam runs from Monday to Friday:**
   - Sam runs 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
   - Number of days he runs = 3 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday).
   - Distance per day = 3 miles.
   - Total distance for these three days = \(3 \times 3 = 9\) miles.

2. **Calculate the distance Sam runs on Tuesday and Thursday:**
   - Sam runs 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.
   - Number of days he runs = 2 (Tuesday, Thursday).
   - Distance per day = 5 miles.
   - Total distance for these two days = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) miles.

3. **Sum the distances from all days:**
   - Total distance = Distance from Monday to Friday + Distance from Tuesday to Thursday.
   - Total distance = \(9\) miles + \(10\) miles = \(19\) miles.

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran during the week is:

{The final answer is} 19 miles.<|im_end|>","On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Mike ran 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 miles

                    question:
                    Jay is making snowballs to prepare for a ? snowball fight with his sister. He can : build 20 ; snowballs in an ? hour, ? but , 2 . melt every 15 minutes. How long ! will it take ? before he has . 60 . snowballs?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay can make in one hour and then calculate how long it will take him to reach or exceed 60 snowballs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of snowballs Jay can make in one hour.
Jay can make 20 snowballs per hour.

Step 2: Determine the rate at which Jay melts snowballs.
Jay melts 2 snowballs every 15 minutes. To find out how many snowballs he melts per minute, we divide 2 by 15:

\[ \text{Snowballs melted per minute} = \frac{2}{15} \]

Step 3: Convert the melting rate from snowballs per minute to snowballs per hour.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the melting rate by 60:

\[ \text{Snowballs melted per hour} = \left(\frac{2}{15}\right) \times 60 \]
\[ \text{Snowballs melted per hour} = \frac{120}{15} \]
\[ \text{Snowballs melted per hour} = 8 \]

So, Jay melts 8 snowballs every hour.

Step 4: Calculate the net change in the number of snowballs over time.
Since Jay makes snowballs at a constant rate (20 per hour) and melts them at a different rate (8 per hour), we subtract the melting rate from the building rate to get the net increase in the number of snowballs:

\[ \text{Net increase per hour} = 20 - 8 = 12 \]

Step 5: Determine how many hours it takes to reach or exceed 60 snowballs.
We start with 0 snowballs and add 12 snowballs per hour until we reach or exceed 60 snowballs:

\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{60 - 0}{12} \]
\[ \text{Hours needed} = \frac{60}{12} \]
\[ \text{Hours needed} = 5 \]

Therefore, it will take Jay 5 hours before he has more than 60 snowballs.

The final answer is: The final answer is 5.<|im_end|>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between John and Jim**:
   - The problem states that when ""It"" (presumably referring to the 20th anniversary) comes out, John is twice as old as Jim.

2. **Determine John's age at the time of the 20th anniversary**:
   - We know that John is currently 28 years old.
   - At the time of the 20th anniversary, John will be 38 years old (since he is already 28).

3. **Calculate Jim's age based on their relative ages**:
   - According to the statement, when ""It"" comes out, John is twice as old as Jim.
   - Let Jim's current age be \( J \).
   - Therefore, John's age in relation to Jim's age can be expressed as: \( J = 2J \).

4. **Solve for Jim's age**:
   - From the equation \( J = 2J \), we can see that there is no direct way to isolate \( J \). However, since we know John's current age is 28, we can use this information directly.
   - Since John is 38 at the time of the 20th anniversary, and he is twice as old as Jim, Jim must be half his age.
   - So, if John is 28, then Jim would be \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \).

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - At the time of the 20th anniversary, John is indeed 38, which is twice Jim's age (14).

Therefore, Jim is 14 years old.

**Final Answer**: Jim is 14 years old.<|im_end|>","When Digimon came out John would have been 28-20=<<28-20=8>>8

- **Doxa**: 
  - Doxa ate 1 slice.

- **Sister**:
  - The sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa.
    - So, the sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.

- **Brother**:
  - The brother ate 1 more slice than the sister.

                    A nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses ; used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bandages were initially ordered and then account for the usage over the three days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of bandages ordered on the first day
- The nurses used 38 bandages on the first day.
- They ordered one bulk pack on the first day.

Since a bulk pack contains 50 bandages, ordering one pack means they have:
\[ 50 \text{ bandages} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of bandages used on the second day
- The nurses used 10 fewer bandages than they did on the first day.
- Therefore, on the second day, they used:
\[ 38 - 10 = 28 \text{ bandages} \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of bandages remaining after the second day
- After using 28 bandages on the second day, the total number of bandages available is:
\[ 50 + 28 = 78 \text{ bandages} \]
This matches the information given that there were 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

### Step 4: Determine the number of bandages ordered on the third day
- On the third day, the nurses ordered two full bulk packs (since they had no remainder from the previous order).
- Ordering two packs means they have:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ bandages} \]

### Step 5: Determine the number of bandages used on the third day
- On the third day, they used half a pack, so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ bandages} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the initial number of bandages
- We know that after the third day, there are 78 bandages left.
- This leaves us with the equation:
\[ \text{Initial Bandages} - (\text{Bandages Used on Day 1}) - (\text{Bandages Used on Day 2}) - (\text{Bandages Used on Day 3}) = 78 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \text{Initial Bandages} - 38 - 28 - 25 = 78 \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Initial Bandages} - 91 = 78 \]

Finally, solving for the Initial Bandages:
\[ \text{Initial Bandages} = 78 + 91 \]
\[ \text{Initial Bandages} = 169 \]

Therefore, the nurse started with **169 bandages** on the first day.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.

Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of inches in May's hair.
May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.

Number of inches = Ending length - Starting length
= 8 inches - 10 inches
= -2 inches (This result doesn't make sense because we can't have negative lengths. Let's re-evaluate our approach.)

Let's correct this and proceed:

- The starting point is actually 10 inches from the beginning of the hair growth cycle.
- The ending point should be after she has finished growing out to that length.

Since she had her hair cut and colored, we need to consider only the cutting part where she stops growing before reaching her desired end length.

So, if we assume she stopped growing when her hair reached the length of the haircut plus any extra length added during the coloring process, then we'll need to add some additional length based on the color.

Given that she got a haircut costing $30 per inch and the total cost was $40, we can calculate the length of hair cut as follows:

Total cost = Number of inches * Cost per inch
$40 = Number of inches * $30

Number of inches = $40 / $30
Number of inches = 1.33 inches (approximately)

However, since hair grows continuously throughout its length, we must also account for the fact that the hair grew longer than just the amount cut. 

Let's denote the original length of the hair as \( L \). After cutting, the new length will be \( L + x \), where \( x \) is the additional length due to the color. Given that she originally had 10 inches and the haircut cost $30 per inch, the total length after cutting would be \( 10 + 1.33 \approx 11.33 \) inches. 

But considering the full length growth and the coloring, we need to include the additional length gained from the color. Since the color itself does not specify an exact length but rather increases the overall hair length, we assume that the entire length of the hair was covered by the coloring process.

Thus, the total length of hair after coloring is approximately 16 inches (since $40 is spent on color, and assuming it covers the full length).

Now, let's recalculate the length of hair cut:

Starting length = 10 inches
Ending length = 16 inches
Length cut = Ending length - Starting length
= 16 inches - 10 inches
= 6 inches

Now, we know the haircut cost $30 per inch, so:

Cost of haircut = Length cut * Cost per inch
Cost of haircut = 6 inches * $30
Cost of haircut = $180

Next, we need to determine the cost of the color. We already know the total cost is $40, and the haircut cost $180, which means the remaining cost goes towards the color.

Remaining cost = Total cost - Cost of haircut
Remaining cost = $40 - $180
Remaining cost = -$140 (This indicates an error in our previous calculation; the total cost should cover both the haircut and the color, so let's correct it.)

Since the total cost is $40, and the haircut is $180, we need to subtract the haircut cost from the total cost to find the color cost:

Color cost = Total cost - Haircut cost
Color cost = $40 - $180
Color cost = -$140 (Again, this indicates an error in our calculations.)

Correcting the calculation:

Color cost = Total cost - Color cost
$40 = $40 - Color cost
Color cost = $40 - $40
Color cost = $0

Therefore, the color cost is $0.

Finally, we sum up the cost of the haircut and the color:

Final cost = Cost of haircut + Color cost
Final cost = $180 + $0
Final cost = $180

Thus, the final answer is: {The final answer is} $180.<|im_end|>","She had 2 inches cut because 10-8=<<10-8=2>>2

To determine how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her regular pay first and then add any bonuses based on her attendance.

**Step 1: Calculate Jen's daily earnings**

Jen works 7.5 hours per day and earns $1.5 per hour.
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = 7.5 \times 1.5 = \$11.25 \]

Since she works 6 days a week:
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = 11.25 \times 6 = \$68.25 \]

Now let's move to Step 2: Calculate her total earnings over 4 weeks.

**Step 2: Calculate weekly earnings over 4 weeks**

Her weekly earnings remain the same at $68.25.
\[ \text{Total Weekly Earnings Over 4 Weeks} = 68.25 \times 4 = \$273.00 \]

Next, let's proceed to Step 3: Calculate the bonus if she had no absences.

**Step 3: Calculate the bonus (if applicable)**

If Jen has no absences, she does not earn the extra $10 bonus.
\[ \text{Bonus} = \$0 \]

Finally, we'll reach our conclusion:

**Step 4: Add the bonus to her total earnings**

\[ \text{Total Amount Received} = 273.00 + 0 = \$273.00 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Laundry Earnings:**
   - Jason does laundry once per week.
   - He earns $3.00 for doing laundry.

2. **Trash Removal Earnings:**
   - Jason takes trash out to the curb twice per week.
   - He earns $1.50 for each time he takes out the trash.

   Calculation for Trash Removal:

   \]

5. **Two-Week Total Earnings:**
   Since Jason works over a two-week period, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
   \[
   \$9.00 \times 2 = \$18.00

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant.

2. **After 10:00:**
   - Another group of 40 people entered and ordered the same amount of food as the first group (50 people).

   Let's calculate the total for this time period:
   \[
   \text{Total before evening} = 50 + 40 = 90 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Evening Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 (i.e., 80 people) entered the restaurant.

   Adding these entries:
   \[
   \text{Total after evening entry} = 90 + 80 = 170 \text{ people}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is \boxed{170}.<|im_end|>","The number of people who came in at lunch is twice the number that came in at 10:00: 2 * 40 people = <<2*40=80>>80 people.

The total number of people who entered the restaurant was 80 people + 150 people + 50 people + 40 people = <<80+150+50+40=320>>320 people.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of packs of black pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - She bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens.

2. **Calculate the total number of packs of red pens:**
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens = \( 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ pens} \).

3. **Calculate the number of black pens:**
   - Since she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens,
     \[
     \text{Number of black pens} = 2 \times \text{Number of red pens} = 2 \times 25 \text{ pens} = 50 \text{ pens}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pens:**
   - Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
     \[
     \text{Total number of pens} = 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens}
     \]

So, Alain has a total of 75 pens. 

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 75.<|im_end|>","Alain has a total of 5 x 5= <<5*5=25>>25 red pens.
And he has a total of 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 packs of black pens.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and calculate each step carefully.

### Step 1: Determine the cost per bottle of Scotch
John buys 10 bottles of Scotch at a total cost of $600.
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of Scotch} = \frac{\$600}{10} = \$60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bottles of cognac John buys
He buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of Scotch.
\[
\text{Number of bottles of cognac} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

### Step 3: Determine the cost per bottle of cognac
Scotch costs $60 per bottle, so cognac, which is 50% more expensive, would be:
\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = \$60 + (0.5 \times \$60) = \$60 + \$30 = \$90
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cognac
John buys 20 bottles of cognac at $90 per bottle.
\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times \$90 = \$1800
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount spent on everything
Now, add the cost of the Scotch and the cognac together.
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$600 (\text{Scotch}) + \$1800 (\text{Cognac}) = \$2400
\]

### Final Answer
Therefore, John spends a total of $\boxed{2400}$ on everything.<|im_end|>","The scotch cost $600/10=$<<600/10=60>>60 each
He bought 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac
Each bottle cost .5*60=$<<.5*60=30>>30 more than the scotch
So they cost $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90
That means he spent $90*20=$<<90*20=1800>>1800 on the cognac
So he spent a total of $600+$1800=$<<600+1800=2400>>2400

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days.

### Step 1: Determine the number of trees planted on the first day
Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.

### Step 2: Determine the number of trees planted on the second day
On the second day, Mr. Julius planted:
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees.
- An additional 10 more White Oak trees.

Since he planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day, he would plant:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees} \]

And an additional 10 White Oak trees on the second day:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted on the second day would be:

\[ 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} + 30 \text{ (White Oak)} = 70 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 3: Sum up all the trees planted over the two days
First day: \( 20 \) White Oak trees
Second day: \( 40 \) Lodgepole Pine trees + \( 30 \) White Oak trees

Total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days is:

\[ 20 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.

At the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.
The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.

2. **First Day**:
   - Fred puts 24 gallons in the refrigerator.
   - He puts 24 gallons in the cooler.
   
   Total: \( 24 \text{ gallons} + 24 \text{ gallons} = 48 \text{ gallons} \)

3. **Second Day**:
   - His wife Barbie drinks 4 gallons.
   - She spills 7 gallons.
   
   Total after spill: \( (24 \text{ gallons} - 4 \text{ gallons}) + (24 \text{ gallons} - 7 \text{ gallons}) = 20 \text{ gallons} \)

4. **Third Day**:
   - Fred's friend Ronnie visits and takes 5 gallons.

5. **Fourth Day**:
   - 3 people (Fred, his wife, and another guest) share the remaining root beer.
   - Each person gets an equal share of \( \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{3} = 5 \text{ gallons} \).

6. **Total Available for Party**:
   - Since there were three people sharing the remaining root beer, each person would get 5 gallons.

Therefore, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink at the party is \( \boxed{5 \text{ gallons}} \).<|im_end|>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs.

2. **Set Up Equation Based on Given Information:**
   According to the problem, eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs equals 40.
   
   Therefore, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     4x = 40 - 8
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     4x = 32
     \]
   - Then, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{32}{4}
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of fish that have red stripes**

- We know there are 66 fish total.
- One-third of these fish have red stripes.

\[ \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 \]

\[
= \frac{66}{3}
\]

\[
= 22
\]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for those with red stripes**

- Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish.

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 \]

\[
= 44
\]

So, 44 fish remain.

**Step 3: Determine the number of fish that have blue stripes**

- Now we need to find out what fraction of the remaining fish (those without red stripes) have blue stripes.

\[ \text{Fraction of remaining fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \]

- Multiply this fraction by the remaining number of fish (44).

\[ \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 \]

\[
= \frac{5 \times 44}{11}
\]

\[
= \frac{220}{11}
\]

\[
= 20
\]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes**

- Add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes.

\[ \text{Total fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 \]

\[
= 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is 42.<|im_end|>","One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of eyeshadow palettes**:
   - Amy has 2 eyeshadow palettes.
   
2. **Number of eyeshadow colors per palette**:
   - Each palette contains 4 colors.

3. **Total initial number of eyeshadow colors**:
   \[
   2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
   \]

4. **Number of makeup sets**:
   - Amy initially has 3 makeup sets.

5. **Colors in each makeup set**:
   - Each makeup set contains 6 colors.

6. **Total number of colors available to Amy before any were stolen or used**:
   \[
   8 \text{ colors (from palettes)} + 3 \text{ colors (sets)} = 11 \text{ colors}
   \]

7. **Amy's sister steals one palette**:
   - She steals 4 colors from one palette.
   - The remaining palette now contains:
     \[
     4 \text{ colors (original) } - 4 \text{ colors (stolen) } = 0 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of colors left after her sister steals one palette is:
     \[
     8 \text{ colors (remaining from original palettes)} + 3 \text{ colors (sets)} = 11 \text{ colors}
     \]

8. **Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set**:
   - There are 3 makeup sets, so half of one set would be:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ colors} = 3 \text{ colors}
     \]

9. **Final calculation**:
   - Subtracting the used colors from the remaining total:
     \[
     11 \text{ colors} - 3 \text{ colors (used)} = 8 \text{ colors}

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Mattison's height**:
   - Mattison is 60 inches tall.

2. **Height of his house**:
   - His house is 7 times taller than Mattison.
   - Therefore, the total height of his house = \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 7 \).

3. **Calculate the height of Mattison's house**:
   - Height of the house = \( 420 \text{ inches} \) (since \( 60 \times 7 = 420 \)).

4. **Height difference between floors**:
   - The distance between the top of one floor and the bottom of the next floor is equal to Mattison's height, which is 60 inches.

5. **Height of the first floor from the ground**:
   - Since the first floor is three times taller than Mattison, we need to calculate this height.
   - First floor height = \( 60 \text{ inches} \times 3 \).

6. **Calculate the height of the first floor**:
   - Height of the first floor = \( 180 \text{ inches} \).

7. **Height of the roof from the second floor**:
   - We already know that the roof is 60 inches above the first floor.
   - Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor = \( 60 \text{ inches} \).

So, the final answer is: The roof is 60 inches high from the second floor.<|im_end|>","Mattison's two-story house is 60 x 7 = <<60*7=420>>420 inches high.

                    question:
                    Twenty tourists discovered 700 shells in a strip mall parking lot. They had divided into three groups, Alphas, The finders, and Gogetters to find as many shells as possible. If team Alphas found 40% of the shells, and ; team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, how many shells did team Gogetters find?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of shells that each group found based on their respective percentages.

1. **Calculate the number of shells found by Team Alphas:**
   - Total shells = 700
   - Percentage found by Alphas = 40%
   - Number of shells found by Alphas = \( 700 \times 0.40 = 280 \)

2. **Determine the remaining shells after Alphas have found their share:**
   - Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
   - Remaining shells = \( 700 - 280 = 420 \)

3. **Calculate the number of shells found by Team The Finders:**
   - Percentage found by The Finders = 60%
   - Number of shells found by The Finders = \( 420 \times 0.60 = 252 \)

4. **Determine the remaining shells after The Finders have found their share:**
   - Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by The Finders
   - Remaining shells = \( 700 - 252 = 448 \)

5. **Calculate the number of shells found by Team Gogetters:**
   - Remaining shells = 448 (which is exactly what was left after both teams were accounted for)
   - Since there are no other teams mentioned, it implies that Gogetters found all remaining shells.
   - Therefore, Number of shells found by Gogetters = 448

Thus, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 448 shells.<|im_end|>","Team Alphas found 40/100*700 = <<40/100*700=280>>280 shells.
If team Alphas found 280 shells, the other teams found 700-280 = 420 shells.
Team The Finders found 60% of the remaining shells, a total of 60/100*420 = <<60/100*420=252>>252 shells.
If The finders found 252 shells, team Gogetters found 420-252 = 168 shells.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To determine how many miles the last dog needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of miles walked by all four dogs**:
   - Dog 1: Walks 1 mile per day.
   - Dog 2: Walks 4 miles per day.
   - Dog 3: Walks 3 miles per day.

   Total miles = (Dog 1) + (Dog 2) + (Dog 3)
                  = 1 + 4 + 3
                  = 8 miles

2. **Determine the average daily walking distance for all four dogs**:
   - There are 4 dogs in total.
   - The total miles walked by all dogs is 8 miles.

   Average miles per dog per day = Total miles / Number of dogs
                                 = 8 / 4
                                 = 2 miles

3. **Verify that this average matches the given information**:
   - According to the problem, on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day.
   - This means that each dog walks an equal share of the total miles, including the last dog.

Since the average is already calculated as 2 miles per dog, it confirms that the last dog also walks 2 miles per day.

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk \boxed{2} miles per day.<|im_end|>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of the loan.
2. Determine how much of that loan is used to pay off debts.
3. Subtract both amounts from the total value of the house to find out how much money John has left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the Loan Amount
John gets a loan worth 40% of the value of his house.

- The value of John’s house = $250,000
- Loan amount = 40% of $250,000

\[ \text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

So, John's loan is $100,000.

### Step 2: Determine How Much Is Used for Debts
He uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

- Loan amount = $100,000
- Amount used for debts = 60% of $100,000

\[ \text{Amount used for debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

So, John pays off $60,000 in debt.

### Step 3: Calculate How Much Money He Has Left
Subtract both the loan amount and the amount paid off for debts from the value of the house.

- Value of the house = $250,000
- Amount paid off for debts = $60,000

\[ \text{Money left} = 250,000 - 100,000 - 60,000 \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 250,000 - 160,000 \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 90,000 \]

So, John has $90,000 left after paying off his debts.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{90,000}
\]<|im_end|>","His loan is worth 250,000*.4=$<<250000*.4=100000>>100,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total weight of the tunas caught:**
   - The weights of the tunas are given as follows:
     - First tuna (Monday): 56 kg
     - Second tuna: 46 kg
     - Third tuna: 26 kg
   - Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg = 128 kg

2. **Calculate the cost per kilogram of tuna:**
   - We know that one kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.
   
3. **Calculate the total earnings from selling all the tunas:**
   - Since there are three tunas, we can calculate the earnings as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Weight} \times \text{Cost Per Kilogram}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 128 \, \text{kg} \times \$0.50/\text{kg} = \$64.00
     \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn a total of $64.00 after selling all the tunas to the market.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{\$64.00}$<|im_end|>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.
He will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.
And he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the buying price per magazine.
2. Calculate the selling price per magazine based on the given ratio.
3. Compute the profit.

Step 1: Determine the buying price per magazine.
Trinity buys the magazines for $72. Let's denote the number of magazines as \( n \). The total cost (buying price) is then \( n \times 72 \).

Since the problem does not specify how many magazines were bought, let's assume she bought one magazine for simplicity. Therefore, the buying price per magazine is $72 / 1 = $72.

Step 2: Calculate the selling price per magazine.
According to the problem, Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 times the price she bought them. So, the selling price per magazine is:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{11}{8} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 9 \times 11 = 99 \]
So, the selling price per magazine is $99.

Step 3: Compute the profit.
Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the buying price. Since the problem only mentions one magazine being sold, the profit would be:
\[ \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the dehumidifier removes at different settings over a specified period.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Low Speed (Low Setting):**
   - Removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
     \[
     \text{Water removed} = 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. **Medium Speed (Medium Setting):**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the low speed.
     \[
     \text{Water removed per day} = 2 \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 2 \text{ liters/day}
     \]
   - Brian runs it for 3 days.
     \[
     \text{Water removed} = 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **High Speed (High Setting):**
   - Removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.
     \[
     \text{Water removed per day} = 2 \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 4 \text{ liters/day}
     \]
   - Brian runs it for 5 days.
     \[
     \text{Water removed} = 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}
     \]

4. **Total Water Removed:**
   - Sum up all the water removed from the low, medium, and high settings.
     \[
     \text{Total water removed} = 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total volume of the second medicine per dose.
- The first medicine has a volume of 14 mL.
- The second medicine is 3 times the volume of the first medicine.

So, the volume of the second medicine per dose can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Volume of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \, \text{mL} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume of both medicines for one dose.
Now we add the volumes of both medicines together to find out how much medicine is needed for one dose:
\[ \text{Total volume of one dose} = \text{Volume of first medicine} + \text{Volume of second medicine} \]
\[ \text{Total volume of one dose} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 14 + 42 = 56 \, \text{mL} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume of all eight doses.
Since there are 8 doses, we multiply the total volume of one dose by 8:
\[ \text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 56 \, \text{mL/dose} \times 8 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 56 \times 8 = 448 \, \text{mL} \]

### Final Answer:
The total volume of medicine required for 8 doses is \(448\) mL.<|im_end|>","First medicine = <<14=14>>14 mL

- Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

Step 2: Determine the capacity of John's first class.
- John's first class has half the capacity of Ali's class.
\[ \text{Capacity of John's first class} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Capacity of John's first class} = 60 \]

Step 3: Determine the capacity of John's second class.
- John's second class also has half the capacity of Ali's class.
\[ \text{Capacity of John's second class} = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Capacity of John's second class} = 60 \]

Step 4: Sum the capacities of both classes at John's school.
\[ \text{Combined capacity of John's classes} = 60 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Combined capacity of John's classes} = 120 \]

Step 5: Determine the total combined capacity of both schools.
- Since only John's two classes are considered for now (Ali's class is not included), we add John's combined capacity to himself.
\[ \text{Total combined capacity of both schools} = 120 \]

Final Answer: The combined capacity of both schools is \(120\) students.<|im_end|>","Each of John’s classes has a capacity of 120 * 1/8 = <<120*1/8=15>>15 students.

4. Add the 2% interest to this remaining amount to get the full amount that needs to be paid back.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen owes after adding the 2% interest.
The principal amount Stephen borowed is $300. The interest rate is 2%, so the interest added is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
Therefore, the total amount Stephen owes is:
\[ \text{Total Amount Owing} = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much Stephen has already given to his sister over the first 11 months.
Stephen gives $25 per month for 11 months, so:
\[ \text{Amount Given} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the amount already given from the total amount owing to find out how much remains unpaid at the end of the 11th month.
The remaining amount after giving $25 per month for 11 months is:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = 306 - 275 = 31 \]

### Step 4: Add the 2% interest to this remaining amount to get the full amount that needs to be paid back.
The interest on the remaining amount of $31 is:
\[ \text{Interest} = 31 \times 0.02 = 0.62 \]
So, the total amount that needs to be paid back in the twelfth month is:
\[ \text{Twelfth Month Payment} = 31 + 0.62 = 31.62 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{31.62}
\]<|im_end|>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.

For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

                    question:
                    Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the , diapers.  How ! many diapers . does Jordan change per day?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of Children**: Jordan has 2 children.
2. **Diaper Changes Per Child per Day**: Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.

First, calculate the total number of diaper changes required for both children per day:
\[ \text{Total diaper changes per day} = (\text{Number of children}) \times (\text{Diaper changes per child per day}) \]
\[ \text{Total diaper changes per day} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, we need to account for the fact that Jordan’s wife changes half of these diapers. So, we divide the total number of diaper changes by two:
\[ \text{Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day} = \frac{\text{Total diaper changes per day}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Since this value represents the number of diapers Jordan's wife changes, it doesn't directly give us the number of diapers Jordan changes. However, since Jordan's wife changes half of what Jordan needs to change (because she only changes half), we can conclude that Jordan changes twice as many diapers as his wife does.

Therefore, Jordan changes:
\[ \text{Diapers changed by Jordan per day} = 2 \times (\text{Diapers changed by Jordan's wife per day}) \]
\[ \text{Diapers changed by Jordan per day} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

So, Jordan changes **10 diapers** per day.<|im_end|>","Jordan has 2 children, each requiring 5 diaper changes per day, for a total of 5*2=<<2*5=10>>10 diaper changes per day.
Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, leaving Jordan to change the other half, for a total of 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 diaper changes per day that Jordan is responsible for.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the jar.
2. Determine how many jelly beans fit into the jar based on the given information.
3. Use the given percentages to estimate the number of red jelly beans.
4. Compare his guess to the actual number of red jelly beans.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Jar

The jar is a rectangular prism (a cube), so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cube:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given dimensions:
- Length \( l = 6 \) inches
- Width \( w = 6 \) inches
- Height \( h = 15 \) inches

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 54 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 810 \text{ cubic inches} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Jelly Beans That Fit in the Jar

We know that each jelly bean occupies approximately 15 cubic inches. So, the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Volume per jelly bean}} \]

\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{810}{15} \]
\[ \text{Number of jelly beans} = 54 \]

### Step 3: Estimate the Number of Red Jelly Beans Based on Efficiency

We know that jelly beans have an estimated efficiency of 80%. This means only 80% of the jelly beans will actually be red. Therefore, the estimated number of red jelly beans is:

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = \text{Total number of jelly beans} \times 0.80 \]

\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 54 \times 0.80 \]
\[ \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 43.2 \]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round it down to 43 because you can't have a fraction of a jelly bean.

### Step 4: Compare His Guess to the Actual Number

Tim's guess was 900 red jelly beans. The actual number of red jelly beans is 43.

To find out how far off his guess was, we calculate the difference between his guess and the actual number:

\[ \text{Difference} = |\text{Actual number} - \text{Guess}| \]

\[ \text{Difference} = |43 - 900| \]
\[ \text{Difference} = |-857| \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 857 \]

Therefore, Tim’s guess was **857** units off from the actual number of red jelly beans.<|im_end|>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

                    question:
                    A bus has a capacity of 200 people. When it departed ; Chengli city, it had 20 people. On , the first stop, ; 40 people : entered the bus.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the initial conditions:**
   - The bus's capacity is 200 people.
   - At departure from Chengli City, there were 20 people.

2. **Calculate the number of people after the first stop (first station):**
   - People entering at the first stop = 40
   - Total people after first stop = Initial people + People entering = 20 + 40 = 60

3. **Calculate the number of people after the second stop (second station):**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people that enter at the second station.
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the people entering at the first station enter at the second station.
   - Therefore, \( x = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 \)
     \[
     x = 30
     \]
   - Total people after second stop = 60 + 30 = 90

4. **Calculate the number of people after the third stop (third station):**
   - Let \( y \) be the number of people that enter at the third station.
   - According to the problem, the number of people doubling at the third station.
   - After the third stop, the bus should be filled up to its capacity, so:
     \[
     y \times 2 = 200
     \]
     Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{200}{2} = 100
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of people required to fill the remaining space:**
   - We know that the bus needs to have exactly 200 people in total to reach full capacity.
   - Since 90 people are already on board after the second stop, the number of additional people needed to reach the bus's capacity is:
     \[
     200 - 90 = 110
     \]

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is **110**.<|im_end|>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.

                    question:
                    : Pauline visits ! her favorite local . museum three times a year. The cost . of , one ; visit is ? $2. : After 5 years, ! the cost ? of one . visit , has increased ? by 150%, ; but Pauline ? decided not ! to ? give ; up . any visit ? and continued , to go to ? the museum for ; 3 ; more ? years. How much did . Pauline spend : on all visits to the museum?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the initial cost per visit.
Pauline visits the museum three times a year. If we assume that the cost remains constant over time, then the cost of one visit initially would be:

\[ \text{Initial Cost per Visit} = \$2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of visits in five years.
Since Pauline visits the museum three times a year, in five years she will have visited:

\[ \text{Total Visits in 5 Years} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

### Step 3: Determine the increase in cost after 5 years.
After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%. This means the new cost per visit is twice the original cost (since 150% increase means it becomes 200% or double):

\[ \text{New Cost per Visit} = 2 \times \$2 = \$4 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent over 5 years.
To find out how much Pauline spent over these 5 years, we multiply the total number of visits by the new cost per visit:

\[ \text{Total Amount Spent} = 15 \times \$4 = \$60 \]

### Step 5: Determine the additional visits made after 5 years.
Pauline continues visiting the museum for an additional 3 years beyond the first 5 years. Since she still goes to the museum three times a year during this period:

\[ \text{Additional Visits} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount spent over the additional 3 years.
For the additional 3 years, she also spends at the same new cost ($4 per visit), so:

\[ \text{Amount Spent in Additional 3 Years} = 9 \times \$4 = \$36 \]

### Final Calculation:
Now, let’s add the amounts from both periods to get the total amount spent over the entire duration:

\[ \text{Total Amount Spent} = \$60 + \$36 = \$96 \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is:

**The final answer is:** \$96.<|im_end|>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

To determine how long it will take for all 10 groups to complete the escape room challenge, let's break down the process:

1. **Determine the number of groups that can participate**: 
   - There are 45 minutes available.
   - Each group gets 45 minutes.
   - Since there are 10 groups, we need to see if all 10 groups can fit into the given time.

2. **Calculate the total time required**:
   - If each group takes exactly 45 minutes, then the maximum number of groups that can be accommodated within the 45-minute limit is \( \frac{45}{45} = 1 \) group per minute.

3. **Check if this fits within the constraints**:
   - With 10 groups, since each group needs 45 minutes, only one group can actually use its allotted time without exceeding the 45-minute mark.

Given these calculations, since each group requires 45 minutes and only 1 group can use its allocated time, no additional groups can be accommodated beyond the initial setup.

Therefore, it would not be possible to accommodate more than 1 group due to the limited time.

**Final Answer**:
It will take 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room because each group must wait until the previous group completes its task, ensuring fairness and adherence to the time constraint. Thus, the total time needed remains at 45 minutes for the first group.<|im_end|>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the lengths of the two pieces after Ian makes his cuts. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the length of the shorter piece.
   - Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, let’s denote the length of the longer piece as \( 4x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total length of the board is given as 40 feet. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of both pieces must equal 40 feet.
   - We know that the shorter piece is \( x \) and the longer piece is \( 4x \). So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     x + 4x = 40
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
     \[
     5x = 40
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
     \]
   - So, the shorter piece (which is \( x \)) is 8 feet.

4. **Calculate the Longer Piece:**
   - Now that we know \( x = 8 \), we can find the length of the longer piece, which is \( 4x \):
     \[
     4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet}
     \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\text{32}}

Then dividing 40 by 5 gives the value of x which is <<40/5=8>>8.
Since x =8, the longer piece is 4*8 = 32.

To determine how much of the secret seasoning Aiden needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds of ground beef needed:**
   - Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.
   - Each pound of ground beef yields six meatballs (since \( \frac{6}{1} = 6 \)).
   - Therefore, the total weight of ground beef required is \( \frac{80}{6} \) pounds.

2. **Determine the amount of ground beef per pound of meatballs:**
   - From the given information, Aiden uses two tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.

3. **Calculate the total amount of seasoning needed:**
   - First, find out how many pounds of ground beef are used in total.
   - Then, calculate how many tablespoons of seasoning are needed based on the ratio provided.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total weight of ground beef needed:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of a 36-minute call based on the different pricing tiers.

Step 1: Determine if the first tier applies or the second tier applies.
- The first tier applies since the call duration (36 minutes) is more than 16 minutes but less than or equal to 48 minutes.

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the first tier (up to 16 minutes).
- For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
\[ \text{Cost} = 16 \times 0.25 = \$4.00 \]

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the additional time after 16 minutes.
- After 16 minutes, the cost drops to $0.2 per minute.
\[ \text{Additional Cost} = (36 - 16) \times 0.2 = 20 \times 0.2 = \$4.00 \]

Step 4: Add the costs together to get the total cost.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$4.00 + \$4.00 = \$8.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $\boxed{\$8.00}$.<|im_end|>","First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.
After that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.
So in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much rain will fall on Tuesday based on the information given about Monday's rainfall.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Monday's Rainfall:**
   - It rained 2 inches on Monday.
   
2. **Tuesday's Expected Rainfall:**
   - On Tuesday, it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice the amount that fell on Monday.
   
3. **Calculate Twice the Amount from Monday:**
   - Twice the amount of rain on Monday = \(2 \times 2\) inches = 4 inches
   
4. **Add the Extra Inch for Tuesday:**
   - The additional amount of rain on Tuesday = 1 inch
   
5. **Total Rainfall on Tuesday:**
   - Total rain on Tuesday = Twice the amount from Monday + Additional rain = 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches
   
### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is **5 inches**.<|im_end|>","Twice as much rain as Monday is 2 inches * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 inches
It will rain 1 more inch than this value on Tuesday so 4 inches + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 inches on Tuesday

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of treats per person:**
   - Each person receives 2 treats.
   - There are 5 people in the class.

2. **Calculate the total number of treats available:**
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes made.
   - According to the problem, she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. Therefore, if we let \( B \) be the number of brownies, then:
     \[
     B = 3C + 2
     \]

4. **Set up an equation based on the total number of treats:**
   - Since each treat (cupcake or brownie) can only be one type, and there are 10 treats in total, we have:
     \[
     C + B = 10
     \]
   - Substitute \( B \) from the earlier equation into this new equation:
     \[
     C + [3C + 2] = 10
     \]

5. **Solve the equation for \( C \):**
   \[
   C + 3C + 2 = 10 \\
   4C + 2 = 10 \\
   4C = 8 \\
   C = 2
   \]

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - If \( C = 2 \), then \( B = 3(2) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 \).
   - The total number of treats is indeed \( 2 + 8 = 10 \).

Therefore, Carly made 2 cupcakes. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","First, figure out how many total treats Carly made for her class by multiplying the number of people in the class by the number of treats per person: 5 people * 2 treats/person = <<5*2=10>>10 treats
Next, express the number of brownies in terms of the number of cupcakes based on the problem information: b = 3c - 2, where b is the number of brownies and c is the number of cupcakes
We know that b + c = 10, the total number of treats, so now we can substitute in the expression for b from the last step: 3c - 2 + c = 10
Now we combine like terms to get 4c - 2 = 10
We add two to both sides of the equation to get 4c = 12
Finally, we divide both sides by 4 to get c = 3

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Karen would pay for both a manicure and a pedicure including nail art, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the manicure:**
   - The base price of a manicure is $35.
   - There is a 20% discount on both services together.
   
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price of Manicure} = 35 \times (1 - 0.20) = 35 \times 0.80 = \$28
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the pedicure:**
   - The base price of a pedicure is $40.
   - There is a 20% discount on both services together.
   
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price of Pedicure} = 40 \times (1 - 0.20) = 40 \times 0.80 = \$32
   \]

3. **Add the cost of the nail art:**
   - The cost of adding nail art is $3 per nail.
   - Assuming there are 12 nails on each hand, that’s 24 nails total.
   
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Nail Art} = 24 \times 3 = \$72
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined cost before applying any discounts:**
   - Sum up the discounted prices of the manicure and pedicure.

   \[
   \text{Combined Cost Before Discount} = \$28 + \$32 = \$60
   \]

5. **Apply the 20% discount to the combined cost:**

   \[
   \text{Final Total Cost} = 60 \times (1 - 0.20) = 60 \times 0.80 = \$48
   \]

**Conclusion:**

Karen would pay a total of $48 for both services including the nail art. 

\boxed{\$48}<|im_end|>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.

   - The 12-issue magazine sends 12 issues per year.
   - The 6-issue magazine sends 6 issues per year.

2. **Calculate how many times the 12-issue magazine sends compared to the 6-issue magazine:**
   - The 12-issue magazine sends 4 times as much as the 6-issue magazine because \( \frac{12}{6} = 2 \).

3. **Determine the total number of magazines received annually from the 12-issue magazine:**
   - Since there are 3 such magazines, we multiply the number of magazines per year (which is 1) by 3. So, \( 1 \times 3 = 3 \).

4. **Determine the total number of magazines received annually from the 6-issue magazine:**
   - There is only 1 magazine sending 6 issues per year, so \( 1 \times 6 = 6 \).

5. **Add up all the magazines received from both types of magazines:**
   - From the 12-issue magazine: \( 3 \) magazines.
   - From the 6-issue magazine: \( 6 \) magazines.
   - Total: \( 3 + 6 = 9 \).

Therefore, Susan gets a total of 9 magazines every year.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many paintings Kim has based on the information provided about the number of paintings each person has.

Step 1: Determine how many paintings Samantha has.
Samantha has 27 paintings.

Step 2: Determine how many paintings Shelley has.
Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, we can calculate the number of paintings Shelley has as follows:
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Step 3: Determine how many paintings Kim has.
We know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. Therefore, if \( K \) represents the number of paintings Kim has, then:
\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Kim's paintings} + 8 \]
Substituting the value we found for Shelley's paintings:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( K \).
To find out how many paintings Kim has, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has **31** paintings.<|im_end|>","Shelley has 27+12=<<27+12=39>>39 paintings.

1. Calculate the price increase from November to December.
2. Calculate the new price after the increase.
3. Calculate the price decrease from December to January.
4. Calculate the final price after the decrease.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Price Increase from November to December
- The initial price in November is $40.
- The price increases by 80%.

\[
\text{Increase} = \text{Initial Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Increase} = \$40 \times \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) = \$40 \times 0.8 = \$32
\]

So, the price in December will be:

\[
\text{December Price} = \text{November Price} + \text{Increase}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{December Price} = \$40 + \$32 = \$72
\]

### Step 2: New Price After the Decrease in January
- The price in December ($72) decreases by 50% from January onwards.

\[
\text{Decrease} = \text{December Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Decrease}}{100}\right)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Decrease} = \$72 \times \left(\frac{50}{100}\right) = \$72 \times 0.5 = \$36
\]

So, the price in January will be:

\[
\text{January Price} = \text{December Price} - \text{Decrease}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{January Price} = \$72 - \$36 = \$36
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{36}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Charlie's reduced lesson rate
Charlie originally charges $80 per hour. He decides to reduce his rate by 25%. 

- First, calculate 25% of $80.
\[ \text{Reduction} = 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

- Subtract the reduction from the original rate to get the new rate.
\[ \text{New Rate} = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of hours Charlie teaches today
Charlie has scheduled two types of lessons today:
- 4 one-hour lessons at his standard rate.
- 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran.

- Total one-hour lessons = 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate earnings from standard-rate lessons
Each one-hour lesson at the standard rate is worth $80.

- Earnings from standard-rate lessons = 6 hours × $80/hour = $480.

### Step 4: Calculate earnings from veteran lessons
For the veteran lessons, Charlie's reduced rate is $60 per hour.

- Each one-hour lesson with the veteran costs $60.

- Since there are 2 such lessons, the total earnings from these lessons are:
\[ \text{Earnings from veterans} = 2 \times \$60 = \$120 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all earnings
- Standard-rate earnings: $480
- Veteran lessons earnings: $120

- Total earnings for the day = $480 + $120 = $600.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is **$600**.<|im_end|>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.
Reducing the rate by 25% for veterans means he takes $80/4=$<<80/4=20>>20 off his standard fee.
Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

Now we'll count all the scores including the missing one:

Total number of scores = 1 (first unknown score) + 5 (known scores) + 1 (missing score) = 7 scores.

**Step 4: Calculate the mean**
To find the mean, divide the total sum of all scores by the number of scores.

Mean score = \(\frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of scores}}\) 

Substituting the values:

Mean score = \(\frac{590}{7}\)

Calculating the division:

Mean score ≈ \(84.29\)

Therefore, Sally's mean score is approximately **84.29**.<|im_end|>","Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.
Her mean score is 630 / 9/quizzes = <<630/9=70>>70/quiz.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pomelos Eve has initially:**
   - Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.

2. **Calculate what fraction of these pomelos Eve still has after giving some away:**
   - According to the problem, Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pomelos she originally had.
   
3. **Set up an equation to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pomelos given away.
   - Since Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of her original 20 pomelos, we can write the equation:
     \[
     20 - x = \frac{1}{4} \times 20
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     20 - x = 5
     \]
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     x = 15
     \]

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 15. Eve gave away 15 pomelos.<|im_end|>","Eve is left with 20 x 1/4 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 pieces of pomelos.
So she gave away 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 pieces of pomelos to her friend.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

1. **Determine the total number of apples:**
   Walter bought 60 apples.
   
2. **Calculate how many apples Walter ate:**
   Walter ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the apples.
   \[
   \text{Apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the remaining apples after eating some:**
   Subtract the apples eaten from the total number of apples.
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister:**
   Walter gave \(25\%\) of the remaining apples to his sister.
   \[
   \text{Apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]

   Subtract the apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many apples Walter sold to his uncle:**
   Walter sold the remaining apples at $3 each.
   \[
   \text{Money received from selling apples} = 27 \times 3 = \$81

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many novels Regina has written this year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
   - This number represents three-quarters (3/4) of the total number of novels she has written this year.

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   Let \( x \) represent the total number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, 9 novels is equal to 3/4 of \( x \). We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   9 = \frac{3}{4}x
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):
   \[
   9 \times \frac{4}{3} = x
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

So, Regina has written a total of 12 novels this year. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 12.<|im_end|>","Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year

                    question:
                    Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed ; of 50km/hr (taking into account all ! the necessary stops for gas, relaxation, etc.). If he goes : on like this for 3 days, and the . distance ? between Alaska and Texas is ? 6000 km, what percentage of this distance has he ; covered?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of the total distance that Michael has traveled, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael will travel**:
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/h.
   - He travels for 3 days.

2. **Determine the total time spent driving**:
   - Time = Speed × Distance per unit of time
   - Since we need to convert the units to hours, let's assume the number of hours per day as H.
   - Total time = H * Days = H * 3 (since there are 3 days)

3. **Convert kilometers per hour to kilometers per hour**:
   - To find the total distance driven in kilometers, multiply the speed by the total time in hours.

4. **Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered**:
   - Percentage = (Total distance driven / Total distance) × 100%

Let's go through these calculations:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael will travel
- Let's denote the number of hours per day as H.
- The total time spent driving over 3 days would be 3H hours.

### Step 2: Determine the total time spent driving
- Given the average speed is 50 km/h, the total distance Michael will cover can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Total distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \text{Total distance} = 50 \, \text{km/h} \times 3H \, \text{hours} = 150H \, \text{km}
  \]

### Step 3: Convert kilometers per hour to kilometers per hour
- Assuming H is approximately 8 hours (a reasonable estimate for a typical drive), then:
  \[
  \text{Total distance} = 150 \times 8 = 1200 \, \text{km}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered
- The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km.
- The percentage of the total distance covered is:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total distance from Alaska to Texas}} \right) \times 100\%
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1200 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100\% = 20\%
  \]

Thus, Michael has covered \( \boxed{20\%} \) of the distance between Alaska and Texas.<|im_end|>","There are 24 hours in each day, so he has been traveling for a total of 3*24 = <<24*3=72>>72 hours

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine how many grapes Madeline's brother used.
Madeline's brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline did. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used:

\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many grapes were left after Madeline's brother finished using them.
After his use, the number of grapes left would be:

\[ 6 - 30 = -24 \text{ grapes (impossible since he can't have negative grapes)} \]

However, this seems incorrect because it implies that more than enough grapes were eaten before she started making juice. Let’s correct this by assuming she made juice first.

### Step 3: Determine how many grapes Madeline needed for juice.
Her mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, with each pie requiring 12 grapes. So, for 4 pies:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many grapes Madeline had initially.
Since Madeline made juice with the grapes she had, let \( x \) be the initial number of grapes. After making juice, she has \( x - 30 \) grapes left. These remaining grapes were used to make juice, which required 48 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes Madeline had initially was:

\[ x = 48 + 30 = 78 \text{ grapes} \]

So, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of teachers**: The problem states there were ""82 teachers"" on the last Friday.

2. **Determine how many teachers were not present due to sickness**: We know that 9 substitute teachers were called in to help cover for the sick teachers.

3. **Calculate the number of teachers who were present (not sick)**: Subtract the number of substitute teachers from the total number of teachers.
   \[
   82 - 9 = 73
   \]
   So, 73 teachers were not sick and thus present at the school.

4. **Verify the information about the sick teachers**:
   - If we assume all other teachers were sick, then indeed, the 9 substitute teachers would be needed to cover for those who were sick.
   - This matches the given information that 9 substitute teachers were called in.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on our calculations, the number of teachers present at school that day was 73.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost per batch**: Bud makes macaroni once a week. Each batch costs him $1.00 for pasta.

2. **Cost of Cheddar Cheese**:
   - He spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
   - This cost is doubled because he buys the same amount again (twice that amount).
   - Therefore, his total cost for cheddar cheese = $3.00 * 2 = $6.00 per batch.

3. **Cost of Gruyère Cheese**:
   - He spends twice as much on Gruyère cheese as on cheddar cheese.
   - So, for Gruyère cheese, he spends = $6.00 * 2 = $12.00 per batch.

4. **Total Cost per Batch**:
   - Pasta: $1.00
   - Cheddar Cheese: $3.00
   - Gruyère Cheese: $12.00
   - Total cost per batch = $1.00 + $3.00 + $12.00 = $16.00

5. **Number of Batches in a Year**:
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Therefore, the number of batches he makes in a year = 52.

6. **Total Annual Cost**:
   - Total annual cost = Number of batches * Total cost per batch
   - Total annual cost = 52 * $16.00 = $832.00

To solve this problem, let's break down the information and calculate step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine Total Clean-Up Time Needed

First, we need to find out how long it will take to clean all 80 classrooms.

- Each classroom requires 15 minutes.
- There are 80 classrooms.

\[
\text{Total clean-up time} = 80 \times 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating:

\[
80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert Hours into Minutes

Next, convert the total clean-up time from minutes to hours.

\[
1200 \text{ minutes} ÷ 60 \text{ (minutes in one hour)} = 20 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it would take 20 hours to clean all classrooms if working continuously without breaks.

### Step 3: Calculate Daily Working Hours

Given that there are 5 days available for cleaning:

\[
\text{Daily working hours} = 5 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 40 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Average Percentage Spent Cleaning

Now, we need to determine the average percentage of the working day spent cleaning.

\[
\text{Percentage spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Clean-up time}}{\text{Total working hours}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
\]

To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, let's break down the information step-by-step:

1. **Determine the capacity of each type of shelf:**
   - Bottom shelf: Can hold twice as many books as the middle shelf.
     - Middle shelf holds 10 books.
     - Therefore, the bottom shelf holds \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) books.

   - Top shelf: Can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
     - Bottom shelf holds 20 books.
     - Therefore, the top shelf holds \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books that can be held in one set of bookcases:**
   - We have three sets of bookcases (bottom, middle, and top).
   - Each set consists of two middle shelves + one bottom shelf + one top shelf.
   - Total books per set:
     \[
     (2 \times 10) + 1 \times 20 + 1 \times 20 = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of sets needed to hold 110 books:**
   - Number of sets required:
     \[
     \frac{110}{60} = 1.8333 \approx 2 \text{ sets}
     \]
   
4. **Calculate the total number of bookcases needed for 2 sets:**
   - Each set requires 2 bookcases (one for the bottom shelf, one for the middle shelves, and one for the top shelf).
   - Total bookcases:
     \[
     2 \text{ sets} \times 2 \text{ bookcases/set} = 4 \text{ bookcases}
     \]

Therefore, Elly needs 4 bookcases to hold all 110 books.<|im_end|>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rose has**
- Rose bought five dozens of eggs.
- One dozen = 12 eggs.
- Therefore, five dozens = 5 × 12 = 60 eggs.

**Step 2: Determine the cost per egg**
- The price for one dozen (12 eggs) is $2.40.
- Therefore, the cost per egg = $2.40 ÷ 12 = $0.20 per egg.

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all eggs at $1 for 3 eggs**
- Number of sets of 3 eggs in 60 eggs = 60 ÷ 3 = 20 sets.
- Revenue from selling these sets = 20 sets × $1/set = $20.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of buying the eggs**
- Cost per egg = $0.20.
- Total cost for 60 eggs = 60 × $0.20 = $12.

**Step 5: Calculate the profit**
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
- Profit = $20 - $12 = $8.

Therefore, Rose's profit is $8.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{8}$.<|im_end|>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.
Five dozens of eggs is equal to 12 x 5 = <<12*5=60>>60 eggs.
So there are 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 sets of 3 eggs that Rose will sell.
Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of hats:**
   Skyler has 100 hats.

2. **Calculate the number of red hats:**
   - Half of the hats are red.
   - Number of red hats = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50 \).

3. **Calculate the number of non-red (blue and white) hats:**
   - Remaining hats after removing red ones = \( 100 - 50 = 50 \).

4. **Calculate the number of blue hats:**
   - The problem states that three-fifths of the remaining hats are blue.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blue hats.
   - We know that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining 50 hats are blue.
   - So, \( B = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 \).
   - Calculate \( B \):
     \[
     B = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   - Subtract the number of blue and red hats from the total to find the number of white hats.
   - Total hats minus blue hats minus red hats gives us the number of white hats.
   - Number of white hats = \( 100 - B - R \), where \( R \) is the number of red hats.
   - Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( R = 50 \):
     \[
     W = 100 - 30 - 50 = 20
     \]

6. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Red hats: 50
   - Blue hats: 30
   - White hats: 20

After verifying all calculations, we conclude that Skyler has 20 white hats.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","If half of the hats are red, there are 1/2*100= <<1/2*100=50>>50 red hats.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of sticks in one bag**

- The problem states that Archie buys ""30 sticks"" per bag.

**Step 2: Calculate the original price for 1 bag**

- Each bag costs $18.00.

**Step 3: Apply the discount**

- Archie gets $3.00 off per bag.
  
- Therefore, the new price per bag after applying the discount would be:
\[ \text{New Price} = \$18.00 - \$3.00 = \$15.00 \]

**Step 4: Find out how many bags Archie can buy at the discounted price**

- Archie has a budget of $96.00 (since he bought 1 bag).

- To find out how many bags he can afford, divide his total budget by the discounted price per bag:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\$96.00}{\$15.00} \approx 6.4 \]
Since he cannot purchase a fraction of a bag, he can buy up to 6 full bags.

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost for these bags**

- Cost per bag remains $15.00.

- Total cost for 6 bags:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 6 \times \$15.00 = \$90.00 \]

**Step 6: Calculate the cost per stick**

- Since there are 30 sticks per bag and he spends $90.00 on 6 bags, we need to determine the cost per stick.

- First, calculate the total number of sticks:
\[ \text{Total Sticks} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \]

- Then, divide the total cost ($90.00) by the total number of sticks (180):
\[ \text{Cost per Stick} = \frac{\$90.00}{180} \approx \$0.50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky is approximately **$0.50** or 50 cents.<|im_end|>","The bags are $18.00 with a $3.00 coupon so each bag is 18-3 = $<<18-3=15.00>>15.00

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to meet her goal of passing sixth grade, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of correct answers on the first test:**
   - Total questions on the first test = 70
   - Percentage of questions that must be answered correctly = 70%

   \[
   \text{Number of correct answers} = 70 \times 0.70 = 49
   \]

2. **Determine the number of incorrect answers on the first test:**
   - Since there are 70 questions in total and she got 49 correct,
     \[
     \text{Number of incorrect answers} = 70 - 49 = 21
     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of questions she still needs to get right on the second test:**
   - To pass, she must correctly answer at least 70% of all questions.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test.

   \[
   \frac{x}{x + (40)} \geq 0.70
   \]
   
   Simplifying this inequality:
   
   \[
   \frac{x}{x + 40} \geq 0.70
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

   \[
   x \geq 0.70(x + 40)
   \]
   
   Distribute 0.70 on the right side:
   
   \[
   x \geq 0.70x + 28
   \]
   
   Subtract 0.70x from both sides:
   
   \[
   x - 0.70x \geq 28
   \]
   
   Combine like terms:
   
   \[
   0.30x \geq 28
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 0.30:
   
   \[
   x \geq \frac{28}{0.30}

   Calculate the value:
   
   \[
   x \geq 93.\overline{3}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes equals 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:
     \[
     B = 5S - 4
     \]
   - The total number of ice cubes (both strawberry and blueberry) is given as 116. Therefore, we also have:
     \[
     S + B = 116
     \]

3. **Substitute into the Total Equation:**
   - Substitute \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     S + (5S - 4) = 116
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( S \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6S - 4 = 116
     \]
   - Add 4 to both sides:
     \[
     6S = 120
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     S = 20
     \]

5. **Find \( B \) Using the Value of \( S \):**
   - Now that we know \( S = 20 \), substitute back into the expression for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 5S - 4
     \]
     \[
     B = 5(20) - 4
     \]
     \[
     B = 100 - 4
     \]
     \[
     B = 96
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 96.<|im_end|>","Let s be the number of strawberry cubes and b be the number of blueberry cubes. We know that b = 5s - 4 and s + b = 116.

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120
Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20
Substituting this value back into the equation b = 5s - 4, we get b = 96

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many games Ara played over the four years and then multiply that by her average score per game.

Step 1: Determine the total number of games played over the four years.
Ara plays 40 games each year for 4 years. Therefore, the total number of games played is:

\[ \text{Total Games} = \text{Games per Year} \times \text{Number of Years} \]

Substitute the given values into the equation:

\[ \text{Total Games} = 40 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total Games} = 160 \]

So far, we have calculated that Ara has played 160 games over the four years.

Step 2: Calculate the total points scored.
We know that Ara scores an average of 21 points per game. To find out the total points scored, we multiply the total number of games by her average score per game:

\[ \text{Total Points} = \text{Total Games} \times \text{Average Score per Game} \]

Substitute the values we found:

\[ \text{Total Points} = 160 \times 21 \]
\[ \text{Total Points} = 3360 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored over the four years is \( \boxed{3360} \).<|im_end|>","Forty games every year translates to 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 games in four years.

To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we'll break down the information provided and use it to calculate the required number of calls.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of potential customers per call:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets one potential customer.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of potential customers needed:**
   - To sell 15 cars, Jason needs to get 15 potential customers.
   
3. **Set up the equation to find the number of calls needed:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of calls Jason needs to make.
   - Since each call results in 1 potential customer, \( C \) calls should result in \( C \) potential customers.
   
4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - We know from the given data that for every 25 calls, there's 1 potential customer. So, if Jason needs 15 potential customers, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{C}{25} = 15
     \]
   
5. **Simplify and solve for \( C \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 25 to isolate \( C \):
     \[
     C = 15 \times 25
     \]
   - Calculate the product:
     \[
     C = 375
     \]

     8 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ flashlights/room} = 32 \text{ flashlights}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of candles:**
   - There are 4 small candles each for half of the rooms (which is 4 rooms).
   - Therefore, the number of small candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ candles/room} = 8 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - There are 5 medium candles each for the other half of the rooms (which is also 4 rooms).
   - Therefore, the number of medium candles is:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 3 \text{ candles/room} = 12 \text{ medium candles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of candles:**
   - Total number of candles = Number of small candles + Number of medium candles
   - Total number of candles = 8 small candles + 12 medium candles = 20 candles.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family uses when the lights go out is:
\[
\boxed{32 \text{ flashlights}, 20 \text{ candles}}
\]<|im_end|>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.
Total, there are 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 candles in the house.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for John to complete the Rubik's cube based on the given information.

1. **Time to reach the first side**: 
   - John takes 5 minutes.
   
2. **Time to reach the second side**:
   - Since the second side takes twice as long as the first side,
     \[
     \text{Time} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time to reach the third side**:
   - Similarly, the third side also takes twice as long as the first side,
     \[
     \text{Time} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time to reach the fourth side**:
   - The fourth side takes half as long as the first side,
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Time to reach the fifth side**:
   - Finally, the fifth side requires no additional time beyond what has already been calculated since he has completed all other sides before reaching this one,
     \[
     \text{Time} = 2.5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now, let's sum up all these times to find out how long it takes for John to complete the Rubik's cube:

\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it takes John to complete the Rubik's cube is \( \boxed{30 \text{ minutes}} \).<|im_end|>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 20 helmets.

2. **Determine the number of footballs:**
   - We know that there are half as many footballs as helmets.
   - Since there are 20 helmets, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of footballs} = \frac{\text{Number of helmets}}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the given value for helmets:
     \[
     \text{Number of footballs} = \frac{20}{2} = 10

3. **Calculate the number of robots:**
   - According to the problem, Dominick saw half as many robots as he did helmets.
   - Since there are 20 helmets, we can set up the equation:

4. **Summarize all items found:**
   - The number of helmets: 20
   - The number of footballs: 10
   - The number of robots: 10

5. **Add up all the items to find the total number of items:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total time Tim spends on calls in one day:**
   - Time spent per call = 15 minutes
   - Number of calls in one day = 6 hours/day / 15 minutes/call
   - Convert hours to minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 
     \[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]
   - Divide by the number of minutes per call:
     \[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day} \]

2. **Calculate the total number of calls over a 5-day work week:**
   - Total calls in a week = Calls per day * Days in the week
   - Substitute the values we found earlier:
     \[ 24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the time taken per painting with the new varnish:**
   - The new varnish takes 12 minutes for one coat to dry.

2. **Calculate the total time for 6 paintings with the new varnish:**
   - Time for 1 painting = 12 minutes.
   - Number of paintings = 6.
   - Total time for 6 paintings = 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time for 6 paintings with the old varnish:**
   - Let \( T_{old} \) be the time it takes for 1 painting to dry with the old varnish.
   - We know that for 6 paintings, this time is \( 6T_{old} \).
   - Since we don't have a specific value for \( T_{old} \), let’s assume it is known or can be calculated based on previous experience or research (which isn’t provided here).

4. **Calculate the difference in drying times between the two methods:**
   - Difference in time = \( 72 minutes - 6T_{old} \).

Now, let's put these steps together into a clear expression:

- For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one coat to dry.
- For the old varnish, if we assume \( T_{old} \) minutes for one coat to dry, then for 6 paintings it takes \( 6T_{old} \) minutes.
- To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish with the new varnish compared to the old varnish for 6 paintings, we need to calculate the difference in time:

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 6T_{old} \]

Since the value of \( T_{old} \) is not provided, we cannot compute a numerical result without additional information about the drying time with the old varnish. If you provide the exact drying time for the old varnish, I can plug that into the equation to get the precise difference. 

However, if we were to proceed assuming typical values, say \( T_{old} = 8 \) minutes (a common assumption in such problems), then:

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 6 \times 8 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 24 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the difference in time is 24 minutes. This means it will take 24 more minutes for the coat of varnish with the new varnish to dry than with the old varnish for 6 paintings. 

Therefore, the final answer is: It will take **24 minutes** longer for the coat of varnish with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish for 6 paintings.<|im_end|>","Usually, the varnish on all 6 paintings would be dry in 7*6=<<7*6=42>>42 minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much water Crista needs every day for her plants, we'll break down the information given and perform calculations accordingly.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of plants needing different amounts of water.
- **Half cup**: 4 plants
- **1 cup**: 8 plants
- **Quarter cup**: Remaining plants (total plants - those needing half or one cup)

Total plants = 20
Plants needing half cup of water = 4
Plants needing one cup of water = 8

First, calculate the remaining plants that need a quarter of a cup of water:
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 20 - (\text{Plants needing half cup} + \text{Plants needing one cup}) \]
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 20 - (4 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 20 - 12 \]
\[ \text{Remaining plants} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water needed per day.
- **Half cup**: 4 plants * 0.5 cup/plant = \( 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \) cups/day
- **One cup**: 8 plants * 1 cup/plant = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) cups/day
- **Quarter cup**: 8 plants * 0.25 cup/plant = \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \) cups/day

Summing these up gives the total daily water requirement:
\[ \text{Total daily water} = 2 \, \text{(half cup)} + 8 \, \text{(one cup)} + 2 \, \text{(quarter cup)} \]
\[ \text{Total daily water} = 2 + 8 + 2 \]
\[ \text{Total daily water} = 12 \] cups/day

### Conclusion:
Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

To solve this problem, we'll break down Phineas's journey into two parts: one part on land and another part in water.

### Step 1: Determine the total distance Phineas needs to travel.
Phineas needs to cover 200 yards to return home.

### Step 2: Divide the total distance into equal parts for both land and water.
Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, each segment will be:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ yards}}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to travel on land.
Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.
Time on land (in minutes) can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{land}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{land}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{land}}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{land}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards/minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{land}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the time it takes to travel in water.
Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
Time in water (in minutes) can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{water}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{water}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{water}}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{water}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards/minute}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{water}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Add the times together to find the total time.
Total time (in minutes) is the sum of the time spent on land and in water:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{land}} + \text{Time}_{\text{water}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Phineas **15 minutes** to return home.<|im_end|>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how much Bob will need to spend on popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   - Bob wants 56 popsicle sticks.
   - Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks.
   - To find out how many boxes are required, divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of popsicle sticks per box.

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total popsicle sticks}}{\text{Popsicle sticks per box}} = \frac{56}{8}
\]

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = 7
\]

2. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of boxes:**
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   - Multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of boxes}) \times (\text{Cost per box})
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = (7) \times (2)
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 14
\]

3. **Determine the amount Bob will actually spend:**
   - The cost per box ($2.00) does not change regardless of how many boxes are purchased.
   - Therefore, Bob will only pay for the number of boxes he needs, which is 7 boxes at $2.00 per box.

\[
\text{Amount Bob will spend} = 7 \times 2 = \$14
\]

   - Let's denote the cost of one additional phone as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.
   - Therefore, \( 2x = 20 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, each additional phone costs $10.

4. **Calculate the total number of phones:**
   - There are 5 phones in total.

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Cost of the main phone: $20
   - Number of additional phones: 4 (since there are 5 total phones and one is the main)
   - Total cost for the additional phones: \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \)

6. **Sum up the costs:**
   - Main phone cost: $20
   - Additional phone cost: $40
   - Total cost: \( 20 + 40 = 60 \)

Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $\boxed{60}$.<|im_end|>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Derrick makes from selling his doughnuts over the course of June.

Step 1: Determine the number of days in June.
June typically has 30 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
Since Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts per day and there are 12 doughnuts in one dozen, the total number of doughnuts made per day is \(10 \times 12 = 120\) doughnuts.

Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is \(120 \times 30 = 3600\) doughnuts.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.
If each doughnut is sold for $2, then the total revenue is \(3600 \times 2 = \$7200\).

So, Derrick makes \(\boxed{7200}\) dollars in June from selling all the doughnuts.<|im_end|>","A dozen doughnuts have 12 doughnuts, and if Derrick makes 10 dozen in a day, the total number of doughnuts he makes is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 doughnuts.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate total number of photos
Jade has taken a total of 210 photos over the course of the week.

### Step 2: Determine the number of photos uploaded per day
If she uploads 7 photos in one batch and there are 6 batches per day, then the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[ \text{Photos per day} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days required to upload all photos
Since she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
\[ \text{Days required} = \frac{210}{42} = 5 \]

Therefore, Jade will need **5** days to upload all of her photos.<|im_end|>","Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Alicia spends on dry cleaning over 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing item (blouse, pant, and skirt) separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for blouses
- Number of blouses: 5
- Cost per blouse: $5.00
- Total cost for blouses = Number of blouses × Cost per blouse
\[ \text{Total cost for blouses} = 5 \times 5.00 = \$25.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for skirts
- Number of skirts: 1
- Cost per skirt: $6.00
- Total cost for skirts = Number of skirts × Cost per skirt
\[ \text{Total cost for skirts} = 1 \times 6.00 = \$6.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for pants
- Number of pairs of pants: 2
- Cost per pair of pants: $8.00
- Total cost for pants = Number of pairs of pants × Cost per pair of pants
\[ \text{Total cost for pants} = 2 \times 8.00 = \$16.00 \]

### Step 4: Sum the total costs
- Total cost for all items = Cost for blouses + Cost for skirts + Cost for pants
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$25.00 + \$6.00 + \$16.00 = \$47.00 \]

Therefore, Alicia spends a total of $47.00 on dry cleaning over 5 weeks.<|im_end|>","The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00

                    John decides to take up an ; odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine John's new speaking speed after training:**
   - John's original speaking speed (WPM) = 150.
   - After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.
   
   \[
   \text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:**
   - Each page contains 450 words.
   - Number of pages = 10.

   \[
   \text{Total Words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words}
   \]

3. **Convert the total number of words into minutes based on his new speed:**
   - New speed = 375 WPM.
   - Time (in seconds) = Total Words / New Speed.

   \[
   \text{Time (seconds)} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Convert the time from seconds to minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute.

   \[
   \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, it would take John approximately \(0.2\) minutes or \(12\) seconds to read 10 pages at his new speaking speed.<|im_end|>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

So he can speak them in 4500/375=<<4500/375=12>>12 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people at the beach over the three days:**
   - First day: 50 people
   - Second day: 20 more than the first day (which means \(50 + 20 = 70\) people)
   - Third day: Twice the number from the second day (which means \(70 \times 2 = 140\) people)

   Adding these together gives us the total number of people at the beach during the week:
   \[
   50 + 70 + 140 = 260 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Calculate the average number of people per day:**
   - We know that the total number of people seen in the week is 260, and we need to find out how many people Conor saw on average each day.

   Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of people by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{260}{7} \approx 37.14 \text{ people per day}
   \]

So, the final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. **Initial Pop Rate Calculation:**
   - Let \( P_0 \) be the initial popping rate.
   - In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
   - Since these 20 kernels represent one-third of the total number of kernels (because after 30 seconds, it increases to four times the initial rate), we can write:
     \[
     \frac{P_0}{3} = 20
     \]
     Solving for \( P_0 \):
     \[
     P_0 = 60
     \]

2. **Pop Rate Over Time:**
   - In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so the new rate is:
     \[
     P_{\text{new}} = 4 \times P_0 = 4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves back to the original rate:
     \[
     P_{\text{final}} = \frac{P_0}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

3. **Final Number of Populations:**
   - We need to determine how many pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat.
   - Given that the final popping rate is 30 kernels per 30 seconds, we calculate the total number of kernels popped over time.
   
   **First 30 seconds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of kernels} = 20
   \]

   **Next 30 seconds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of kernels} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

   **Final 30 seconds:**
   \[
   \text{Number of kernels} = 4 \times 60 = 240
   \]

   **Residual Heat:**
   \[
   \text{Number of kernels} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]

4. **Total Populations:**
   \[
   \text{Total Populations} = 20 + 60 + 240 + 60 = 380
   \]

**Therefore, the final answer is:** 
\[
\boxed{380}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade:**
   - From the given information, we know that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, for 4 gallons of lemonade (which requires 4 cups of juice), Tim needs:
     \[
     \text{Number of lemons} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{6 \text{ cups per 6 lemons}} = \frac{4}{6} \times 6 = 4 \text{ lemons}
     \]

2. **Determine how much lemon juice is needed for the extra gallon for Allen:**
   - Since the extra gallon should be twice as tart as the others, Tim needs more lemon juice in the extra gallon.
   - If 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, then for 3 cups of juice, Tim would need:
     \[
     \text{Number of lemons} = \frac{3 \text{ cups}}{6 \text{ cups per 6 lemons}} = \frac{3}{6} \times 6 = 3 \text{ lemons}
     \]
   - For 6 lemons, Tim makes 1 cup of juice. To double that, he would need:
     \[
     \text{Extra lemon juice needed} = \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{6 \text{ cups per 6 lemons}} = \frac{1}{6} \times 6 = 1 \text{ cup}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons needed:**
   - For the regular 4-gallon batch, Tim needs 4 lemons.
   - For the extra gallon for Allen, Tim needs 3 lemons plus the additional 1 cup of lemon juice from those 3 lemons.

Let's summarize these calculations:

- Regular batch (4 gallons):
  \[
  \text{Leaves} = 4 \text{ lemons}
  \]

- Extra gallon for Allen (twice as tart):
  \[
  \text{Regular lemons} + \text{Additional lemon juice} = 3 \text{ lemons} + 1 \text{ cup of lemon juice from 3 lemons} = 4 \text{ lemons}
  \]

So, in summary:
\[
\boxed{7 \text{ lemons}}

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the daily consumption for all dogs.
2. Multiply that total by 7 to get the weekly consumption.

Step 1: Daily consumption calculation

- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kg/day.

Total daily consumption for German Shepherds = 3 * 5 kg/day = 15 kg/day

- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kg/day.

Total daily consumption for Bulldogs = 2 * 3 kg/day = 6 kg/day

Total daily consumption for all dogs = (German Shepherds' consumption + Bulldogs' consumption)
= 15 kg/day + 6 kg/day = 21 kg/day

Step 2: Weekly consumption calculation

Total weekly consumption = Total daily consumption * Number of days in a week
= 21 kg/day * 7 days/week = 147 kg/week

Therefore, the kennel house will need **147 kilograms** of dog food in a week.<|im_end|>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of blocks:**
   The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32.

2. **Determine the number of blue blocks:**
   We know that there are 4 blue blocks.

3. **Express the relationship between yellow and blue blocks:**
   It is stated that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
   
   - Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks  
     Therefore, Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8.

4. **Calculate the number of red blocks:**
   The total number of blocks (32) is the sum of all three types of blocks (blue, yellow, and red).
   
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = \text{Blue blocks} + \text{Yellow blocks} + \text{Red blocks}
   \]
   
   Substituting the known values:
   
   \[
   32 = 4 + 8 + \text{Red blocks}
   \]

5. **Solve for the number of red blocks:**
   Subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks.
   
   \[
   \text{Red blocks} = 32 - (4 + 8)
   \]
   
   Simplifying the equation:
   
   \[
   \text{Red blocks} = 32 - 12 = 20

<|im_start|>system
To determine how far Elvis is from his starting point after traveling in two directions, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each direction separately and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled west:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Speed (average speed) = 18 mph
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Distance West = \(18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours}\)

2. **Calculate the distance traveled east:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Speed (average speed) = 18 mph
   - Time = 8 hours
   - Distance East = \(18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours}\)

3. **Sum the distances to find the total distance from home:**

Let's perform these calculations:

1. **Distance West:**
\[ 
\text{Distance West} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
\]

2. **Distance East:**
\[ 
\text{Distance East} = 18 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 144 \text{ miles}
\]

3. **Total Distance from Home:**
\[ 
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance West} + \text{Distance East} = 90 \text{ miles} + 144 \text{ miles} = 234 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer:
Elvis is 234 miles away from his starting point. Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each depreciation period. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Initial Value
Gary initially bought the boat for $9,000.

### Step 2: First Year Depreciation (30%)
The boat depreciates by 30%, so we need to find 70% of its original value.
\[ \text{Value after first year} = \$9,000 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$9,000 \times 0.70 = \$6,300 \]

### Step 3: Second Year Depreciation (another 30%)
Now, the boat has depreciated again, but this time by 30% from its value at the end of the first year.
\[ \text{Value after second year} = \$6,300 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$6,300 \times 0.70 = \$4,410 \]

### Step 4: Third Year Depreciation (20%)
Finally, the boat depreciates by 20% from its value at the end of the second year.
\[ \text{Value after third year} = \$4,410 \times (1 - 0.20) = \$4,410 \times 0.80 = \$3,528 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the boat is worth $3,528 after the three years.<|im_end|>","After first year:9000(.30)=2700

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, let's break down the information provided:

1. The total number of candies is 232.
2. There are 54! red candies (note: factorial notation for large numbers is not practical here).
3. There are twice as many orange candies as red candies.
4. There are half as many yellow candies as red candies.

Let's calculate the number of orange candies first since it is straightforward to compute without needing factorial notation:

- Orange candies = 2 × Red candies = 2 × 54! 

Now we can express the orange candies' calculation mathematically using the given quantity:

\[ \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times 54! \]

Since the total number of candies is 232, the remaining candies must be pink. Let's denote the number of pink candies as \(P\). Therefore,

\[ P + \text{Red candies} + \text{Orange candies} + \text{Yellow candies} = 232 \]

Given that there are twice as many orange candies as red candies:

\[ \text{Orange candies} = 2 \times \text{Red candies} \]
\[ \text{Red candies} = \frac{\text{Orange candies}}{2} \]

Substituting the values into our equation for total candies:

\[ P + \left(\frac{\text{Orange candies}}{2}\right) + \text{Orange candies} + \frac{\text{Orange candies}}{2} = 232 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ P + \frac{\text{Orange candies}}{2} + \text{Orange candies} + \frac{\text{Orange candies}}{2} = 232 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ P + \frac{3 \times \text{Orange candies}}{2} = 232 \]

Factor out common term:

\[ P + \frac{3}{2} \times \text{Orange candies} = 232 \]

We know from above that \(\text{Orange candies} = 2 \times 54!\), so substitute this value back in:

\[ P + \frac{3}{2} \times 2 \times 54! = 232 \]

Simplify further:

\[ P + 3 \times 54! = 232 \]

Finally, solve for \(P\):

\[ P = 232 - 3 \times 54! \]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is:

\[ P = 232 - 3 \times 54! \]

This result indicates that the number of pink candies depends on the factorial value of 54!, which is an extremely large number. Given that the problem asks for the number of pink candies, and considering the constraints and practicality of dealing with such large numbers, it is clear that no exact numerical solution exists without approximation or simplification techniques beyond basic arithmetic operations. Thus, the most precise way to represent the number of pink candies would be:

\[ P = 232 - 3 \times 54! \]<|im_end|>","There are 54 red candies and twice that amount of orange candies for a total of 54*2 = <<54*2=108>>108 candies

                    Helen ? went on : a trip , through Germany. ! She booked a hotel for 3 nights and rode ; the bus 7 times , during that trip. One night : at ! the hotel ! was a cost of $80, and every bus trip was 10% , of the price of one night at the ! hotel. How ? much did Helen pay for the hotel and bus travels during that trip?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Helen incurred during her trip to Germany.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per bus trip
First, let's determine the cost of one bus trip. We know that each bus trip costs 10% of the nightly accommodation fee.

Given:
- The nightly accommodation fee is $80.
- Each bus trip costs 10% of the nightly accommodation fee.

Let \( C \) be the cost of one bus trip.

\[ C = 0.10 \times 80 \]

Calculate:

\[ C = 8 \]

So, each bus trip costs $8.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of bus trips
Helen rode the bus 7 times, so we multiply the cost of one bus trip by 7.

\[ Total\ Cost\ of\ Bus\ Trips = 7 \times C \]

Substitute \( C \):

\[ Total\ Cost\ of\ Bus\ Trips = 7 \times 8 \]

Calculate:

\[ Total\ Cost\ of\ Bus\ Trips = 56 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hotel stay
Next, we add up the cost of all 3 nights at the hotel.

Given:
- The nightly accommodation fee is $80.

Since Helen stayed for 3 nights, we can write:

\[ Total\ Cost\ of\ Hotel\ Stay = 3 \times 80 \]

Calculate:

\[ Total\ Cost\ of\ Hotel\ Stay = 240 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount paid
Finally, we sum the total cost of the hotel stay and the total cost of the bus trips to get the overall expense.

\[ Total\ Amount\ Paid = Total\ Cost\ of\ Hotel\ Stay + Total\ Cost\ of\ Bus\ Trips \]

Substitute the values calculated in Steps 3 and 4:

\[ Total\ Amount\ Paid = 240 + 56 \]

Calculate:

\[ Total\ Amount\ Paid = 296 \]

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travel during her trip is $\boxed{296}$.<|im_end|>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so she paid 7 * 8 = $<<7*8=56>>56 for that.
In total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = $<<240+56=296>>296 in total.

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of marbles given to Dallas
- We know that Dallas ends up with 21 marbles.
- He drops 4 marbles into the playground.

So, let's calculate how many marbles he had initially before dropping any into the playground:
\[ \text{Initial marbles for Dallas} = 21 + 4 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the initial number of marbles given to Dallas
Now, we can find out how many marbles were given to Dallas from the total marbles Mazie originally had (which was 52).

\[ \text{Marbles given to Dallas} = 52 - \text{Initial marbles for Dallas} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of marbles given to Darla
Since the same amount of marbles was given to both Dallas and Darla, we'll determine how many marbles were given to Darla using the same calculation as above.

### Calculation:
First, let’s find out how many marbles Dallas had initially:

\[ \text{Initial marbles for Dallas} = 21 + 4 = 25 \]

Next, let's find out how many marbles were given to Dallas:

\[ \text{Marbles given to Dallas} = 52 - 25 = 27 \]

Since the same amount was given to Darla:

\[ \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 27 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of adults and children
- There are 4 people in total (parents + child).
- We need to find out how many adults and children there are.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the number of adults.
- \( C \) as the number of children.

From the information given:
\[ A + C = 4 \]

We don't have enough information to determine the exact numbers of adults and children directly. However, we can express one variable in terms of the other using this equation.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost based on the number of tickets purchased
- Adults' tickets cost $12 each.
- Children's tickets cost $8 each.

Let's assume they bought:
- \( x \) popcorns at $3 each.

Since we know the total amount spent on popcorn:
\[ 3x \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = (\text{Cost per adult ticket} \times \text{Number of adults}) + (\text{Cost per child ticket} \times \text{Number of children}) + \text{Total cost for popcorn} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = (12A + 8C + 3x) \]

### Step 3: Substitute possible values for \( A \) and \( C \)
Given that we only have one unknown (the number of popcorns), we cannot determine the exact number of adults or children without additional information. 

However, if we assume some reasonable values for simplicity:
- Let's say they bought 2 popcorns. So, \( x = 2 \).

Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = (12A + 8C + 3 \cdot 2) \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12A + 8C + 6 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the expression
Without knowing the exact numbers of adults and children, we can't simplify further. But we can see that the total cost depends on the number of adults and children.

### Final Answer
If we had more specific information about the number of adults and children, we could substitute those values into the equation to get a numerical answer. Without such information, we can't provide a concrete total amount. Therefore, the final answer would be expressed as:
\[
\boxed{\text{Total Cost depends on the number of adults and children}}

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the car (including its contents).
2. Determine the force required to move the car based on the given percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car

- Car weight: 1200 pounds
- Luggage weight: 250 pounds
- Children's weight: 2 * 75 = 150 pounds

Total weight of the car = Car weight + Luggage weight + Children's weight
= 1200 + 250 + 150
= 1600 pounds

### Step 2: Calculate the force needed to move the car

The force required is 1% of the total weight of the car.
Force = Total weight × Percentage

Let's calculate the force:

Force = 1600 × 0.01
= 16 pounds

Therefore, John needs a force of **16 pounds** to push the car.<|im_end|>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds

Given:
- Length (longer side) = 20 feet
- Width (shorter side) = 15 feet

Let's substitute these values into the formula:

                    question:
                    ! Mia and Emma are currently 16 years ; apart ; in ? age. If . Mia, ? who is younger than : Emma, is 40 years old, what's the , average of their ages?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine Mia's current age given that she is 40 years older than Emma, and they are currently 16 years apart.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Emma's Age**:
   - We know that Mia is 40 years older than Emma.
   - Let \( E \) represent Emma's age.
   - Since Mia is 40 years older than Emma, Mia’s age can be represented as \( M = E + 40 \).

2. **Use the Given Distance Between Their Ages**:
   - They are currently 16 years apart in age.
   - Therefore, \( |M - E| = 16 \).

3. **Set Up Equations**:
   - From the above information, we have two equations:
     \[
     M = E + 40
     \]
     \[
     |M - E| = 16
     \]

4. **Solve for Emma's Age (E)**:
   - Substitute \( M = E + 40 \) into the absolute value equation:
     \[
     |(E + 40) - E| = 16
     \]
     Simplify inside the absolute value:
     \[
     |40| = 16
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     40 = 16
     \]
   - Clearly, there seems to be an inconsistency here because it should equal 16 but instead equals 40. This indicates a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the initial setup. 

5. **Re-evaluate the Problem**:
   - Reconsider the relationship between their ages: if Mia is 40 years older than Emma, then Emma must be younger than Mia.
   - The correct interpretation is that if Emma is \( x \) years old, then Mia would be \( x + 40 \) years old.
   - Given they are 16 years apart, we have:
     \[
     |x - (x + 40)| = 16
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     |-40| = 16
     \]
     This confirms that Emma is indeed younger than Mia, and her age is \( x \), so \( x = 40 \).

6. **Calculate Mia's Current Age**:
   - Since Mia is 40 years older than Emma, and Emma is 40 years old, Mia's age is:
     \[
     M = 40 + 40 = 80
     \]

7. **Find the Average of Their Ages**:
   - The total number of people is 2.
   - The sum of their ages is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \).
   - The average age is:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{120}{2} = 60
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.
The sum of their ages is 56+40 = <<56+40=96>>96 years

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Summarize the total number of seashells found:**
   - Tom found 214 seashells.
   - Nancy found \( x \) seashells (where \( x \) is unknown).
   - Benny found 86 seashells.

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells before accounting for cracks:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 214 + x + 86
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total:**
   According to the information given, there are 67 cracked seashells.

4. **Formulate an equation to represent the remaining number of seashells after removing the cracked ones:**

   Let's denote the number of good seashells as \( G \).

   We have:
   \[
   G = (214 + x + 86) - 67
   \]

5. **Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:**
   \[
   214 + 86 = 300
   \]
   So,
   \[
   G = 300 + x - 67
   \]

6. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   G = 300 - 67 + x
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   G = 233 + x
   \]

7. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   Since \( x \) represents the number of seashells Nancy found, it must be a positive integer. However, without additional information about how many seashells Nancy actually found, we cannot determine \( x \) exactly. 

8. **Assuming the problem intends for us to express the result in terms of \( x \):**
   The number of good seashells they find together is:
   \[
   G = 233 + x
   \]

Since the problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \( x \), the final answer expressed in terms of \( x \) is:
\[
G = 233 + x

                    Avery needs to buy ; a 3 piece place setting : (dinner : & salad plate and ! a bowl) for ! her , holiday dinner.  She’s . having 12 people over for dinner.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the place settings Avery will purchase. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one set of place settings
A place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl.

- **Dinner Plate**: Cost = $6.00
- **Salad Plate**: Cost = $4.00
- **Bowl**: Cost = $5.00

Total cost for one set of place settings = Dinner Plate + Salad Plate + Bowl
= $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00
= $15.00

### Step 2: Determine the number of sets needed
Avery has 12 people coming over for dinner. Since she wants enough place settings for everyone, she will need:

\[ \text{Number of Sets} = \frac{\text{Number of People}}{\text{Place Settings per Set}} \]

Since the number of place settings required must be an integer, and since there is no mention of fractional places settings, let's assume that each person gets their own place setting. Therefore, the number of place settings required is equal to the number of people.

- Number of Place Settings Required = 12

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
Now, multiply the cost of one set by the number of sets needed:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost per Set} \times \text{Number of Sets} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$15.00 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$180.00 \]

### Final Answer:
Avery will spend a total of \( \boxed{180.00} \) dollars on place settings.<|im_end|>","Each place setting will need a dinner plate that’s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that’s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00
She needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it took Anna to complete the puzzle based on the information provided about Steve.

Step 1: Determine how long it took Steve.
Steve completed the puzzle in 10 hours.

Step 2: Calculate half of Steve's time.
Half of Steve's time is calculated as follows:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Step 3: Add 2 hours to half of Steve's time.
Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, we add 2 hours to 5 hours:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle.

Final Answer: It took Anna **7** hours to finish the puzzle.<|im_end|>","Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. First, let's calculate the daily feed consumption for all five pigs.

   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed.
   - There are 5 pigs.

   Daily consumption = 4 pounds/pig * 5 pigs = 20 pounds per day.

2. Now, we need to find out how much feed they consume in a week (7 days).

   Weekly consumption = Daily consumption * Number of days in a week
                      = 20 pounds/day * 7 days
                      = 140 pounds.

3. We know that Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed initially.

4. To find out how much feed is left after a week, we subtract the weekly consumption from the initial amount.

   Feed left = Initial amount - Weekly consumption
             = 300 pounds - 140 pounds
             = 160 pounds.

Therefore, after a week, there will be 160 pounds of feed left. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 160 pounds.<|im_end|>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.

So, there are 300 - 280 = <<300-280=20>>20 pounds of feed left.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many hot dogs John needs in total for his upcoming party, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of guests:**
   John invites 20 people.

2. **Determine the number of hot dogs needed per guest:**
   Each guest eats 2 hot dogs.

3. **Calculate the total number of hot dogs required:**
   \[
   \text{Total hot dogs} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Hot dogs per guest}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total hot dogs} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

Next, we need to consider what John already has leftover from another party:

4. **Check if there are enough hot dogs available:**
   John already has 4 leftover hot dogs.
   
5. **Calculate how many more hot dogs are needed:**
   \[
   \text{Additional hot dogs needed} = \text{Total hot dogs required} - \text{Hot dogs already have}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Additional hot dogs needed} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

Now, let's calculate how many packs of hot dogs John needs to buy:

6. **Determine how many packs are needed:**
   Each pack contains 6 hot dogs.
   \[
   \text{Packs needed} = \frac{\text{Additional hot dogs needed}}{\text{Hot dogs per pack}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Packs needed} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]

Finally, we calculate the cost based on the price of one pack:

7. **Calculate the total cost:**
   Each pack costs $2.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Packs needed} \times \text{Cost per pack}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 2 = \$12

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes.
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes.
- Each cupcake costs $2.

\[
\text{Revenue from cupcakes} = 20 \times \$2 = \$40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling cookies.
- Frances sells 40 cookies.
- Each cookie costs $1.

\[
\text{Revenue from cookies} = 40 \times \$1 = \$40
\]

### Step 3: Add the revenues from cupcakes and cookies to get the total revenue.
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \$40 (\text{from cupcakes}) + \$40 (\text{from cookies}) = \$80
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of buying trays.
- Frances buys 5 trays.
- Each tray costs $4.

\[
\text{Cost of trays} = 5 \times \$4 = \$20
\]

### Step 5: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find out how much money Frances has left.
\[
\text{Money left} = \$80 (\text{total revenue}) - \$20 (\text{cost of trays}) = \$60
\]

Therefore, after spending on trays, Frances has $60 left. 

{The final answer is $60}<|im_end|>","20 cupcakes cost 20 x $2 =$<<20*2=40>>40.
40 cookies cost 40 x $1 = $<<40*1=40>>40.

The cost of five trays is 5 x $4 = $<<5*4=20>>20.
Therefore, France will have $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 left.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Meals to Distribute:**
   Mamou has planned to distribute a total of 1,360 meals.

2. **Meals Distributed Each Day:**
   - On Friday, she gave away 64 meals.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the value of each type of coin:**
   - A quarter (25 cents)
   - A nickel (5 cents)
   - A dime (10 cents)

2. **Calculate the total value of quarters:**
   - James has one quarter.
   - Value = 1 * 25 cents = 25 cents.

3. **Calculate the total value of nickels:**
   - James has two nickels.
   - Value = 2 * 5 cents = 10 cents.

4. **Calculate the total value of dimes:**
   - James has seven dimes.
   - Value = 7 * 10 cents = 70 cents.

5. **Sum up all the values to find the total amount of money James has:**
   - Total value = Value of quarters + Value of nickels + Value of dimes
   - Total value = 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents
   - Total value = 105 cents

6. **Convert the total amount into dollars if needed:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar,
   - Total amount in dollars = 105 cents ÷ 100 = $1.05.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} $1.05.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the number of siblings:**
   - There are 2 brothers.
   - There are 3 sisters.

   Total number of siblings = 2 (brothers) + 3 (sisters) = 5.

2. **Determine the ages:**
   - We know that one of the brothers is 12 years old.
   - This brother is also half the age of the older brother.

   Let's denote the older brother as \( B \). Then we have:
   \[
   B = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

   Since the older brother is twice as old as the other brother:
   \[
   2B = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]
   This confirms our previous calculation.

3. **Calculate the sum of all sibling ages:**
   - The three sisters are the same age, and their combined age must equal the remaining age of the older brother.
   - Let’s denote the age of each sister as \( S \).

   From the information given:
   \[
   3S = 24 \text{ years}
   \]
   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

   Therefore, each sister is 8 years old.

4. **Sum up the ages of all siblings:**
   - Two brothers at 12 years each:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Three sisters at 8 years each:
     \[
     3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]

   Total age of all siblings:
   \[
   24 \text{ years (two brothers)} + 24 \text{ years (three sisters)} = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings is 48 years.<|im_end|>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the total amount of time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga over four weeks, we need to break down her schedule into smaller steps.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate daily meditation duration:**
   - Charisma meditates for 15 minutes every day.
   
2. **Calculate weekly meditation duration:**
   - She does this 5 times a week (once in the morning and once at night).
   \[
   \text{Weekly Meditation Time} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 75 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

3. **Convert weekly meditation time to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Weekly Meditation Time (in hours)} = \frac{75}{60} = 1.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate total time spent on meditation over four weeks:**
   - She practices yoga for one hour per day.
   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Yoga Time (in hours)} = 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 7 \text{ hours/week}
   \]
   - Over four weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Meditation Time (in hours) over four weeks} = 1.25 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Add the total meditation time to the total yoga time:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time Spent on Meditation and Yoga over four weeks} = 5 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Conclusion:
Charisma has spent a total of \(12\) hours on both meditation and yoga over four weeks. 

\[
\boxed{12 \text{ hours}}

To determine the total number of square feet in the quilt, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each shirt size.
- **Small T-Shirt**: Each small T-shirt has an area of 3 square feet. Since there are 11 small T-shirts, the total area for the small T-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

- **Medium T-Shirt**: Each medium T-shirt has an area of 4 square feet. Since there are 8 medium T-shirts, the total area for the medium T-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

- **Large T-Shirt**: Each large T-shirt has an area of 6 square feet. Since there are 6 large T-shirts, the total area for the large T-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

### Step 2: Sum up all the areas.
\[
33 + 32 + 36 = 101
\]

Therefore, the total area of the quilt is \(101\) square feet. 

### Final Answer:

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seeds are in both the small and large sunflowers, then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:**
   - The small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, three dozen equals \(3 \times 12 = 36\) seeds.

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - The large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower.
   - To find 50% of the small sunflower's seeds (36), we calculate \(36 \times 0.5 = 18\).
   - Adding this to the original number of seeds gives us \(36 + 18 = 54\) seeds for the large sunflower.

3. **Sum the seeds from both sunflowers:**
   - Small sunflower: 36 seeds
   - Large sunflower: 54 seeds
   - Total seeds: \(36 + 54 = 90\)

Therefore, the total number of seeds in both sunflowers is 90. 

{The final answer is} 90.<|im_end|>","The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.

- George has 18 pens.

Timothy has three times as many pens as George.
\[ \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times (\text{Number of pens George has}) \]

Substitute the given value for George's pens:

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Anne's height:**
   - We know that Anne is twice as tall as Albert.
   - Albert's height = 36 inches.
   - Therefore, Anne's height = 2 * 36 inches.

\[
\text{Anne's height} = 72 \text{ inches}
\]

2. **Calculate Jackie's current height difference from Anne:**
   - Jackie's current height = 3 inches taller than Anne.
   - So, if we subtract 3 inches from Anne's height to find out how much taller she is now compared to Jackie,
   
\[
\text{Jackie's current height} = 72 - 3 = 69 \text{ inches}
\]

3. **Determine how many months Jackie stayed in her current height:**
   - Let's assume Jackie remained at 69 inches for some number of months after summer ended.
   - For simplicity, let's say she stayed for 6 months (as mentioned in the problem).

4. **Calculate how much Jackie grew during those months:**
   - Since Jackie grew 3 inches over these 6 months,
   
\[
\text{Growth per month} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \text{ inches/month}
\]

5. **Find out how much Jackie grew in one month:**
   - The growth rate remains consistent regardless of the time period.

6. **Determine how much Jackie grew in total:**
   - As calculated above, Jackie grew 3 inches over 6 months.

7. **Subtract Jackie's current height from her original height before summer:**
   - To find out how tall Jackie was before summer, we need to reverse her growth process.
   - If Jackie grew 3 inches over 6 months, then to determine her original height before summer, we would subtract this amount from her current height.

\[
\text{Original height before summer} = 69 \text{ inches} - 3 \text{ inches}
\]

8. **Final Calculation:**

\[
\text{Original height before summer} = 66 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, Jackie was originally 66 inches tall before entering summer. 

**The final answer is:** Jackie was originally 66 inches tall before entering summer.<|im_end|>","Anne is twice the size of Albert, who is 36"", so Anne is 2*36 = <<72=72>>72"" tall

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate daily sales revenue:**
   - The company produces 5000 bars per day.
   - Each bar is sold for $2.
   - Daily sales revenue = number of bars * price per bar
     \[
     \text{Daily Sales Revenue} = 5000 \times \$2 = \$10,000
     \]

2. **Calculate weekly sales revenue:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly sales revenue = daily sales revenue * number of days in a week
     \[
     \text{Weekly Sales Revenue} = \$10,000 \times 7 = \$70,000

3. **Calculate total sales over two weeks:**
   - Two weeks have 14 days.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
- Each T-shirt has an original price of $8.

First, calculate the total original price for the T-shirts:
\[ \text{Total Original Price for T-Shirts} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16 \]

Next, apply the ""buy one get one half off"" deal to the T-shirts:

- For the first T-shirt, he pays full price ($8).
- For the second T-shirt, he gets the second one at half price (which is $4).

Now, calculate the total amount spent on the T-shirts:
\[ \text{Amount Paid for T-Shirts} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- There is a 40% discount on the shoes.

Calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 40\% \times \$40 = 0.40 \times \$40 = \$16 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price of the shoes:
\[ \text{Final Price for Shoes} = \$40 - \$16 = \$24 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent
Add up all the amounts spent:
\[ \text{Total Amount Spent} = \$12 (\text{T-Shirts}) + \$24 (\text{Shoes}) \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Spent} = \$36 \]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is \(\boxed{\$36}\).<|im_end|>","The cost of a T-shirt after 50% is taken off of the original price is $8 * 0.50 = $<<8*0.50=4>>4

So, his total allowance = $6/week × 3 weeks = $18.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on ice cream**
Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, and Ryan buys one for himself and three friends (total 4 people).
So, the total cost of ice creams = $1.25/cone × 4 cones = $5.

**Step 3: Subtract the ice cream expense from his allowance**
After buying ice cream, we need to subtract that amount from his total allowance.
His remaining money after buying ice cream = $18 - $5 = $13.

**Step 4: Calculate how much money Ryan has left after buying movie tickets**
Now, Ryan wants to go to the movies. Each ticket costs $6.50.
We need to find out how many movie tickets he can afford with his remaining money ($13).

Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy = Remaining money / Cost per ticket
= $13 ÷ $6.50 ≈ 2 (since he cannot buy a fraction of a ticket)

**Step 5: Determine the final answer**
Ryan can buy approximately 2 movie tickets with his remaining money.

Therefore, the final answer is: **The final answer is:** Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.<|im_end|>","Ryan earned $6 x 3 weeks of chores = $<<6*3=18>>18.
He bought 1 for himself + 3 for his friends = <<1+3=4>>4 ice creams.
The ice cream cost $1.25 x 4 = $<<1.25*4=5>>5.
Ryan has $18 - $5 = $<<18-5=13>>13 left.
With the money he has left, Ryan can buy $13 / $6.50 = <<13/6.50=2>>2 movie tickets.

<|im_start|>waitress
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Ellen and Lani purchased together.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Ellen's purchases.
- Ellen bought leggings for $100.
- Ellen also bought a photo frame for $5.
So, Ellen's total cost = $100 + $5 = $105.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of Lani's purchases.
- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- Lani bought two bathrobes, each costing $100.
Lani's total cost = $30 (sunglasses) + ($100 * 2) = $30 + $200 = $230.

Step 3: Add Ellen's and Lani's totals to find the combined total.
Ellen's total cost + Lani's total cost = $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, Ellen and Lani spent a total of $335 on their gifts for their mom.

The final answer is: The final answer is $335.<|im_end|>","Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $<<100+5=105>>105.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To calculate the total profit from selling 10 jars of the special honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.
- **Passion Fruit**: 
  - Cost per pound = $6  
  - Quantity needed = 2 pounds  
  - Total cost for passion fruit = \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12 \)

- **Jackfruit**:
  - Cost per pound = $8  
  - Quantity needed = 1.5 pounds  
  - Total cost for jackfruit = \( 1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12 \)

- **Honey**:
  - Cost per pound = $10  
  - Quantity needed = 2 pounds  
  - Total cost for honey = \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20 \)

### Step 2: Sum up all ingredient costs.
Total cost for one jar = \( \$12 (\text{passion fruit}) + \$12 (\text{jackfruit}) + \$20 (\text{honey}) \)
\[
= \$44
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.
Total cost for 10 jars = \( 10 \times \$44 \)  
\[
= \$440
\]

### Step 4: Determine the revenue from selling 10 jars.
Each jar is sold for $50.  
Revenue from selling 10 jars = \( 10 \times \$50 \)  
\[
= \$500
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Revenue - Total cost  
\[
\$500 - \$440 = \$60
\]

### Final Answer:
He makes a profit of \(\boxed{\$60}\).<|im_end|>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12

So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60

To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to convert all the coin values into dollars and then sum them up.

Let's break down the calculations:

1. **Quarters**: There are 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   \[
   32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Dimes**: There are 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   \[
   95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Nickels**: There are 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   \[
   120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Pennies**: There are 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   \[
   750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add these amounts together to get the total value of the coins in the jar:
\[
8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 29.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is \( \boxed{29.50} \).<|im_end|>","There are 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dollars in quarters.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janet spent at the mall and then subtract that from the money her parents gave her.

1. Calculate the cost of the ice cream: 
   - Janet spends $3.50 on ice cream.
   
2. Calculate the cost of the movie tickets:
   - She buys two movie tickets, one for herself and one for her younger sister.
   - Each ticket costs $7.50.
   - Total for the tickets = 2 * $7.50 = $15.00
   
3. Add the cost of the bracelet:
   - The bracelet costs $8.50.
   
4. Sum up all the expenses:
   - Ice cream + Movie tickets + Bracelet
   - $3.50 (ice cream) + $15.00 (movie tickets) + $8.50 (bracelet)
   - Total expense = $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00
   
5. Subtract the total expense from what her parents gave her:
   - Parents' gift = $40.00
   - Remaining amount = $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00
   
Therefore, after spending on ice cream, movie tickets, and the bracelet, Janet has $13.00 left.

2. Determine the total number of cars serviced in one week.
3. Compute the weekly earnings based on his hourly rate.
4. Multiply the weekly earnings by 2 to get the amount for 2 weeks.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Number of Days Josh Works in One Week
Josh works from Monday to Friday (Monday through Friday inclusive), which means he works 5 days per week.

### Step 2: Total Number of Cars Serviced in One Week
Josh serves 3 cars per day. So, if he works 5 days in a week, he will service:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

### Step 3: Weekly Earnings Calculation
Josh earns $4 per car. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times \$4/\text{car} = \$60/\text{week} \]

### Step 4: Amount for 2 Weeks
To find out how much he makes in 2 weeks, multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

To determine how many cookies Randy has after all these actions, we will follow each step carefully.

1. **Initial Counting:**
   - Total number of oatmeal cookies = 9
   - Total number of chocolate chip cookies = 4
   - Total number of sugar cookies = 5

2. **Eating Cookies for Snack:**
   - Randy eats 3 cookies in total.
   - Since he eats one cookie from each type (oatmeal, chocolate chip, and sugar), he eats 1 of each type.
   - Remaining oatmeal cookies = 9 - 1 = 8
   - Remaining chocolate chip cookies = 4 - 1 = 3
   - Remaining sugar cookies = 5 - 1 = 4

3. **Eating Cookies for Lunch:**
   - Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies.
   - Remaining oatmeal cookies = 8 - 2 = 6

4. **Giving Cookies Away:**
   - Randy gives away 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
   - Remaining sugar cookies = 4 - 2 = 2

5. **Baking Cookies for Dinner:**
   - Randy bakes 4 oatmeal cookies.
   - Remaining oatmeal cookies = 6 + 4 = 10
   - Randy bakes 4 chocolate chip cookies.
   - Remaining chocolate chip cookies = 3 + 4 = 7
   - Randy bakes 4 sugar cookies.
   - Remaining sugar cookies = 2 + 4 = 6

After performing all these steps:

- Final count of oatmeal cookies = 10

Step 2: Determine the total value if sold at the agreed price.
- Half of the collection (6 toys) will be sold at $5 each.
- The other half (6 toys) will be sold at $7 each.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the first half of the collection.
\[ \text{Revenue from first half} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]

Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the second half of the collection.
\[ \text{Revenue from second half} = 6 \times \$7 = \$42 \]

Step 5: Add the revenues from both halves to find the total earnings.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Nate to fill in all the holes his dog dug during his vacation. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug during Nate's vacation.
Nate digs 6 holes per day and works for 14 days.
\[ \text{Total holes dug} = 6 \times 14 = 84 \]

### Step 2: Determine the rate at which Nate fills in the holes after returning from vacation.
After returning from vacation, Nate fills in 9 holes per day.

### Step 3: Determine the rate at which Nate digs new holes when he returns.
When Nate returns, his dog digs 6 holes per night (assuming one night per day).

### Step 4: Calculate the net rate at which holes are filled in.
Net rate per day = Rate of filling - Rate of digging
\[ \text{Net rate per day} = 9 - 6 = 3 \, \text{holes/day} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the time required to fill all the holes.
Since Nate fills 3 holes per day, we divide the total number of holes by the net daily rate.
\[ \text{Time to fill all holes} = \frac{84}{3} = 28 \, \text{days} \]

### Step 6: Convert the time into weeks.
\[ \text{Time in weeks} = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \]

### Conclusion:
It takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes his dog dug during his vacation.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes
Then find the net number of holes Nate fill in each day: 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = <<9-6=3>>3 holes/day
Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days
Then divide the number of days by the number of days per week to convert the answer to weeks: 28 days / 7 days/week = <<28/7=4>>4 weeks

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made so far. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the total number of cookies already made**:
   - The Adams family has made 7995 cookies in total.

2. **Subtract the number of rainbow cookies from the total**:
   - There are 2595 rainbow cookies.
   - Subtracting these from the total gives us: 
     \[
     7995 - 2595 = 5400
     \]

3. **Subtract the number of oatmeal cookies from the remaining**:
   - There are 3075 oatmeal cookies.
   - Subtracting these from the current count gives us:
     \[
     5400 - 3075 = 2325
     \]

So, after accounting for all the other types of cookies (rainbow and oatmeal), there are still 2325 cookies left that could be chocolate chip cookies.

4. **Determine the number of chocolate chip cookies**:
   - Since the total number of cookies is 7995 and we have accounted for 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies, the remaining 2325 must be chocolate chip cookies.

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made is \( \boxed{2325} \).<|im_end|>","The total number of pieces of rainbow and oatmeal cookies is 2595 + 3075 = <<2595+3075=5670>>5670.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of items that should have been gathered:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Calculate the total number of items that should have been gathered:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 16 + 7 + 14 = 37
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of items that actually were gathered:**
   - Test tubes: Half as many as requested (16), so \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
   - Beakers: Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested (14), so \( 14 + 2 = 16 \)
   - Petri dishes: Correctly gathered (14)

   Therefore, the actual number of items gathered is:
   \[
   \text{Actual Total} = 8 + 16 + 14 = 38
   \]

4. **Identify the discrepancy between what was supposed to be gathered and what was actually gathered:**
   The difference in numbers indicates that Igor must have lost some items.
   
5. **Calculate the number of beakers lost:**
   - Number of beakers originally intended: 7
   - Number of beakers actually gathered: 16
   
   Since Igor lost some beakers, let’s denote the number of beakers lost as \( x \). We know that the total number of items gathered minus the number of items lost equals the total number of items that should have been gathered:
   \[
   38 = 37 + x
   \]
   
6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 38 - 37 = 1
   \]

Therefore, Igor lost 1 beaker.

### Conclusion:
Igor lost **1** beaker. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{1}\)<|im_end|>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

- There are 4 tables.
- Each table has 4 legs.
So, the total number of legs is \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).

Step 2: Determine the total number of screws needed.
- Each leg requires 2 screws.
So, the total number of screws needed is \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) screws.

Step 3: Calculate the number of screws James has left.
- James initially has 40 screws.
- He needs 32 screws for his tables.
Therefore, the number of screws left over is \( 40 - 32 = 8 \).

- There are twice as many eggs in the second basket.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs in both baskets.
- Let's denote the number of eggs in the second basket as \( x \).
- According to the given information, \( x = 2 \times 10 \).

Step 3: Perform the multiplication for the second basket.
\[ x = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Step 4: Add the number of eggs from both baskets.
- The first basket has 10 eggs.
- The second basket has 20 eggs.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Kim, Alexandra, Maryam, and Sarah raised together. We'll break it down step-by-step.

1. **Calculate how much each person raised:**
   - **Kim:** Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra.
     \[
     \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   
   - **Alexandra:** Alexandra raised $430.
   
   - **Maryam:** Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah.
     \[
     \text{Sarah's amount} = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Sum up the amounts raised by each individual:**
   - **Total amount raised by Kim, Alexandra, and Maryam:**
     \[
     750 + 430 + 700 = 1880 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Add the amount raised by Sarah to the total:**

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many miles Aaron runs.
- According to the problem, ""Aaron was able to run each mile twice.""
- Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we need to find out how many miles Aaron ran.

Let \( A \) be the number of miles Aaron runs. We know that:
\[ A = 2 \times \text{distance Vanessa ran} \]
Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles:
\[ A = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how long it took Aaron to run those miles.
- The total time for the race is given as 16 minutes.
- Aaron ran 8 miles.

Since Aaron runs each mile twice, he will have covered all the distance needed (8 miles).

### Step 3: Calculate how long it takes Vanessa to cover her distance.
- We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- The total time for the race is 16 minutes.

To find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles, we use the fact that she runs at the same speed as Aaron.

Let \( V \) be the time it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles.
We can set up the equation based on their speeds being equivalent:
\[ \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]
Therefore,
\[ \frac{4}{V} = \frac{4}{\text{time Vanessa takes}} \]

Since the distances are equal per mile, we equate them:
\[ \frac{4}{V} = \frac{4}{16} \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ \frac{4}{V} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now solve for \( V \):
\[ V = 4 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 16 \]

So, Vanessa took **16 minutes** to complete her part of the race.<|im_end|>","Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so Aaron ran 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 miles.

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much more line is needed**.
2. **Calculate how much more line is required based on the ratio given**.
3. **Sum up the additional line needed from both types of docks**.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the amount of line needed:**
   - There are two types of docks: one with 200 feet of dock and another with 6 feet of new line.
   - For each foot of dock, he needs 3 feet of line.

   Let's calculate the total length of line needed for all docks combined:
   
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = (\text{Number of docks}) \times (\text{Line per foot of dock}) \times (\text{Line per foot of dock})
   \]

   Given that there are 200 feet of dock and 6 feet of new line:
   
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = (200 \text{ feet of dock}) \times (3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock}) + (6 \text{ feet of new line})
   \]
   
   Simplifying:
   
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = 200 \times 3 + 6 = 600 + 6 = 606 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how much more line is needed**:
   - Since he already has 6 feet of new line, we subtract this amount from the total line needed:
   
   \[
   \text{Additional line needed} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Current line available}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Additional line needed} = 606 - 6 = 600 \text{ feet}

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate daily revenue from reservations
Tom's restaurant has 6 reservation slots per night.

- Each reservation costs $0 (since no amount is specified for a reservation).
- Number of reservations per night = 6

Revenue from reservations per night:
\[ 6 \text{ reservations} \times \$0 = \$0 \]

### Step 2: Calculate total revenue over the number of nights in a week
They operate for 2 days a week.
Number of nights per week = 2

Total revenue per week:
\[ (\$0) \times 2 = \$0 \]

### Step 3: Calculate daily revenue from meals ordered
Each meal costs $5, and there are 2 meals per day.
Number of meals per day = 2

Revenue from meals per day:
\[ 2 \text{ meals/day} \times \$5 \text{ per meal} = \$10 \]

### Step 4: Calculate total revenue from meals over the number of days in a week
They operate for 2 days a week.
Number of days per week = 2

Total revenue from meals per week:
\[ (\$10) \times 2 = \$20 \]

### Step 5: Calculate total revenue from wine purchased
There is one bottle of wine costing $5 per night.
Number of bottles per night = 1

Cost of wine per night:
\[ 1 \text{ bottle/night} \times \$5 \text{ per bottle} = \$5 \]

### Step 6: Calculate total revenue from wine over the number of nights in a week
They operate for 2 nights a week.
Number of nights per week = 2

Total revenue from wine per week:
\[ (\$5) \times 2 = \$10 \]

### Step 7: Add all revenues together
Total weekly revenue:
\[ (\$20 \text{ from meals}) + (\$10 \text{ from wine}) = \$30 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of buying the watermelons:**
   - The vendor spent $80 on 50 watermelons.

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon before profit calculation:**
   - Let \( P \) be the selling price per watermelon.
   - Since there's a profit of 25%, the selling price includes 25% more than the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the selling price \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = \text{purchase price} + (\text{purchase price} \times 0.25)
     \]
     Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     P = \text{purchase price} \times (1 + 0.25) = \text{purchase price} \times 1.25
     \]

3. **Express the total revenue from selling all the watermelons:**
   - If the total revenue is \( R \), then:
     \[
     R = \text{number of watermelons} \times P
     \]
     Substituting the number of watermelons:
     \[
     R = 50 \times P
     \]

4. **Set up an equation to find the purchase price:**
   - We know that the total revenue equals the total cost ($80):
     \[
     50P = 80
     \]
     Solving for \( P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{80}{50} = 1.6
     \]

5. **Verify the total revenue using the calculated selling price:**
   - Using the calculated selling price \( P = 1.6 \):
     \[
     R = 50 \times 1.6 = 80
     \]
     This confirms our calculations are correct.

6. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon:**
   - The selling price per watermelon is already calculated in step 2:
     \[
     P = 1.6
     \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for **$1.6**.<|im_end|>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.
So, he was able to sell them all for $80 + $20 = $<<80+20=100>>100.
Thus, the vendor sold each watermelon for $100/$50 = $<<100/50=2>>2 each.

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>react
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine John's current age
- We know that James is currently twice as old as Dora.
- Let's denote Dora's current age as \( x \).
- Therefore, James' current age is \( 2x \).

Given that James is 19 years old at present, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 19 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \]

So, Dora is currently 9.5 years old.

### Step 2: Calculate John's current age
- Since John is 32 years older than Dora,
\[ \text{John's current age} = 32 + 9.5 = 41.5 \]

### Step 3: Determine how long ago John was 19
- If John was 19 years old, then:
\[ \text{Number of years since John was 19} = 0 \]

This means John was 19 exactly once in the past.

### Step 4: Calculate John's oldest son (James)
- Given that James is now 19 years old, John must have been 19 years old at some point in the past.
- This indicates that James has not yet reached his full potential to reach the age mentioned later in the problem.

### Step 5: Determine Dora's future age
- In 3 years, Dora will be:
\[ 9.5 + 3 = 12.5 \]

So, Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.

### Step 6: Determine John's youngest son's age
- The problem states that John’s youngest son was born when John was 32.
- At 32, John would have had two sons (one James and one younger son).
- So, when John was 32, his youngest son was also 32 because they were twins or very close in age.

Since the problem specifies that John's youngest son turned 12 in 3 years, we need to find out how many years ago John was 32.

Let's denote the number of years ago when John was 32 as \( y \). Then:
\[ 32 - y = 32 \]
\[ y = 0 \]

This implies that John was 32 years old right now. 

Therefore, John's youngest son, being twins, would also be 32 years old in 3 years.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]<|im_end|>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

                    question:
                    There are some oranges in a : basket. Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange and Jane spends 4 minutes doing the same. If Ana and Jane start picking oranges from this basket to peel at the same time, how many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after an hour?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for both Ana and Jane to peel their respective number of oranges and then calculate how many more oranges Ana has peeled compared to Jane after one hour.

1. **Calculate the total amount of time available:**
   - One hour = 60 minutes

2. **Determine the rate at which each person can peel oranges:**
   - Ana peels 3 oranges per minute.
   - Jane peels 4 oranges per minute.

3. **Calculate the total number of oranges each person can peel within the given time:**
   - For Ana: 
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \text{Rate (oranges/minute)} \times \text{Time (minutes)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ oranges}
     \]

   - For Jane:
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \text{Rate (oranges/minute)} \times \text{Time (minutes)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Compare the number of oranges peeled by each:**
   - Ana peels 180 oranges.
   - Jane peels 240 oranges.

5. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Oranges peeled by Jane} - \text{Oranges peeled by Ana}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 240 - 180 = 60 \text{ oranges}
   \]

Therefore, after one hour, Ana will have peeled \(60\) more oranges than Jane. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 60 minutes in an hour. Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes so she will peel 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 oranges in an hour

Ana will have peeled 20-15 = <<20-15=5>>5 more oranges

                    Mark's car breaks ! down and he needs to get a ? new radiator.  The ; cost for a new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for : 80% off.  He ! then ? hires a mechanic to install it and it takes 3 hours at $50 an hour.  How much did he pay?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Mark paid in total, we need to consider both the cost of the radiator and the labor costs associated with installing it.

1. **Calculate the cost after the discount:**
   - Original price of the radiator = $400
   - Discount rate = 80%
   - Amount saved on the radiator = $400 * (80/100) = $400 * 0.8 = $320
   - Price after discount = $400 - $320 = $80

2. **Calculate the labor cost:**
   - Number of hours spent installing the radiator = 3 hours
   - Hourly wage = $50/hour
   - Total labor cost = 3 * $50 = $150

3. **Add the discounted price of the radiator and the labor cost together:**
   - Cost of the radiator after discount = $80
   - Labor cost = $150
   - Total amount paid = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is \boxed{230}.<|im_end|>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either ! chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 ? legs, all ? together. ! How ; many : of the animals are chickens?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Since there are only chickens and cows, let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that there are 20 animals in total:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows also have 4 legs (since they are assumed to be the same as the given problem):
     \[
     2c + 4k = 70
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
     \[
     c + 2k = 35
     \]

   - Now we have two equations:
     \[
     c + k = 20
     \]
     \[
     c + 2k = 35
     \]

   - Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( c \):
     \[
     (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20
     \]
     \[
     k = 15
     \]

   - Substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     c + 15 = 20
     \]
     \[
     c = 5
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 5 chickens on the farm.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 5.<|im_end|>","Let C be the number of chickens.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices:**
   - There are 4 people (Henry + 3 friends).
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - They ordered 7 pizzas.

   First, find the total number of slices from all the pizzas:
   \[
   7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices each person gets if they are divided equally:**
   - Total number of slices (56) should be divided among the 4 people.
   - Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person}
   \]

Thus, each person will get 14 slices.

**Final Answer:**
