Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find out how much money Janet makes from selling her eggs at the farmers' market.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Janet uses for breakfast.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.

### Step 3: Calculate how many eggs remain after breakfast.
Subtract the eggs used for breakfast from the total eggs laid:

\[ \text{Remaining eggs} = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins.
She bakes muffins using 4 eggs.

### Step 5: Determine the number of eggs left over.
Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins from the remaining eggs:

\[ \text{Eggs left over} = 13 - 4 = 9 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the amount of money made from selling the leftover eggs.
Each egg is sold for $2.

\[ \text{Money made} = 9 \times 2 = \$18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$18}
\]<|im_end|>","Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts required for a robe based on the given information about the different types of fibers needed.

Step 1: Determine the amount of blue fiber needed.
- The problem states that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Step 2: Determine the amount of white fiber needed.
- The problem also states that a robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
- Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, then there would be \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) bolt of white fiber.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bolts needed.
- Add the number of bolts of blue fiber to the number of bolts of white fiber.
- Total bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.

Therefore, the total number of bolts required to make one robe is **3**.<|im_end|>","It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber

                    question:
                    Josh decides to try flipping a house.  . He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in ; $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the new value of the house after repairs**

- The original price of the house was $80,000.
- Josh put an additional $50,000 in repairs.

So, the total amount spent on the house is:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000 \]

Now, let's calculate the new value of the house after it has appreciated by 150%.

First, find out what 150% of the original value is:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } \$80,000 = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000 \]

Then add this increase to the original value:
\[ \text{New value of the house} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the profit made**

Josh invested his own money ($50,000) plus the appreciation ($120,000), so the total investment is:
\[ \text{Total investment} = \$50,000 + \$120,000 = \$170,000 \]

The profit can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{New value of the house} - \text{Total investment} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$200,000 - \$170,000 = \$30,000 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$30,000} \]<|im_end|>","The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance James runs in one week given that he runs three sprints three times a week, with each sprint being 60 meters long.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sprints per day.
James runs 3 sprints each time he exercises. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total number of sprints per day is:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/time} \times 3 \text{ times/week} = 9 \text{ sprints/day} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total distance for all sprints in one day.
Each sprint is 60 meters long. Therefore, the total distance for all sprints in one day is:
\[ 9 \text{ sprints/day} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 540 \text{ meters/day} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total distance for all sprints in one week.
Since there are 7 days in a week, the total distance for all sprints in one week is:
\[ 540 \text{ meters/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 3780 \text{ meters/week} \]

Therefore, the total distance James runs in one week is \( \boxed{3780} \) meters.<|im_end|>","He sprints 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 times

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of feed consumed per chicken per day.
- Each chicken consumes 3 cups of feed every day.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of chickens.
- The size of Wendi's flock is given as ""!"" which indicates an unknown quantity but since the value isn't provided directly, we assume it refers to the number of chickens. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( n \).

### Step 3: Calculate the daily feed consumption for all chickens.
- Since each chicken eats 3 cups per day, the total feed consumption for all chickens would be \( 3n \) cups per day.

### Step 4: Use the information about the first two days' feed consumption.
- We know that on the first day (morning), Wendi gave out 15 cups, and on the second day (afternoon), she gave out 25 cups.

### Step 5: Set up the equation for the third day's feed consumption.
- On the third day, let \( x \) represent the number of cups needed for one meal.

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \).
- The total feed consumption over three days should equal the total feed available. Given that there are \( n \) chickens, the total feed consumption over three days is \( 3x \) (since there are 3 meals per day).

Given:
\[ 3x = 15 + 25 + x \]

We can simplify this to find \( x \):
\[ 3x - x = 15 + 25 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{2} \]
\[ x = 20 \]

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 20 cups of feed.<|im_end|>","If each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, then for 20 chickens they would need 3*20=<<3*20=60>>60 cups of feed per day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 16 glasses at different prices based on their positions in the sequence.

Step 1: Determine the price for the first glass.
- The first glass costs $5.

Step 2: Calculate the price for the second glass.
- Every second glass has a discount of 60%, which means it's 40% of its original price (since 100% - 60% = 40%).

\[ \text{Price of second glass} = \$5 \times 0.40 = \$2 \]

Step 3: Determine the price for the third glass.
- Since the third glass is not discounted, it still retains the full price of $5.

Step 4: Continue this pattern for all 16 glasses.
- For even-numbered glasses, they have a 60% discount.
- For odd-numbered glasses, they retain the full price of $5.

Let's list out the prices for each glass:

| Glass | Price |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | $5    |
| 2     | $2    |
| 3     | $5    |
| 4     | $2    |
| 5     | $5    |
| 6     | $2    |
| 7     | $5    |
| 8     | $2    |
| 9     | $5    |
| 10    | $2    |
| 11    | $5    |
| 12    | $2    |
| 13    | $5    |
| 14    | $2    |
| 15    | $5    |
| 16    | $2    |

Now let's sum up the prices for these glasses.

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Cost} &= (\text{Price of 1st glass} + \text{Price of 2nd glass} + ... + \text{Price of 16th glass}) \\
&= (5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 5 + 2) \\
&= 5 \times 5 + 2 \times 6 \\
&= 25 + 12 \\
&= 37
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay **$37** for 16 glasses.<|im_end|>","The discount price of one glass is 60/100 * 5 = $<<60/100*5=3>>3.
If every second glass is cheaper, that means Kylar is going to buy 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 cheaper glasses.
So for the cheaper glasses, Kylar is going to pay 8 * 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.
And for the regular-priced glasses, Kylar will pay 8 * 5 = $<<8*5=40>>40.
So in total Kylar needs to pay 24 + 40 = $<<24+40=64>>64 for the glasses he wants to buy.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep each city has based on the given relationships between them. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in Seattle:**
   - We know that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   
2. **Calculate the number of sheep in Charleston:**
   - According to the information provided, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Number of sheep in Seattle}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Seattle (which is 20):
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse:**
   - Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Number of sheep in Charleston}
     \]
     Substituting the number of sheep in Charleston (which is 80):
     \[
     \text{Number of sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
     \]

Now we have determined the number of sheep for each city:

- Seattle: 20 sheep
- Charleston: 80 sheep
- Toulouse: 160 sheep

Finally, let's add up all the sheep from these cities:
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total number of sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is \boxed{260}.<|im_end|>","If Seattle has 20 sheep, Charleston has 4 * 20 sheep = <<20*4=80>>80 sheep

<|im_start|>middleware
To determine how long it will take Carla to complete her download after restarting, we need to break down the process into two parts: before and after the restart.

1. **Calculate the time taken before the restart:**
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - Before the restart, Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute.
   - She can only download for 60% of the total time because Windows forced a restart after 40%.

Let's calculate the time before the restart:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Size}}{\text{Download Rate}} \]

Before the restart, she can only download for 60% of the total time:

\[ \text{Time before restart} = \frac{200}{2} \times 0.6 = 100 \text{ minutes} \]

2. **Calculate the time taken after the restart:**
   - After the restart, she needs to download the remaining 40% of the file at the same speed.
   - The remaining part of the file is \(200 \text{ GB} - (200 \text{ GB} \times 0.4) = 80 \text{ GB}\).

Now, let's calculate the time needed to download the remaining 80 GB at 2 GB per minute:

\[ \text{Time after restart} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

3. **Add the time together:**
   - Time before the restart: 100 minutes
   - Time after the restart: 40 minutes
   - Total time = 100 + 40 = 140 minutes

So, the total time it will take Carla to download the entire file after restarting is 140 minutes.<|im_end|>","First find how many gigabytes are in 40% of the file: 200 GB * 40% = <<200*40*.01=80>>80 GB

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how far John is from home after his trip, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.

1. **Initial Trip:**
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time = 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John realizes he needs to return home.
   - Total time available for the round trip is 4 hours.
   - Time spent in traffic = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2 hours = 2 hours
   - Speed during the second leg (return) = 80 mph
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 mph × 2 hours = 160 miles

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- Initial trip distance: 180 miles
- Return trip distance: 160 miles

Total distance from home = 180 miles + 160 miles = 340 miles

Therefore, John is **340 miles** away from home at the end of those 4 hours.<|im_end|>","When he turned around he was 3*60=<<3*60=180>>180 miles from home

<|im_start|>user

To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down the problem into smaller parts and calculate step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of regular hours and overtime hours.
- Regular hours = First 40 hours
- Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours

Given:
- Total hours worked = 45 hours
- Regular hourly rate = $10/hour

Regular hours (first 40 hours) = 40 hours

Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

### Step 2: Calculate the earnings from regular hours.
Eliza earns at her regular rate for the first 40 hours.

Earnings from regular hours = Regular hours * Regular hourly rate
= 40 hours * $10/hour
= $400

### Step 3: Calculate the earnings from overtime hours.
Eliza earns at her overtime rate for the additional hours beyond 40 hours.

Overtime rate = Regular hourly rate * 1.2
= $10/hour * 1.2
= $12/hour

Earnings from overtime hours = Overtime hours * Overtime rate
= 5 hours * $12/hour

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   - We know that the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   - According to the problem, the number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads from the first month.
   - Calculation: \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) downloads.

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   - After reducing the second month's downloads by 30%, we need to calculate this reduction.
   - Reduction calculation: \( 180 \times 0.30 = 54 \).
   - Therefore, the third month's downloads would be \( 180 - 54 = 126 \).

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   - Summing up all the downloads from each month gives us the total number of downloads.
   - Calculation: \( 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \).

**Final Answer:** The total number of downloads over the three months is {366}.<|im_end|>","The number of downloads of the program in the second month increased to 3*60 = <<3*60=180>>180

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Toula bought at the bakery. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times \$68
\]

\[
\text{Cost of donuts} = \$204
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = 2 \times \$80
\]

\[
\text{Cost of mini cupcakes} = \$160
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = 6 \times \$55
\]

\[
\text{Cost of mini cheesecakes} = \$330
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs
Now, let's add up the costs of all the items Toula bought:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of donuts} + \text{Cost of mini cupcakes} + \text{Cost of mini cheesecakes}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$204 + \$160 + \$330
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$794
\]

Therefore, the total cost of all the items Toula bought is **$794**.<|im_end|>","The total charge for the doughnuts was 3 x $68 = $<<3*68=204>>204.

                    question:
                    Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it , take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it takes for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then divide the total initial investment by this annual profit.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Cost**:
   - The tree itself costs $90.
   
2. **Annual Profit Calculation**:
   - **Growth in Lemons**: Carlos grows 7 lemons each year.
   - **Price per Lemon**: He sells these lemons for $1.5 each.
   - **Total Annual Revenue from Selling Lemons** = Number of Lemons × Price per Lemon
     \[
     7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.5/\text{lemon} = \$10.50
     \]

3. **Costs**:
   - **Water and Feed Costs**: This is $3 annually.

4. **Net Profit per Year**:
   - Net Profit per Year = Total Revenue from Lemons - Water and Feed Costs
     \[
     \$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
     \]

5. **Time to Start Earning Money**:
   - To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to earn at least one dollar, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year.
     \[
     \frac{\$90}{\$7.50 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years}
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - After 12 years, Carlos will have started earning money from the lemon tree because the first year's revenue ($7.50) covers the initial investment of $90.

Therefore, it will take **12 years** before Carlos starts earning money from the lemon tree.<|im_end|>","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5

It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12
He will make money in year 13 because 12 + 1 = <<12+1=13>>13

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the fraction of vacuum cleaners sold:**
   - Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners.
   
2. **Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold:**
   - Since there were originally \( x \) vacuum cleaners and she sold a third, that means \( \frac{1}{3}x \) were sold.

3. **Account for additional sales:**
   - She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
   
4. **Express remaining vacuum cleaners after these sales:**
   - After selling a third and then 2 more, the remaining vacuum cleaners are \( x - \left(\frac{1}{3}x + 2\right) = \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \).

5. **Calculate the fraction of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   - Half of the remaining vacuum cleaners were sold at the orange house.
   
6. **Express the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house:**
   - The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is \( \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right) \).

7. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - We know that after all these sales, Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   - So, \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right) = 5 \).
   
8. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation first: \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right) = 5 \).
   - Distribute \(-\frac{1}{2}\): \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 - \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{3}x + 1 = 5 \).
   - Combine like terms: \( \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).
   - Simplify further: \( \frac{2}{3}x - \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).
   - Combine fractions: \( \frac{1}{3}x - 1 = 5 \).
   
9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Add 1 to both sides: \( \frac{1}{3}x = 6 \).
   - Multiply both sides by 3: \( x = 18 \).

Therefore, Melanie started with **18** vacuum cleaners.<|im_end|>","First multiply the five remaining vacuum cleaners by two to find out how many Melanie had before she visited the orange house: 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total number of students**: 20
2. **Contemporary dance enrollment**: 20% of 20 = \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \) students
3. **Remaining students after contemporary dance**: 
   - Total students - Contemporary dancers = Remaining students = \( 20 - 4 = 16 \)
4. **Jazz dance enrollment**: 25% of the remaining students (after contemporary dance). Since we know there are 16 students left after contemporary dance, this means \( 25\% \) of these 16 students enroll in jazz dance.
   - Jazz dance enrollment = \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \) students

Now that we have the numbers for both jazz dance and contemporary dance, we can find out how many students are left to be enrolled in hip-hop dance.

5. **Hip-hop dance enrollment**:
   - Students remaining after contemporary and jazz dances = \( 16 - 4 = 12 \)

So, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Finally, to find the percentage of students who are enrolled in hip-hop dance, divide the number of hip-hop dancers by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of hip-hop dancers}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 60%.<|im_end|>","There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.

There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.

<|im_start|>user

To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit for the merchant, we need to calculate the future value of both options after considering their respective growth rates.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the future value of Jewelry**:
   - Initial value of Jewelry = $5,000
   - Growth rate (r) = 2.5% = 0.025
   - Time period (t) = 1 month

   The formula for compound interest (or in this case, exponential growth) is given by:
   \[
   FV = P(1 + r)^t
   \]
   where \(P\) is the principal amount ($5,000), \(r\) is the growth rate (0.025), and \(t\) is the time period (1).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Jewelry}} = 5000 \times (1 + 0.025)^1
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Jewelry}} = 5000 \times 1.025
   \]
   Then multiplying:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Jewelry}} = 5125
   \]

2. **Calculate the future value of Electronic Gadgets**:
   - Initial value of Electronic Gadgets = $8,000
   - Growth rate (r) = 1.2% = 0.012
   - Time period (t) = 1 month

   Using the same formula:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Gadgets}} = 8000 \times (1 + 0.012)^1
   \]
   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Gadgets}} = 8000 \times 1.012
   \]
   Then multiplying:
   \[
   FV_{\text{Gadgets}} = 8104
   \]

3. **Compare the Future Values**:
   - Future value of Jewelry = $5,125
   - Future value of Electronic Gadgets = $8,104

Since $8,104 > $5,125, the electronic gadgets offer more profit.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is $\boxed{8104}$.<|im_end|>","If he purchases jewelry, he will make a profit of 2.5% which is $5000*(2.5/100) = $<<5000*(2.5/100)=125>>125

                    question:
                    Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered ; by each train in the two days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

### Day 1: Westward Travel
- Both trains start from San Rafael.
- Each train travels 80 miles towards the west.

Since there are only two trains, the total distance traveled on the first day will be:

\[ \text{Total Distance on Day 1} = 2 \times 80 \text{ miles} = 160 \text{ miles} \]

### Day 2: Northward Travel
- After the first day, both trains continue their journey but now travel in opposite directions (northwards).
- Each train covers an additional 150 miles northwards.

So, for one train, the total distance covered after the second day will be:

\[ \text{Total Distance on Day 2} = 150 \text{ miles} \]

And since there are two trains, the combined total distance covered over the two days will be:

\[ \text{Combined Total Distance Over Two Days} = 2 \times (160 + 150) \text{ miles} = 2 \times 310 \text{ miles} = 620 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is as follows:

- **First Train:** 160 miles
- **Second Train:** 160 miles

However, if you want to consider the total distance covered by both trains collectively, it would be:

\[ \text{Total Combined Distance} = 620 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{620 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","On the first day, the trains covered 2 trains * 80 miles/train = <<2*80=160>>160 miles together.

The combined distance the two trains covered in the two days is 300 miles + 160 miles = <<300+160=460>>460 miles
The average distance for the two days is 460 miles / 2 trains = <<460/2=230>>230 miles/train

<|im_start|>user
To determine Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate both her earnings from teaching and her earnings from being a cheerleading coach separately, then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Earnings from Teaching:
1. **Hourly Pay Rate for Teaching**: $20/hour
2. **Number of Weeks Worked in a Year**: 50 weeks
3. **Number of Hours Per Week Working as a Teacher**: 35 hours
4. **Total Hours Worked as a Teacher in a Year**:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year}
   \]

   Let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 35 \times 50 = 1750 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Earnings from Teaching**:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Teaching)} = \text{Hourly Pay Rate} \times \text{Total Hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Teaching)} = \$20/\text{hour} \times 1750 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Let's perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Teaching)} = 20 \times 1750 = \$35,000
   \]

#### Earnings from Being a Cheerleading Coach:
1. **Hourly Pay Rate for Coaching**: $30/hour
2. **Number of Weeks Worked in a Year**: 50 weeks
3. **Number of Hours Per Week Working as a Coach**: 15 hours
4. **Total Hours Worked as a Coach in a Year**:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 15 \text{ hours/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year}
   \]

   Let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 15 \times 50 = 750 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Earnings from Coaching**:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Coaching)} = \text{Hourly Pay Rate} \times \text{Total Hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Coaching)} = \$30/\text{hour} \times 750 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Let's perform the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary (Coaching)} = 30 \times 750 = \$22,500
   \]

#### Total Annual Salary:
1. **Sum of Both Salaries**:
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Salary (Teaching)} + \text{Annual Salary (Coaching)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Annual Salary} = \$35,000 + \$22,500
   \]

   Let's perform the addition:

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many dozen eggs Claire eats over 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs per meal:**
   - Claire makes one 3-egg omelet.

2. **Determine the total number of meals per week:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, Claire has \(7\) meals per week.

3. **Calculate the total number of meals in 4 weeks:**
   \[
   7 \text{ meals/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 28 \text{ meals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed in 4 weeks:**
   - Each meal consists of 3 eggs.
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/meal} \times 28 \text{ meals} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen.
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen eggs}

                    question:
                    Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining , distance?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the speed Marissa needs to achieve her desired average speed, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required for the entire hike:**
   - Time taken for the first part of the hike: 1 hour.
   - Time taken for the second part of the hike: 1 hour.

   Total time = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.

2. **Determine the total distance Marissa wants to cover at her target average speed:**
   - The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.

3. **Set up an equation based on the formula for average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
   \]
   Let \( v \) be the speed in miles per hour that Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance.

   We know her target average speed should be 4 miles per hour, so:
   \[
   4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**
   \[
   4 = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( v \):**
   \[
   v = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of **6 miles per hour** to achieve her goal of walking at 4 miles per hour over the total distance.<|im_end|>","First figure out how many hours it takes to hike a 12-mile trail at 4 mph by dividing the distance by the speed: 12 miles / 4 mph = <<12/4=3>>3 hours

                    question:
                    I have : 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter ; of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the amount of water in the original orange drink**

- The orange drink has a total volume of 10 liters.
- It consists of two-thirds water.

First, calculate the volume of water in the orange drink:
\[ \text{Volume of water} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Volume of water} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are approximately **6.67 liters of water** in the original orange drink.

**Step 2: Calculate the initial amount of water in the pineapple drink**

- The pineapple drink has a total volume of 15 liters.
- It also consists of three-fifths water.

Calculate the volume of water in the pineapple drink:
\[ \text{Volume of water} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume of water} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

So, there are **9 liters of water** in the pineapple drink.

**Step 3: Account for the spilled orange drink**

- Initially, you poured out one liter from the orange drink.
- This means the remaining orange drink is:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the new volumes after spilling**

- After pouring out one liter, the remaining orange drink has:
\[ 9 \text{ liters} \]

- Since all of this orange drink was replaced with the pineapple drink, we now have:
\[ 9 \text{ liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink} = 24 \text{ liters total drink}\]

**Step 5: Recalculate the total volume of water in the mixed drink**

Now, let's determine how much water is left after adding the pineapple drink to the remaining orange drink (which is now 9 liters).

The volume of water in the mixed drink will be the sum of the water in the remaining orange drink and the water in the added pineapple drink:
\[ \text{Total volume of water} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 + \frac{3}{5} \times 15 \]

Let's do the calculations:

- Volume of water in the remaining orange drink:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters} \]

- Volume of water in the added pineapple drink:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Adding these together gives us the total volume of water in the mixed drink:
\[ 6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is **15 liters**. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {15}.<|im_end|>","There are 15 x 3/5 = <<15*3/5=9>>9 liters of water from the 15 liters pineapple drink.
After 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, there were 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 liters of orange drink left.
Out of the 9 liters, 9 x 2/3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 liters are water.
Thus, there are a total of 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 liters of water out of the 24 liters.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's birth year.
2. Calculate when Raymond's son was born.
3. Subtract this birth year from Samantha's current age.

**Step 1: Determine Raymond's birth year**

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can calculate his birth year as follows:
- Samantha's birth year = 31 (Samantha's current age) - 6 (years difference)
- Samantha's birth year = 25

So, Raymond was born in 1997 (2022 - 25).

**Step 2: Calculate when Raymond's son was born**

Raymond has a son who was born at the age of 23. Therefore, we add 23 years to Raymond's birth year to find out when his son was born:
- Raymond's son's birth year = 1997 + 23
- Raymond's son's birth year = 2020

**Step 3: Subtract this birth year from Samantha's current age**

Now that we know Raymond's son was born in 2020, we subtract this year from Samantha's current age to find out how many years ago it was:
- Years since Raymond's son was born = 31 (current age of Samantha) - 20 (year of Raymond's son's birth)
- Years since Raymond's son was born = 11

Therefore, Raymond's son was born **11 years ago**.<|im_end|>","When Raymond's son was born Samantha was 23 - 6 = <<23-6=17>>17 years old.

   - Next 2 customers: Each buys 2 DVDs.
     \[ 2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs} \]

3. **Calculate the total number of DVDs sold**:
   - From the first group: \(3\) DVDs

To determine how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time the candle has been burning**:
   - The candle burned for a period from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
   - From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is 1 hour.
   - From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is another 1 hour.
   - From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is yet another 1 hour.
   - From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is one more hour.
   
   Therefore, the total duration of burning is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\) hours.

2. **Determine the melting rate of the candle**:
   - The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour.

3. **Calculate the total amount melted over the given period**:
   - Since the candle melts at 2 cm/hour for 4 hours, the total melting length is \(2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours}\).

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the book before any discounts were applied.

Step 1: Understand the given information.
- Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount.
- The discounted amount represents 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the given information.
Let \( P \) represent the original price of the book.
Since Kyle paid 75% of the original price after a 25% discount, we can write:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

Step 3: Solve for the original price \( P \).
We need to isolate \( P \). To do this, divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Step 4: Perform the division.
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

Final Answer: The final answer is \(\boxed{26}\).<|im_end|>","Let X be the original price of the book. The discounted price is X - X*25% = $19.50.

To determine how much Mishka spent in total on her clothing items, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing (shorts, pants, and shoes) separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Shorts:
1. **Number of pairs**: Mishka bought 3 pairs.
2. **Cost per pair**: Each pair costs $16.50.
   - Total cost = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$16.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$50.50
   \]

#### Pants:
1. **Number of pairs**: Mishka bought 3 pairs.
2. **Cost per pair**: Each pair costs $22.50.
   - Total cost = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$22.50

#### Shoes:
1. **Number of pairs**: Mishka bought 3 pairs.
2. **Cost per pair**: Each pair costs $42.
   - Total cost = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$126
   \]

### Summing Up All Costs:
Now, add the total costs from each category to find the overall amount Mishka spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$50.50 + \$67.50 + \$126
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$244
\]

### Final Answer:
Mishka spent a total of \( \boxed{244} \) dollars on all the clothing items.<|im_end|>","3 * (16.50 + 22.50 + 42) = $<<3*(16.50+22.50+42)=243>>243

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Cynthia spends on ice cream over 60 days. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of servings of ice cream Cynthia consumes in 60 days.
Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. There are 30 nights in a month (assuming there are 30 days in a month for simplicity).

\[
\text{Total servings} = \text{Number of nights} \times \text{Servings per night}
\]

\[
\text{Total servings} = 60 \times 1 = 60 \text{ servings}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of cartons of ice cream needed.
Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream.

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of cartons} = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Each carton costs $4.00.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 \times 4.00 = \$16.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total distance**: The entire trip is 60 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first stop**:
   - Henry made his first stop at 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the remaining distance to reach the end of the trip is \(60 - 20 = 40\) miles.

3. **Calculate the distance of the second stop**:
   - Henry's second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - Since the trip ends at 60 miles, his second stop is at \(60 - 15 = 45\) miles from the start.

4. **Find the distance between the first and second stops**:
   - The first stop is at 20 miles.
   - The second stop is at 45 miles.
   - The distance between these two stops is \(45 - 20 = 25\) miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

{The final answer is} 25 miles.<|im_end|>","He traveled 20 miles + 15 miles = <<20+15=35>>35 miles not counting the distance between stops.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - We know that one pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair also costs twice as much.

2. **Calculate the cost of the second pair of high heels:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the second pair} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66
   \]

3. **Determine the combined cost of both pairs of high heels:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of high heels} = \$33 + \$66 = \$99
   \]

4. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots.
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the boots plus the high heels equals $5 less than the cost of the boots.

   Therefore,
   \[
   B + (\$33 + \$66) = B - \$5
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   B + \$99 = B - \$5
   \]

6. **Subtract \( B \) from both sides to isolate the constant terms:**
   \[
   \$99 = -\$5
   \]

7. **Add \$5 to both sides to solve for \( B \):**
   \[
   \$99 + \$5 = B
   \]
   \[
   B = \$104
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The boots cost $104.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    Darrell : and Allen's ages are in , the ratio of 7:11. If their total age now is 162, calculate Allen's age 10 , years from now.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen**
2. **Calculate how long ago they were born**
3. **Add 10 years to their current age**

### Step 1: Determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen

Given that their ages are in the ratio \(7:11\) and their total age is \(162\), let's denote their ages as follows:
- Let \(x\) be the common factor for both ages.

Since the ratio is \(7:11\), if we multiply one part of the ratio by \(x\) and another part by \(\frac{x}{7}\) (since \(7 + 11 = 18\)), we get their combined age equation:
\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Simplify the left side:
\[18x = 162\]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

So, Darrell’s age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen’s age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

### Step 2: Calculate how long ago they were born

Now, since their ages add up to \(162\), they have lived for:
\[ \text{Total life span} = \frac{162}{2} = 81 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the time between when they were born and now is:
\[ \text{Time since birth} = 81 \text{ years} \]

### Step 3: Add 10 years to their current age

Finally, we add 10 years to their current age:
- Darrell’s age 10 years from now: \(63 + 10 = 73\)
- Allen’s age 10 years from now: \(99 + 10 = 109\)

Thus, the ages will be:
- Darrell’s age 10 years from now: \(73\)
- Allen’s age 10 years from now: \(109\)

### Conclusion

The final answer is:
{The final answer is}
\[ \boxed{73 \text{ for Darrel, } 109 \text{ for Allen}} \]<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing their ages is 7+11= <<7+11=18>>18

To find the average guess for the number of jelly beans in the jar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the guesses from each friend.
2. Calculate the sum of all guesses.
3. Divide the total sum by the number of guesses (which is three).

Let's start with the guesses:

- The first friend thinks there are 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend thinks there are 20 more than half of what the first friend guessed. So, half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than that would be 60.

So far, the guesses are: 80, 60, and 25 (since 25% of 80 is 20, plus 20 more equals 40, then 20 more makes it 60).

Now let's calculate the sum of these guesses:
\[ 80 + 60 + 25 = 165 \]

Finally, we divide this sum by the number of guesses (three):
\[ \frac{165}{3} = 55 \]

To determine how many hours John spends walking and caring for his dogs each week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent on each dog:**
   - Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day.
   - John has 10 dogs.

2. **Find out the total daily time spent on all dogs:**
   - Total daily time = Number of dogs × Time per dog per day
   - Total daily time = \( 10 \times 0.5 \) hours/day = 5 hours/day

3. **Calculate the weekly time spent on all dogs:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly time = Total daily time × Number of days in a week
   - Weekly time = \( 5 \) hours/day × 7 days/week = 35 hours/week

Therefore, John spends a total of **35 hours** a week taking care of his dogs.<|im_end|>","He spends 10*.5=<<10*.5=5>>5 hours per day

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gold coins Gretchen has based on the information given about her total number of coins and the relationship between the number of gold and silver coins.

Step 1: Define variables.
Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.
Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

Step 2: Set up equations based on the given information.
We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Therefore,
\[ G + S = 110 \]

We also know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Step 3: Substitute the second equation into the first equation.
Substitute \( G = S + 30 \) into \( G + S = 110 \):
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( S \).
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

Step 5: Find \( G \) using the value of \( S \).
Since \( G = S + 30 \),
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.

To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry will consume in 30 days:**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, he will eat \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) yogurts.

2. **Determine the cost of one yogurt from the sale:**
   - The current price of 4 yogurts is $5.00.
   - Therefore, the price of one yogurt is \( \frac{5}{4} = \$1.25 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for 60 yogurts:**
   - Since each yogurt costs $1.25, the total cost for 60 yogurts is \( 60 \times 1.25 = \$75 \).

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets.
John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each.

\[
13 \times 15 = 195
\]

So, John made $195 from selling his Lego sets.

### Step 2: Determine how much money John spent on video games.
John bought 8 video games for $20 each.

\[
8 \times 20 = 160
\]

So, John spent $160 on video games.

### Step 3: Calculate how much money John had after buying the video games.
We know that John has $5 left after making the purchases.

\[
195 - 160 + 5 = 40
\]

So, John has $40 left after spending on video games.

### Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John can buy with the remaining money.
Each Lego set costs $15.

\[
\frac{40}{15} = 2.67
\]

Since John cannot buy a fraction of a Lego set, we need to find out how many whole Lego sets he can afford based on the available budget.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of Lego sets John still has.
He initially had 13 Lego sets.

After spending on video games, he used $40. Since he only needs $15 per set, he can buy:

\[
\frac{40}{15} = 2.67 \text{ sets}
\]

But since he only buys complete sets, he can buy 2 full sets.

Therefore, the number of Lego sets John still has is:

\[
13 - 2 = 11
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **11**.<|im_end|>","He spent $160 on video games because 8 x 20 = <<8*20=160>>160

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time for the week.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours John runs in a week:**
   - John runs 3 days a week.
   - Each day, he runs for a different amount of time.
   - The first day, he runs for 3 hours.
   - The second day, he runs for half the time of the first day (which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours).
   - The third day, he runs for half the time of the second day (which is \( \frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75 \) hours).

   Adding these times together gives us the total running time for the week:
   \[
   3 + 1.5 + 0.75 = 5.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine John's average speed:**
   - John runs a total distance of 60 miles in a week.
   - We need to find out how many miles he runs per hour on average.

   To do this, divide the total distance by the total running time:
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{5.25 \text{ hours}}
   \]

   Simplify the division:
   \[
   \frac{60}{5.25} = \frac{60}{\frac{21}{4}} = \frac{60 \times 4}{21} = \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.43 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Therefore, John runs at an average speed of approximately 11.43 miles per hour.<|im_end|>","He has 7-1=<<7-1=6>>6 possible running days.

                    question:
                    Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, but ? she can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run. If she can skip at 3 : miles per hour, how many miles ? can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Dana's walking speed:**
   - We know that Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
   - Skip = Half Run (SR)
   - So, Run = 2 * Skip = 2 * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour.

2. **Calculate Dana's running speed:**
   - Running is 4 times faster than walking.
   - Let W be her walking speed.
   - Then, Run = 4W.
   - Given that Run = 6 miles per hour,
     \[
     4W = 6 \implies W = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, her running speed is 6 miles per hour.

3. **Determine the total distance traveled in six hours:**
   - She spends one-third of the time running.
   - One-third of six hours is 2 hours.
   - In 2 hours running, she travels:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining time spent walking:**
   - The rest of the time, which is two-thirds of six hours, is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Determine the distance walked in these 4 hours:**
   - Her walking speed is 1.5 miles per hour.
   - So, in 4 hours, she walks:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Sum up all distances to find the total distance traveled in six hours:**
   - Distance from running + Distance from walking:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","If Dana can skip at half the speed she can run, then she can run at 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 miles per hour.
And since she can run at a speed that is 4 times faster than she can walk, this means she can walk at 6/4=1.5 miles per hour.
If two-thirds of the time is spent walking, then she walks for 6*(2/3)=<<6*(2/3)=4>>4 hours.
If one-third of the time is spent running, then she runs for 6-4=<<6-4=2>>2 hours.
Thus, she runs for 2 hours at 6 miles per hour, or 2*6=<<2*6=12>>12 miles.
She walks for 4 hours at 1.5 miles per hour, or 4*1.5=<<4*1.5=6>>6 miles.
Thus, altogether, she travels 12+6=<<12+6=18>>18 miles.

To determine Brandon's iPhone age, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Ben's iPhone age** based on Suzy's iPhone age.
2. **Use that information** to find Brandon's iPhone age.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine Ben's iPhone Age
Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we know:
\[ \text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone} \]

Substitute the given value for Suzy's iPhone:
\[ \text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

So, Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.

#### Step 2: Determine Brandon's iPhone Age
We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone:
\[ \text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone} \]

Substitute the value found in Step 1:
\[ \text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

Thus, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.

                    question:
                    The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.  , Polly could throw the gold javelin, the only known weapon : that could sleigh the dragon, for a distance of 400 feet, well ? within the reach of the dragon's flames.  But when Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to throw the javelin at a distance greater than or equal to 400 feet.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Dragon's Reach**:
   - The dragon has a range of 1000 feet.
   - This means the dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away.

2. **Polly’s Initial Range Without Gemstone**:
   - Polly can throw the javelin a distance of 400 feet without any gemstone.
   
3. **Effect of Holding the Sapphire Gemstone**:
   - When Polly holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding it.
   - Therefore, if she throws the javelin with the gemstone, her maximum throwing distance becomes \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \).

4. **Determining the Maximum Safe Distance**:
   - To find out how far Polly can stand and still be within the dragon’s reach, we need to calculate where the dragon would be if it was at its maximum possible position (i.e., at the edge of the 1000-foot radius).
   - Since the dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away, it means the dragon can potentially attack within a 1000-foot circle around itself.
   - Therefore, the maximum safe distance Polly can stand from the dragon such that she can still throw the javelin beyond the dragon's reach is 1000 feet minus the additional distance gained from holding the gemstone.

5. **Calculating the Final Distance**:
   - With the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, but since the dragon's reach is limited to 1000 feet, she needs to stay more than 1000 feet away from the dragon.
   - Thus, the effective distance Polly must maintain is 1000 feet plus the additional 200 feet (since 1200 - 400 = 800 feet, but she gains an extra 200 feet due to holding the gemstone).

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The final answer is: Polly should stand 1200 feet away from the dragon to ensure she can still throw the javelin beyond the dragon's reach.

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{1200}\)<|im_end|>","With the gemstone, Polly could throw the javelin 3 times farther than 400 feet, for a distance of 3*400=<<3*400=1200>>1200 feet.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pieces of pie.
Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies. Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total pieces} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

So, there were 40 pieces of pie initially.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests.
At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left.

\[
\text{Pieces taken by guests} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Remaining pieces}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Pieces taken by guests} = 40 - 14 = 26
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of pie that the guests took is **26**.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings in the bag
Given that there are 5 servings in a 300g bag.

### Step 2: Determine the number of servings left before reaching the daily limit
If your daily calorie goal is 2000 calories and you've already consumed 1800 calories, then you need to reach your goal by consuming only 200 calories more (since 2000 - 1800 = 200).

### Step 3: Convert the remaining calories needed from calories to servings
Since each serving contains 250 calories, we divide the remaining calories (200) by the number of calories per serving (250):
\[ \text{Remaining servings} = \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of chips you can eat based on the remaining servings
There are 5 servings in total. Therefore, for 0.8 servings, you can eat:
\[ \text{Chips eaten} = 0.8 \times 300 \text{g} = 240 \text{g} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, according to the information provided, you can eat **240 grams** of chips if you want to stay within your daily calorie target.<|im_end|>","If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat

We also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams
If I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams

To determine Charlie's net profit from selling candles made from beeswax, let's break down the problem into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Candles Made
Charlie can make 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax.

- Number of pounds of beeswax used = 20 (since he plans to make 20 candles).
- Since 1 pound gives 10 candles, 20 pounds will give \(20 \times 10 = 200\) candles.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue from Sales
Each candle is sold for $2.00.
- Revenue from 200 candles = \(200 \times \$2.00 = \$400\).

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost of Supplies
Charlie spends $10.00 on supplies for one pound of beeswax and one wick.
- Cost for 20 pounds of beeswax and 20 wicks = \(20 \times \$10.00 = \$200\).

### Step 4: Calculate Net Profit
Net profit = Revenue - Cost
- Net profit = \$400 (revenue) - \$200 (cost) = \$200.

### Conclusion
Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles is **\$200**.<|im_end|>","1 pound of beeswax and the wick make 10 candles and he wants to make 20 candles so he needs 20/10 = <<20/10=2>>2 pounds of beeswax
1 pound of beeswax costs $10.00 and he needs 2 pounds so his supplies will cost 10*2 = $<<10*2=20.00>>20.00
He wants to sell each candle for $2.00 each and he's selling 20 candles so that's 2*20 = $<<2*20=40.00>>40.00
If he makes $40.00 selling candles and his supplies cost $20.00 then his net profit is 40-20 = $<<40-20=20.00>>20.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of articles written on each day:**

   - **Monday**: 
     Since we don't have specific information about the number of articles written on Monday, we'll assume this value is given or known from previous context (which isn't provided here).

   - **Tuesday**:
     She wrote \( \frac{3}{5} \) times more articles on Tuesday compared to Monday.

   - **Wednesday**:
     She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

2. **Sum up the articles for each day**:
   
   Let’s denote the number of articles written on Monday as \( M \). Then:
   - Articles on Monday = \( M \)
   - Articles on Tuesday = \( \frac{3}{5}M \)
   - Articles on Wednesday = \( 2 \times \frac{3}{5}M \)

   Therefore, the total number of articles for all three days would be:
   \[
   M + \frac{3}{5}M + 2 \times \frac{3}{5}M
   \]

3. **Simplify the expression**:
   \[
   M + \frac{3}{5}M + \frac{6}{5}M
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   M(1 + \frac{3}{5} + \frac{6}{5})
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   1 + \frac{3}{5} + \frac{6}{5} = 1 + \frac{9}{5} = \frac{14}{5}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   M \times \frac{14}{5}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent**:
   Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Thus, the total time spent writing articles can be calculated as:
   \[
   (\text{Number of articles}) \times (\text{Time per article in hours})
   \]
   Substituting our simplified sum:
   \[
   \left(M \times \frac{14}{5}\right) \times 4
   \]

5. **Final calculation**:
   Multiply these together:
   \[
   M \times \frac{14}{5} \times 4
   \]
   Distribute the multiplication:
   \[
   M \times \frac{56}{5}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{56M}{5}}
\]<|im_end|>","If she wrote five articles on Monday, then on Tuesday she wrote 2/5* 5 = 2 more articles.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many post-it notes were in the package Candice purchased. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial number of post-it notes**: Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.

2. **Post-it notes used**:
   - She placed one post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.
   - Therefore, she used \(220\) post-it notes for the coffee cups.

3. **Remaining post-it notes after using them**: 
   \[
   80 \text{ (initial)} - 220 \text{ (used)} = -140 \text{ (remaining)}
   \]
   This negative value indicates an error because she cannot have fewer post-it notes than she started with. We need to correct our approach.

4. **Correct calculation**:
   - The total number of post-it notes she has at any point must equal the sum of those she initially had and those added from the purchase.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased.

5. **Total post-it notes at any time**:
   \[
   80 + x \text{ (initial)} + \text{(post-it notes used)} = \text{(total post-it notes)}
   \]

6. **Final count of post-it notes**: According to the problem, she has 23 post-it notes remaining.
   \[
   (80 + x) - (\text{post-it notes used}) = 23
   \]

7. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - We know she has 23 post-it notes left after placing 220 on the coffee cups.
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
     \[
     (80 + x) - 220 = 23
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     80 + x - 220 = 23
     \]
     \[
     x - 140 = 23
     \]
     \[
     x = 163
     \]

Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is \(163\).<|im_end|>","Let's let x be the number of post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased.
Then, the total number of post-it notes she had when she left the store was 80+x.

2. **Calculate the total number of red ties John bought:**
   - John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times (\text{Number of blue ties}) = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the ties:**
   - Red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - Blue ties cost $40 each.

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} + (0.5 \times \text{Cost per blue tie}) = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

4. **Sum up the total amount spent on both types of ties:**

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for blue ties} + \text{Total cost for red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{800}
\]<|im_end|>","He bought 200 / 40 = <<200/40=5>>5 blue ties

So they each cost $40 + $20 = $<<40+20=60>>60
So he spent $60 * 10 = $<<60*10=600>>600 on red ties
So he spent $200 + $600 = $<<200+600=800>>800 on ties

To solve this problem, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit and then perform the necessary calculations.

Step 1: Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches.
- We know that 1 foot = 12 inches.
- Therefore, 4 feet = 4 × 12 = 48 inches.

Step 2: Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from the total length of 48 inches.
- To find out how many 6-inch pieces can be obtained from 48 inches, we divide 48 by 6.
- So, 48 ÷ 6 = 8.

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire, each measuring 6 inches long.<|im_end|>","If Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long, since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, the total length of the wire in inches was 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48 inches.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building:**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.

\[
\text{Total number of units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor}
\]

2. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**

\[
\text{Total number of units} = 15 \times 8 = 120
\]

3. **Determine the fraction of the building that is occupied:**
   - It is stated that \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.

4. **Calculate the number of occupied units:**
   - Multiply the total number of units by the occupancy fraction.

\[
\text{Occupied units} = \text{Total number of units} \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)
\]

5. **Substitute the calculated value into the formula:**

\[
\text{Occupied units} = 120 \times \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)
\]

6. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
\text{Occupied units} = 90
\]

7. **Find the number of unoccupied units:**
   - Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total number of units} - \text{Occupied units}
\]

8. **Substitute the values into the formula:**

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = 120 - 90
\]

9. **Simplify the expression:**

\[
\text{Unoccupied units} = 30
\]

**Final Answer:** The total number of unoccupied units in the building is \boxed{30}.<|im_end|>","The total number of units in the building will be 8 units/floor * 15 floors = <<8*15=120>>120 units.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate daily earnings from selling eggs**
   - First, determine how many dozens of eggs Lloyd can sell in one day.
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, divide the total number of eggs produced per day (252) by 12.
     \[
     \frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozens}
     \]
   - Next, calculate the amount Lloyd earns per day from selling these eggs at $2 per dozen.
     \[
     21 \times 2 = \$42 \text{ per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate weekly earnings**
   - Now that we know Lloyd makes $42 per day, multiply this amount by the number of days in a week (7).
     \[
     42 \times 7 = \$294 \text{ per week}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how long it takes Tom to return to his starting point, we need to calculate the time for both parts of his journey (the trip from 1 to 4 PM and the return trip).

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the trip from 1 to 4 PM
Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

- Distance traveled in one direction = 10 miles
- Speed = 10 miles/hour
- Time taken = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\)

Let \( t_1 \) be the time taken to travel from 1 to 4 PM.
\[ t_1 = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it takes Tom 1 hour to travel from 1 to 4 PM.

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the return trip
After returning, Tom needs to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM (which is a round trip).

- Distance traveled in the return trip = 10 miles (same as the first trip)
- Speed = 6 miles/hour
- Time taken = \(\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\)

Let \( t_2 \) be the time taken to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM.
\[ t_2 = \frac{10 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom approximately 1.67 hours to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM.

### Final Answer
It takes Tom approximately **1.67 hours** to travel back from 4 PM to 1 PM.<|im_end|>","He was travelling at full speed for 4-1=<<4-1=3>>3 hours

                    question:
                    Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy for him. He needs to remove 15 pounds from it. His comic books weigh 1/4 pound each and his toys ! weigh 1/2 ; pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, how many toys , does , he need to remove?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total weight reduction needed:**
   Uriah wants to reduce the weight of his book bag by 15 pounds.

2. **Calculate the current weight of the comic books:**
   - Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
   - Uriah has removed 30 comic books.
   
   \[
   \text{Weight of one comic book} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total weight of 30 comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Subtract the weight of the removed comic books from the total weight reduction needed:**
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight reduction needed} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of toy weights that can be removed based on the remaining weight reduction:**
   
   - Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of toys per pound} = \frac{\text{weight of one toy}}{\text{remaining weight reduction needed}}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of toys per pound} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{7.5} = \frac{1}{2} \div 7.5 = \frac{1}{2 \times 7.5} = \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.0667 \text{ toys per pound}
   \]

5. **Determine the total number of toys that can be removed based on the remaining weight reduction:**

   \[
   \text{Total number of toys to remove} = \text{Remaining weight reduction needed} \times \text{Number of toys per pound}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of toys to remove} = 7.5 \times 0.0667 \approx 0.5 \text{ toys}
   \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove approximately 0.5 toys to reach the desired weight reduction. However, since he cannot remove a fraction of a toy, we round up or down depending on the context (but in practical terms, removing whole toys).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Uriah needs to remove **0 toys**, because even though he can theoretically remove 0.5 toys worth of weight, in practice he would have to remove at least 1 whole toy to meet the requirement.<|im_end|>","30 comic books weigh 7.5 pounds because 30 x .25 = <<30*.25=7.5>>7.5

He needs to remove 15 toys because 7.5 / .5 = <<15=15>>15

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total earnings from both days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Day 1 (Thursday):
1. **Number of Truck Tires Repaired**: 6
2. **Number of Car Tires Repaired**: 4
3. **Earnings per Truck Tire**: $60
   - Earnings from Truck Tires: \( 6 \times 60 = \$360 \)
4. **Earnings per Car Tire**: $40
   - Earnings from Car Tires: \( 4 \times 40 = \$160 \)

5. **Total Revenue for Thursday**:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = (\text{Earnings from Truck Tires}) + (\text{Earnings from Car Tires})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \$360 + \$160 = \$520
   \]

#### Day 2 (Friday):
1. **Number of Truck Tires Repaired**: 0
2. **Number of Car Tires Repaired**: 12
3. **Earnings per Car Tire**: $40
   - Earnings from Car Tires: \( 12 \times 40 = \$480 \)

4. **Total Revenue for Friday**:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = (\text{Earnings from Truck Tires}) + (\text{Earnings from Car Tires})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \$0 + \$480 = \$480
   \]

#### Comparison:
- **Revenue on Thursday ($520)**: 
- **Revenue on Friday ($480)**: 

Since \( \$520 > \$480 \), the mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday than on Friday.

### Conclusion:
The mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday compared to Friday.

\[
\boxed{\$40}
\]<|im_end|>","On Thursday the mechanic charged a total of 6*60 + 4*40 = $<<6*60+4*40=520>>520.

- Patchy has thrice as many adopted kittens as the total number of adopted kittens.
- There are 7 adopted kittens in total (since they adopted 7 kittens).
- Therefore, Patchy has \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kittens.

Step 2: Calculate how many kittens Trixie has.
- Trixie has 12 kittens.

Step 3: Add all the kittens together.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

Step 1: Determine the total weight capacity of the bridge.
- The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the truck when it is fully loaded with boxes.
- Each box weighs 15 pounds.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of boxes that can be loaded.

Total weight of the truck = Weight of the driver + Empty truck weight + (Weight per box * Number of boxes)
\[ Total\ weight\ of\ the\ truck = 3755 + 15x \]

Step 3: Set up an inequality based on the weight capacity of the bridge.

To determine the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the additional charges, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the delivery fee**: The delivery fee is given as 25% of the original bill.
   - Original bill = $40.00
   - Delivery fee percentage = 25%
   - Delivery fee amount = $40.00 * (25/100) = $40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

2. **Add the delivery fee to the original bill**:
   - Original bill + Delivery fee = $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00

3. **Add the tip to the sum from step 2**:
   - Total after adding tip = $50.00 + $4.00 = $54.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the additional charges is $54.00.

{The final answer is} $54.00<|im_end|>","He spent $40.00 on groceries but they charged him a 25% fee so that's 40*.25 = $10.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges are in good condition based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the total number of oranges**:
   The total number of oranges is given as 25.

2. **Determine the percentage of unripe oranges**:
   We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe.

3. **Calculate the number of unripe oranges**:
   To find out how many oranges are unripe, we can calculate 20% of the total number of oranges.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 25 = 5
   \]

4. **Identify the number of sour oranges**:
   The problem states that there are exactly 2 sour oranges.

5. **Calculate the number of good oranges**:
   Since the total number of oranges is 25 and we have already accounted for the unripe (5), sour (2), and good (unknown) oranges, we can subtract these from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (\text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges})
   \]
   
   Substituting the known values:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (5 + 2) = 25 - 7 = 18
   \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of good oranges is 18.

\[

To determine how much Janet paid in total for the brooch, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the material:**
   Janet initially spends $500 on the material.
   
2. **Add the cost of the construction:**
   The jeweler constructs the brooch at an additional cost of $800.
   
3. **Calculate the insurance cost:**
   Janet pays 10% of the total cost after adding the material and construction costs as insurance. First, we find the total cost before insurance:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before insurance} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300
   \]
   Then, calculate the insurance cost:
   \[
   \text{Insurance cost} = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130

4. **Sum up all the costs:**
   Now, add the material cost, the construction cost, and the insurance cost together:
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \$500 (\text{material}) + \$800 (\text{construction}) + \$130 (\text{insurance})

                    question:
                    If Marcy works for . the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: calculating the total amount of money Marcy would receive if she worked for 40 years and then determining how much she would receive in the last 10 years.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Marcy would receive over 40 years.
If Marcy works for 40 years, she receives an annual pension of $50,000. Therefore, her total earnings over 40 years can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Annual Pension} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \$50,000 \times 40 = \$2,000,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much Marcy earns starting from the 21st year onwards.
After working for 20 years, Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of her pension each year. This means she starts receiving additional payments at that point.

First, let's calculate the value of the pension at the end of 40 years. We assume the value of the pension remains constant throughout the period.

\[
\text{Value of Pension} = \$2,000,000
\]

Next, calculate the amount she receives each year from the 21st to the 40th year using the formula for simple interest (since the percentage increase is small):

\[
\text{Annual Increase} = \text{Pension Value} \times \frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}
\]

Given that the percentage increase is 5%, we have:

\[
\text{Annual Increase} = \$2,000,000 \times \frac{5}{100} = \$100,000
\]

Now, calculate the total amount received during these 19 years:

\[
\text{Total Annual Increase Over 19 Years} = \$100,000 \times 19 = \$1,900,000
\]

Add this amount to her initial pension to get the total amount she receives from the 21st to the 40th year:

\[
\text{Total Amount from 21-40 Years} = \$2,000,000 + \$1,900,000 = \$3,900,000
\]

### Final Answer:
Marcy's annual pension at the age of 40 will be **$3,900,000**.<|im_end|>","First find how many years Marcy works after 20 years: 30 years - 20 years = <<30-20=10>>10 years

Then multiply that percentage by the total amount of the full pension to find how much she gets: $50,000 * 50% = $<<50000*50*.01=25000>>25,000

                    question:
                    Aleena subscribed to a streaming service that charges her $140 per month. If the . streaming company charged her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she ? had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of months in one year
A year has 12 months.

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly charge for the entire year
Aleena pays $140 per month. Therefore, for the full year (12 months), the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 140 \times 12 = \$1680 \]

### Step 3: Divide the year into two halves
Since the problem states that the company charges her the initial amount for the first half of the year and then charges her 10% less money on the other half of the year, we can divide the year into two equal parts.

Half of the year consists of \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the total months:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ months} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the initial charge for the first half of the year
For the first half of the year (6 months), the total charge before any reduction is:
\[ \text{Initial Charge} = 140 \times 6 = \$840 \]

### Step 5: Apply the 10% reduction to the second half of the year
The second half of the year also costs $140 per month for 6 months, but there's an additional discount. The reduced rate for the second half is:
\[ 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = \$126 \]
Therefore, the total cost for the second half of the year after applying the discount is:
\[ \text{Second Half Charge} = 126 \times 6 = \$756 \]

### Step 6: Add up both halves of the year’s charges
Now, add the charges from both halves of the year:
\[ \text{Total Charge} = \text{First Half Charge} + \text{Second Half Charge} \]
\[ \text{Total Charge} = 840 + 756 = \$1606 \]

### Final Answer:
By the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of **$1606** for the streaming service.<|im_end|>","A year has twelve months, so a half of the year is 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 months,

For the next half of the year, the streaming service company charged her 10/100*140 = $<<10/100*140=14>>14 less
She paid $140-$14 = $<<140-14=126>>126 each month for the remaining half of the year,
In total, she paid 126*6 = $<<126*6=756>>756 for the other half of the year for the streaming service.

How many miles can Sophia drive on a single tank of gas?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Sophia has driven so far:**
   Sophia has already driven 100 miles.

2. **Determine the remaining capacity of the gas tank:**
   The total capacity of the gas tank is 12 gallons.
   
3. **Calculate the number of full tanks Sophia needs to refill her current tank to reach its full capacity:**
   Since Sophia has already filled the tank once (with 4 gallons), she still needs to fill it one more time to reach its full capacity.
   
4. **Calculate the amount of gas left after refilling:**
   After adding another 4 gallons, Sophia will have \(4 \text{ gallons} + 4 \text{ gallons} = 8 \text{ gallons}\) left in the tank.
   
5. **Calculate the total distance Sophia can drive on this new full tank:**
   With 8 gallons of gas left, Sophia can drive \(8 \text{ gallons} \times x \text{ miles per gallon}\).

Now let's perform the calculations:

1. Distance already driven: \(100\) miles
2. Remaining capacity: \(12 - 4 = 8 \text{ gallons}\)
3. Full tank calculation: 
   Sophia needs to add 4 gallons to reach her full capacity, which means the remaining capacity is 8 gallons.
4. Total distance possible on 8 gallons:
   Since her car travels at a constant rate, if she drives 100 miles on 4 gallons, then driving 8 gallons will give her \(8/4 = 2\) times the distance.
   
Therefore, Sophia can drive \(100 \times 2 = 200\) miles on a full tank of gas.

**Final Answer:** Sophia can drive **200 miles** on a single tank of gas.<|im_end|>","To find miles per gallon divide 100 miles / 4 gallons = <<100/4=25>>25 miles per gallon

1. Calculate the time Jim spends reading.
2. Determine the total time spent on both activities per session.
3. Multiply that by the number of sessions per week.
4. Finally, multiply that by the number of weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the time Jim spends reading.
- Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV.
- Since he watches TV for 2 hours, he reads for \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

Step 2: Determine the total time spent on both activities per session.
- Time spent watching TV + Time spent reading = \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) hours.

Step 3: Multiply that by the number of sessions per week.
- He does this 3 times a week, so the weekly total is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours.

Step 4: Finally, multiply that by the number of weeks.

<|im_start|>user
To determine the total number of people who have all of the schools sent to the basketball tournament, let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of Schools**: There are four schools.
2. **Teams per School**:
   - Each school sends one girls' basketball team and one boys' basketball team.
   - Each team consists of 5 players.
3. **Coaches per Team**:
   - Each school sends one coach for both the girls' and boys' teams.

Now, let's calculate the total number of people:

- **Players in Girls' Teams**: 
  - Each school has 1 girls' team.
  - Each team has 5 players.
  - Therefore, each school contributes \(5\) players.
  - Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players from girls' teams is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

- **Players in Boys' Teams**:
  - Similarly, each school has 1 boys' team.
  - Each team has 5 players.
  - Therefore, each school contributes \(5\) players.
  - Since there are 4 schools, the total number of players from boys' teams is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

- **Total Players from All Teams**:
  - The total number of players across all teams (both girls' and boys') is \(20 + 20 = 40\).

- **Total Coaches**:
  - Each school has 1 coach for both teams.
  - Since there are 4 schools, the total number of coaches is \(4 \times 1 = 4\).

Finally, we sum up all these elements to get the total number of people involved:

- Total People: Players + Coaches = \(40 + 4 = 44\).

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 44.<|im_end|>","Each school has sent 1 girls’ basketball team + 1 boys’ basketball team = <<1+1=2>>2 teams.

<|im_start|>user

To determine the total number of gems in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of rubies:**
   - The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
   - Number of diamonds = 175
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of rubies.
   - According to the information, \( R = 175 - 35 \).

2. **Subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:**
   \[
   R = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emeralds:**
   - The problem also mentions that there are twice as many emeralds as rubies.
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of emeralds.
   - According to the information, \( E = 2R \).

4. **Substitute the value of rubies into the equation for emeralds:**
   \[
   E = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

5. **Sum up all the gems:**
   - Number of diamonds = 175

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know that there are twice as many boys as girls.
   - Number of girls = 60.
   - Therefore, number of boys = 2 × (number of girls) = 2 × 60 = 120.

2. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Total students = number of boys + number of girls = 120 + 60 = 180.

3. **Use the given ratio of students to teachers to find the number of teachers:**
   - The ratio of students to teachers is 5:1.
   - This means for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher.
   - To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by this ratio.

4. **Perform the division to find the number of teachers:**
   - Number of teachers = total number of students / ratio = 180 / 5 = 36.

Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36. 

{The final answer is} 36.<|im_end|>","There are twice as many boys as girls, so if there are 60 girls, there are 2*60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Bailey started with based on her total earnings over 8 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Bailey received as an allowance.
Bailey's weekly allowance is $5, and she receives it for 8 weeks. Therefore, her total allowance can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Allowance} = \text{Weekly Allowance} \times \text{Number of Weeks}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total Allowance} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

So, Bailey received a total of $40 in allowances.

Step 2: Determine how much more money Bailey needed to reach her total amount after receiving her allowance.

At the end of the 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. We already know that she received $40 from her allowance. So, the additional money she needs to reach her goal is:

\[
\text{Additional Money Needed} = \text{Total Amount After Allowances} - \text{Total Allowance}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Additional Money Needed} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

Therefore, Bailey must have started with $60.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches in one week:**

   - Judy teaches 5 classes/day for every weekday.
   - There are typically 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) in a typical workweek.

   Therefore, the number of classes Judy teaches daily over the weekdays = \(5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/weekday}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of classes Judy teaches on Saturdays:**
   
   - Judy also teaches 8 classes on Saturday.

3. **Sum up the total number of classes Judy teaches in one week:**

   \[
   \text{Total classes per week} = (\text{classes/day} \times \text{days per week}) + \text{classes on Saturday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total classes per week} = (5 \times 5) + 8 = 25 + 8 = 33
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students Judy teaches in one week:**

   - Each class has 15 students.

   Therefore, the total number of students in one week = \(33 \text{ classes/week} \times 15 \text{ students/class}\).

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Judy makes from teaching these students:**

   - She charges $15 per student.

   Therefore, her total earnings per week = \(33 \text{ classes/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/student}\).

6. **Perform the multiplication to find out the total earnings:**

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of baked good separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling brownies**

- Number of brownies sold: 43
- Price per brownie: $3

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = \text{Number of brownies} \times \text{Price per brownie}
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = \$129
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes**

- Number of cheesecakes sold: 23
- Price per cheesecake: $4

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = \text{Number of cheesecakes} \times \text{Price per cheesecake}
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = \$92

**Step 3: Sum the revenues from both types of baked goods**

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from brownies} + \text{Revenue from cheesecakes}
\]

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = \$221

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost including the interest and then determine how much Shiela will pay monthly over three months.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before interest
Shiela buys five cell phones at $150 each.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of interest
A 2% interest rate applies to the total cost.
\[ \text{Interest Amount} = 2\% \times \$750 \]
\[ \text{Interest Amount} = 0.02 \times \$750 \]
\[ \text{Interest Amount} = \$15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount Shiela needs to pay
Add the total cost and the interest amount.
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765 \]

### Step 4: Determine the monthly payment over 3 months
Divide the total amount by 3 (since she pays it over 3 months).
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \$255 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, Shiela will pay $\boxed{255}$ each month for 3 months.<|im_end|>","A $150 x 2/100 = $<<150*2/100=3>>3 interest will be charged for each unit.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Artie will make from selling these flowers after rounding the prices to the nearest dollar, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue without rounding
First, let's calculate the total revenue if the prices were not rounded:

- Marigolds: \( 12 \text{ pots} \times \$2.74 \text{ per pot} = \$32.88 \)
- Petunias: \( 9 \text{ pots} \times \$1.87 \text{ per pot} = \$16.83 \)
- Begonias: \( 17 \text{ pots} \times \$2.12 \text{ per pot} = \$35.74 \)

Adding these amounts together gives us the total revenue before rounding:

\[
\$32.88 + \$16.83 + \$35.74 = \$85.45
\]

### Step 2: Round the prices to the nearest dollar
Next, we'll round each price to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: The prices are already given as whole numbers (\$2.74), which means they do not require rounding.
- Petunias: \( \$1.87 \) rounds down to \( \$1.00 \).
- Begonias: \( \$2.12 \) rounds up to \( \$3.00 \).

After rounding, the new prices are:

- Marigolds: \$2.74 (no change in value due to rounding)
- Petunias: \$1.00
- Begonias: \$3.00

### Step 3: Recalculate the total revenue with rounded prices
Now that we have the rounded prices, we can recalculate the total revenue:

- Marigolds: \( 12 \text{ pots} \times \$2.74 \text{ per pot} = \$32.88 \)
- Petunias: \( 9 \text{ pots} \times \$1.00 \text{ per pot} = \$9.00 \)
- Begonias: \( 17 \text{ pots} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pot} = \$51.00 \)

Adding these amounts together gives us the total revenue after rounding:

\[
\$32.88 + \$9.00 + \$51.00 = \$92.88
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, after rounding the prices to the nearest dollar, Artie will make **\$92.88** from selling these flowers.<|im_end|>","Artie will round his marigolds up from $2.74 to $3, since the number following the 2 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his petunias up from $1.87 to $2, since the number following the 1 is 5 or higher.
Artie will round his begonias down from $2.12 to $2, since the number following the 2 is less than 5.
Artie sells 12 marigolds x $3 = $<<12*3=36>>36
Artie sells 9 petunias x $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Number of levels**: There are 4 levels in total.
2. **Square footage of the top level**: The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.

Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can determine the square footage for each level starting from the bottom to the top.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Level 3:
- Level 4 has 16 square feet.
- Level 3 must be half of Level 4: \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.

#### Level 2:
- Level 3 has 8 square feet.
- Level 2 must be half of Level 3: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.

#### Level 1:
- Level 2 has 4 square feet.
- Level 1 must be half of Level 2: \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.

#### Level 0 (the base):
- Level 1 has 2 square feet.
- Since there is only one level, the base is already calculated.

Now, let's sum up all the levels to find the total square footage:

- Level 4: 16 sq ft
- Level 3: 8 sq ft
- Level 2: 4 sq ft
- Level 1: 2 sq ft
- Level 0: 2 sq ft

Adding these together gives us the total square footage:
\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 32 \]

So, the total square footage of all levels combined is 32 square feet.

### Average Square Footage per Level:
To find the average, divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Square Footage}}{\text{Number of Levels}} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ \text{Average} = 8 \]

Therefore, the average square footage per level is **8** square feet.<|im_end|>","Level 3 is 32 square feet because 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the feeding schedule into two parts: the initial period and the remainder of the time.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total amount of dog food needed during the first 180 days.
- The puppy eats 1 cup per day for the first 180 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for these 180 days is \(1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days}\).

\[ 
\text{Total food for the first 180 days} = 1 \times 180 = 180 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 2:** Determine the number of days remaining after the first 180 days.
- There are 365 days in a year (assuming it's not a leap year).
- Subtracting the 180 days already accounted for from the total gives us:

\[ 
365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days remaining}
\]

**Step 3:** Calculate the total amount of dog food needed during the remaining 185 days.
- The puppy then eats 2 cups per day for the next 185 days.
- Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for these 185 days is \(2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days}\).

\[ 
\text{Total food for the remaining 185 days} = 2 \times 185 = 370 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 4:** Add the amounts of dog food needed for both periods together.
- Adding the amounts calculated in steps 1 and 2 gives us the total amount of dog food needed over the entire year.

\[ 
\text{Total food needed for the year} = 180 + 370 = 550 \text{ cups}
\]

**Step 5:** Determine the number of bags of dog food required.
- Each bag contains 110 cups of dog food.
- To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total amount of dog food by the capacity of one bag.

\[ 
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{550}{110} = 5 \text{ bags}
\]

Therefore, Cecilia will use **5 bags of dog food** in the first year.<|im_end|>","The number of cups of dog food given for the first 180 days is 180 * 1 = <<180*1=180>>180 cups

                    If Raymond . does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, ? calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much laundry each person does based on the given relationships and then find the difference between their amounts.

1. **Determine the amount of laundry Sarah does:**
   - We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Calculate the amount of laundry David does:**
   - According to the information provided, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
     \[
     \text{Amount of laundry Sarah does} = 4 \times \text{Amount of laundry David does}
     \]
   - Substitute the known value for Sarah's laundry into the equation:
     \[
     400 = 4 \times \text{Amount of laundry David does}
     \]
   - Solve for the Amount of laundry David does:
     \[
     \text{Amount of laundry David does} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does:**
   - Raymon does half as much laundry as Sarah.
     \[
     \text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Amount of laundry Sarah does}
     \]
   - Substitute the value for Sarah's laundry into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Find the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David:**
   - Subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Amount of laundry Raymond does} - \text{Amount of laundry David does}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

**Final Answer:** The difference in the amount of laundry that Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.<|im_end|>","If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does 1/2*400 = 200 pounds of laundry.
Sara also does 4 times as much laundry as David, meaning David does 400/4 = <<400/4=100>>100 pounds of laundry.
The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200-100 = <<200-100=100>>100 pounds

                    question:
                    Vincent can buy flowers in , packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying : 18 flowers ? at the better price?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better option to purchase 18 flowers, we need to calculate the cost for both package options and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of packages needed for each option.
- **Option A (packages of 3 for $2.50):**
  - To find out how many packages of 3 flowers Vincent needs, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per package:
    \[
    \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
    \]
  - The cost for this option would be:
    \[
    \text{Total cost} = 6 \times \$2.50 = \$15.00
    \]

- **Option B (packages of 2 for $1):**
  - Similarly, to find out how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs, divide the total number of flowers by the number of flowers per package:
    \[
    \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
    \]
  - The cost for this option would be:
    \[
    \text{Total cost} = 9 \times \$1 = \$9.00
    \]

### Step 2: Compare the costs from Option A and Option B.
- **Costs comparison:**
  - Cost of Option A ($15.00)
  - Cost of Option B ($9.00)

Since $9.00 < $15.00, Option B is cheaper.

### Step 3: Determine the savings.
- Savings = Cost of Option A - Cost of Option B
\[
\text{Savings} = \$15.00 - \$9.00 = \$6.00
\]

### Conclusion:
Vincent saves $\boxed{6.00}$ by buying 18 flowers using the best deal (package of 2).<|im_end|>","Find how many packages of 3 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6.

Find how many packages of 2 would be needed which is 18 ÷ 2 = <<18/2=9>>9.
The cost of using packages of 2 is 9 × $1 = $<<9*1=9>>9.
Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $<<15-9=6>>6.

To determine the total cost of grooming after applying the discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The original price of grooming is $100.
   - The discount offered is 30%.

   To find the discount amount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage (expressed as a decimal):

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \$100 \times 0.30 = \$30
   \]

2. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \$100 - \$30 = \$70
   \]

So, the total cost of grooming after applying the discount is $\boxed{\$70}$.<|im_end|>","The groomer gave a 100*.3=$<<100*.3=30>>30 discount

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how much water each girl received.
Each girl gets 1/6 of the total amount of water.

Total water = 24 liters

Amount each girl receives = 1/6 * 24 liters = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, together they receive:
4 liters (first girl) + 4 liters (second girl) = 8 liters

Step 2: Subtract the amount of water given to the girls from the initial total.
Initial total water = 24 liters

Water given to girls = 8 liters

Remaining water after giving to girls = 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters

Step 3: Add the amount of water the boy received.
Boy received 6 liters more than what was initially calculated for the girls.

Therefore, the total amount of water given to everyone is:
8 liters (girls) + 6 liters (boy) = 14 liters

Step 4: Calculate the remaining water.
Remaining water = Initial total water - Total water given away

Remaining water = 24 liters - 14 liters = 10 liters

Final Answer:
The number of liters of water that were left is 10.<|im_end|>","Each of the girls got 24 x 1/6 = <<24*1/6=4>>4 liters of water.

- Total stickers after buying = 10 + 21 = **31** stickers.

### Step 3: Getting Stickers For His Birthday
Charlie receives an additional 23 stickers as a gift.
- Total stickers now = 31 + 23 = **54** stickers.

### Step 4: Giving Some Stickers Away
Charlie gives away 9 stickers to his sister.
- Total stickers remaining = 54 - 9 = **45** stickers.

### Step 5: Using Stickers for Decoration
Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.
- Total stickers remaining = 45 - 28 = **17** stickers.

Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is \boxed{17}.<|im_end|>","The total number of stickers is 10 + 21 + 23 = <<10+21+23=54>>54.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate how much Alex weighs.
- We know that Alex's weight is represented as \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 4 times Grace's weight.
- First, let's calculate 4 times Grace's weight.
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \]
- Now, we find out how much 2/3 of 500 is.
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 500 = \frac{1000}{3} \approx 333.33 \]

So, Alex weighs approximately 333.33 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate their combined weights.
- To find the total combined weight, add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together.
\[ 125 + 333.33 = 458.33 \]

Therefore, their combined weights are approximately 458.33 pounds.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many wins the football team had given that they won 8 more games than they lost.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( W \) represent the number of wins.
   Let \( L \) represent the number of losses.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   We know from the problem statement that:
   - The total number of games played is 22.
   - The team won 8 more games than they lost.
   
   This gives us two equations based on these facts:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

3. **Solve for One Variable in Terms of the Other:**
   From the second equation, express \( W \) in terms of \( L \):
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

4. **Substitute into the Total Games Equation:**
   Substitute \( W = L + 8 \) into the first equation:
   \[
   (L + 8) + L = 22
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2L + 8 = 22
   \]

5. **Isolate the Variable Term:**
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   2L = 14
   \]

6. **Solve for \( L \):**
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   L = 7
   \]

7. **Find the Number of Wins (\( W \)):**
   Substitute \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
   \[
   W = 7 + 8
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   W = 15
   \]

Therefore, the number of wins is \( \boxed{15} \).<|im_end|>","Let L be the number of losses.
The number of wins is L + <<+8=8>>8.
The team played (L+8) + L = 2L + 8 = 22 games.

So L = 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 losses.
Therefore, the team won 22 – 7 = <<22-7=15>>15 games.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of vacations:**
   - Gene goes on four vacations a year.

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations over his lifetime:**
   - Since Gene started going on vacations at age 23 and continues to go until now (age 34), we need to find out how many years he has spent on vacations.
   - The difference between his current age and the starting age gives us the number of years he has been on vacations.
     \[
     \text{Number of years} = 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Therefore, he has been on four vacations per year for 11 years.
     \[
     \text{Total number of vacations} = 4 \times 11 = 44 \text{ vacations}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of quilt blocks per vacation:**
   - Each vacation consists of different-year blocks, meaning there are as many blocks as there are years of his life during that vacation.
   - For example, if he went on his first vacation when he was 23, he would use blocks corresponding to years 2001-2005 (assuming these are the only available vintage t-shirt years).
   - If he went on his second vacation when he was 24, he would use blocks corresponding to years 2006-2010, and so on.

4. **Calculate the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - To find the total number of quilt blocks, multiply the number of years of each vacation by the number of years he has gone on vacations.
   - Let’s assume he had 4 different years of vacations (for simplicity):
     - First vacation (23 years old): Blocks from 2001-2005 (5 years)
     - Second vacation (24 years old): Blocks from 2006-2010 (5 years)
     - Third vacation (25 years old): Blocks from 2011-2015 (5 years)
     - Fourth vacation (26 years old): Blocks from 2016-2020 (5 years)

     \[
     \text{Total number of blocks} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ blocks per vacation}
     \]

5. **Sum up all the blocks across all vacations:**
   - Multiply the number of blocks per vacation by the total number of vacations.
     \[
     \text{Total number of blocks} = 20 \times 44 = 880 \text{ blocks}
     \]

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 880 quilt blocks.<|im_end|>","Gene has been on 34 - 23 = <<34-23=11>>11 years of vacations, so he has 11 rows of blocks.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the current annual salary.
Given that the company pays each employee $600 per month, we first calculate the total monthly salary.

\[ \text{Total Monthly Salary} = \$600 \]

Next, we convert this into an annual salary assuming there are approximately 30 days in a month (which gives us about 90 days in a month):

\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$600 \times 30 \]
\[ \text{Annual Salary} = \$18,000 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the increase in salary due to the company's policy.
According to the company's policy, if an employee stays at least 5 years, their salary increases by 10% annually based on their initial salary. Since Sylvie has been working for 5 years, she qualifies for this increased salary.

The formula to calculate the new salary after a given number of years of service can be represented as follows:

\[ \text{New Salary} = \text{Initial Salary} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}} \]

Here, the initial salary is $18,000, the increase rate is 10%, or 0.10, and the number of years is 5.

### Step 3: Apply the calculation.
Now, substitute the values into the formula:

\[ \text{New Salary} = \$18,000 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = \$18,000 \times (1.10)^5 \]

We now calculate \( (1.10)^5 \):

\[ (1.10)^5 \approx 1.61051 \]

So,

\[ \text{New Salary} = \$18,000 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{New Salary} \approx \$28,989.18 \]

Therefore, Sylvie’s annual salary after three more years of service will be approximately **$28,989.18**.<|im_end|>","In a month, Sylvie earns $600. which totals $600/month * 12 months/year = $7200 in a year.
Sylvie earnings will increase by 10/100 * $7200/year = $<<10/100*7200=720>>720/year after 5 years.
In three years, the total increase in her salary will be 3 years * $720/year = $<<3*720=2160>>2160
After three years, Sylvie will be paid $7200 + $2160 = $<<7200+2160=9360>>9360

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many copies Harald sold based on the information provided about Marilyn's sales.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.
   - Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald’s, let \( M \) be the number of copies that Marilyn sold. Therefore, \( M = 10H \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, together they sold 88,000 copies. So, the total sales can be represented as:
     \[
     M + H = 88,000
     \]

     \[
     11H = 88,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( H \):**
   - Divide both sides by 11 to isolate \( H \):
     \[
     H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Harald sold 8,000 copies.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{Harald sold 8,000 copies}}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags for her birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who will attend.
Christina invited 16 friends. According to the problem, 1/4 of the attendees do not show up.

\[
\text{Number of guests who do not show up} = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
\]

So, the number of guests who will attend is:

\[
\text{Number of guests who will attend} = 16 - 4 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of gift bags needed.
Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest.

\[
\text{Total number of gift bags needed} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of one gift bag.
Each gift bag costs $2.

\[
\text{Cost of one gift bag} = \$2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all gift bags.
Multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per gift bag.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9 \times \$2 = \$18

To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs for his picnic, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for adults.
2. Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for children.
3. Sum both amounts to find the total required.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Step 1: Calculate the potato salad needed for adults
Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[ \text{Total for adults} = 20 \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the potato salad needed for children
Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[ \text{Total for children} = 5 \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

#### Step 3: Sum both amounts to find the total required
Now, add the totals from adults and children together.

\[ \text{Total required} = 200 \text{ lbs (adults)} + 25 \text{ lbs (children)} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring **225 pounds** of potato salad to the picnic to ensure everyone has enough to eat.<|im_end|>","Half of 10 pounds is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 pounds.

To feed 5 dinosaur children, he will need 5*5=<<5*5=25>>25 pounds of potato salad.
In total, he will need to bring 200+25=<<200+25=225>>225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pets Marcia has.
2. Use the information about Marcia's pets to find out how many pets Jan has.
3. Add up all the pets (Marcia's, Jan's, and Cindy's) to get the total.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many pets Marcia has
- We know that Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
- Therefore, Marcia has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pets.

### Step 2: Determine how many pets Jan has
- Jan has three times the number of pets Marcia has.
- Since Marcia has 6 pets, Jan has \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) pets.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets
- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 6 pets.
- Jan has 18 pets.
- The total number of pets is \( 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \).

Therefore, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together is **28**.<|im_end|>","Marcia has 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 pets.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all five children based on the given relationships between their ages.

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows:
- \( A \) for Amy,
- \( J \) for Jackson,
- \( C \) for Corey,
- \( I \) for James (given as 10),
- \( Y \) for Corey (since James is 1 year younger than Corey).

From the information provided:
1. **James** is 10.
   - Given: \( I = 10 \)

2. **James is 1 year younger than Corey**.
   - Therefore, \( C = I + 1 \).
   - Substituting \( I = 10 \):
     \[
     C = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Amy is 5 years older than Jackson**.
   - Let \( J \) be Jackson’s age.
   - Therefore, \( A = J + 5 \).

4. **Corey is 2 years younger than Amy**.
   - Since \( C = 11 \), Amy must be at least 13 years old.
   - Therefore, \( A = C + 2 \).
   - Substituting \( C = 11 \):
     \[
     A = 11 + 2 = 13
     \]

Now that we know Amy is 13 years old, let's find Jackson's age using the relationship between Amy and Jackson:
\[
A = J + 5
\]
Substitute \( A = 13 \):
\[
13 = J + 5

Solving for \( J \):
\[
J = 13 - 5 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]<|im_end|>","James is 10 and 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = <<10+1=11>>11 years old

                    question:
                    Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles.  But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%.  , If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles, in seconds?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original difference between Lee's and Gerald's times.
- Lee was originally 2 seconds faster than Gerald.

Let's denote Gerald's original time as \( G \) seconds. Then, Lee's original time would be \( G - 2 \) seconds.

Given that Lee now takes 38 seconds, we can set up the equation:
\[ G - 2 = 38 \]

Solving for \( G \):
\[ G = 38 + 2 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

So, Gerald originally took 40 seconds to run the 400 meters.

### Step 2: Calculate the improvement in Gerald's speed due to his new diet.
Gerald's speed increased by 10%, so he now runs at 110% of his original speed.

Let \( V \) be Gerald’s original speed (in terms of distance per second). His new speed will then be:
\[ V_{\text{new}} = 1.1V \]

### Step 3: Find the relationship between their speeds before and after the diet change.
We know that Lee’s current time (38 seconds) corresponds to a different distance but the same relative speed compared to Gerald’s initial time.

Since they ran the same distance (400 meters), we can use their respective speeds to find out how far each has run.

For Lee:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Lee}} = \frac{38}{L} \]
where \( L \) is Lee's running speed.

For Gerald:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Gerald}} = \frac{40}{G} \]
where \( G \) is Gerald's original speed.

Since both distances are equal (400 meters), we have:
\[ \frac{38}{L} = \frac{40}{G} \]

Substitute \( L \) from Step 1 into this equation:
\[ \frac{38}{L} = \frac{40}{G} \]
\[ \frac{38}{G - 2} = \frac{40}{G} \]

Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions:
\[ 38G = 40(G - 2) \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 38G = 40G - 80 \]

Rearrange to isolate \( G \):
\[ 38G - 40G = -80 \]
\[ -2G = -80 \]
\[ G = 40 \]

This confirms our previous calculation where \( G = 40 \).

### Step 4: Calculate Gerald's new speed after the diet.
Since Gerald's original speed \( G \) is 40 seconds for 400 meters, his new speed with the improved diet is:
\[ V_{\text{new}} = 1.1G \]
\[ V_{\text{new}} = 1.1 \times 40 \]
\[ V_{\text{new}} = 44 \]

Thus, Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdle in **44** seconds.<|im_end|>","If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which was two seconds faster than Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles, then Gerald initially would run the 400-meter hurdles in 38+2=<<38+2=40>>40 seconds.
10% of 40 seconds is 40*0.1=<<40*0.1=4>>4 seconds.
The improved diet reduced Gerald's race time to 40-4=<<40-4=36>>36 seconds.

   Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
   Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
   Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

2. **Given Information:**
   - There are two cats for every dog. This means \( C = 2D \).
   - The number of dogs (\( D \)) is given as 60.
   
3. **Calculate Number of Cats:**
   Since \( C = 2D \), we substitute \( D \) (which is 60) into the equation:
   \[
   C = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]
   So, there are 120 cats.

4. **Total Number of Dogs and Cats:**
   Now, we add the number of dogs and cats together to find out how many pets are accounted for so far:
   \[
   P_{DC} = D + C = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

5. **Number of Rabbits:**
   According to the problem, the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. We already calculated that the combined number of dogs and cats is 180, so:
   \[
   R = P_{DC} - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
   \]

6. **Final Total Number of Pets:**
   Finally, we sum up all the pets in the neighborhood:

                    question:
                    When Freda cooks canned tomatoes ; into sauce, they lose half their volume. Each : 16 ; ounce can of tomatoes that she uses contains three tomatoes. Freda’s last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce. How ? many tomatoes did Freda ; use?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total volume of tomatoes used:**
   - Freda makes 32 ounces of sauce.
   - The tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked.
   
   Let \( V \) be the initial volume of tomatoes in the can before cooking.

   Since the tomatoes lose half their volume, we have:
   \[
   \frac{V}{2} = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]

   Solving for \( V \):
   \[
   V = 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]
   So, the initial volume of tomatoes was 64 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of cans used:**
   - Each can contains 16 ounces of tomatoes.
   - Freda uses 3 cans to make 32 ounces of sauce.

3. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.
   - Therefore, each can contributes 3 tomatoes.
   - Freda uses 3 cans, so the total number of tomatoes is:
   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

So, Freda uses 9 tomatoes in her last batch of tomato sauce. 

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","Tomatoes lose half their volume when made into sauce, so Freda started with 32 * 2 = <<32*2=64>>64 ounces of tomatoes.
At 16 ounces per can, she used 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 cans of tomatoes.
At 3 tomatoes a can, Freda used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 tomatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cars that initially entered the traffic jam.
Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cars that exited after driving through the traffic jam.
According to the information given, 5 cars took an exit. Therefore, we need to subtract these 5 cars from the initial total:
\[ \text{Cars exiting} = 5 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the cars that exited from the initial count.
Subtracting the 5 cars that exited from the initial 30 cars gives us:
\[ \text{Remaining cars before entry} = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
We know that 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes. This means:
\[ \text{Total cars driven through in 15 minutes} = 20 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
Since the total number of cars that drove through in 15 minutes is 20, and we already accounted for 25 cars (initially), the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is:
\[ \text{Cars driven through in first 15 minutes} = 20 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]<|im_end|>","The cars that exited do not need to be included so there were 30 original cars – 5 cars that exited = <<30-5=25>>25 cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Most of the cars exited in the final 15 minutes so in the first 15 minutes, there must have been 25 total cars – 20 cars that drove through in the final 15 minutes = 5 cars that drove through the traffic jam.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants initially:**
   - Mary receives 18 new potted plants.
   - She also has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.

   Total initial potted plants = (potted plants per ledge * number of ledges) + received potted plants
   
   \[ 2 \times 40 + 18 = 80 + 18 = 98 \]

2. **Determine how many potted plants she gives away:**
   - Mary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges.

   Number of potted plants given away = 1 × 40 = 40

3. **Calculate the remaining number of potted plants after giving some away:**

   Remaining potted plants = Initial total potted plants - Potted plants given away
   
   \[ 98 - 40 = 58 \]

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants. 

{The final answer is} 58 potted plants.<|im_end|>","Yesterday, before receiving the plants, Mary had 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants

Tomorrow, Mary’s plant giveaway will be 40 *1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.
She will therefore remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of doorbells that each friend pressed and then sum them up.

1. **First Friend:**
   - The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.
   
2. **Second Friend:**
   - The second friend pressed on the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     20 + \left( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \right)
     \]
     Simplifying inside the parentheses:
     \[
     20 + (5)
     \]
     Adding these together:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Third Friend:**
   - The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
   - We know the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     60 + 10
     \]
     Adding these together:
     \[
     60 + 10 = 70
     \]

4. **Fourth Friend:**
   - The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.

Now, let’s add up all the numbers from each friend:

\[
20 (\text{first friend}) + 25 (\text{second friend}) + 70 (\text{third friend}) + 60 (\text{fourth friend})
\]

Summing these values:

\[

To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break down his drinking habits:

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - He has one glass of water at breakfast.
   - One glass of water for lunch.
   - One glass of water for dinner.

   Total glasses per day = 3 glasses

   Since there are 5 weekdays in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total glasses in a week} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ glasses}
   \]

2. **Weekends:**
   - On the weekend, he has one glass of water for breakfast.
   - One glass of water for lunch.
   - One glass of water for dinner.

   Total glasses per day on weekends = 3 glasses

   There are 2 days in the weekend:
   \[
   \text{Total glasses in the weekend} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ glasses}
   \]

Now, we add up the total number of glasses from both weekdays and weekends:

- The city spans 42 miles.
- The fog bank covers 3 miles per minute.

**Step 2: Calculate the time required to cover the entire city**
- To find out how many minutes it takes to cover 42 miles at a rate of 3 miles per minute, we divide the total distance by the coverage rate.

\[ \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Coverage Rate}} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/minute}} \]

Perform the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{42}{3} = 14 \text{ minutes} \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pieces Poppy places initially:**
   - Poppy places a quarter of the total pieces.
   - The total number of pieces is 1000.
   - Therefore, the number of pieces Poppy places is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \).

2. **Calculate the remaining pieces after Poppy places hers:**
   - After Poppy places 250 pieces, the remaining pieces are \( 1000 - 250 = 750 \).

3. **Determine how many pieces Poppy's mom places:**
   - Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.
   - The remaining pieces (after Poppy) are 750.

                    question:
                    John has 3 boxes.  Each box is 5 , inches , by 6 inches by 4 inches.  The walls are 1 inch thick.  ! What is the total inner volume of all 3 boxes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the total inner volume of all three boxes after accounting for the wall thickness, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the outer dimensions of one box:**
   - Outer length (L_outer) = 5 inches + 2(1 inch) = 7 inches
   - Outer width (W_outer) = 6 inches + 2(1 inch) = 8 inches
   - Outer height (H_outer) = 4 inches + 2(1 inch) = 6 inches

2. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - Inner length (L_inner) = L_outer - 2(1 inch) = 5 inches
   - Inner width (W_inner) = W_outer - 2(1 inch) = 4 inches
   - Inner height (H_inner) = H_outer - 2(1 inch) = 2 inches

3. **Calculate the volume of one box:**
   \[
   V_{\text{one box}} = L_{\text{inner}} \times W_{\text{inner}} \times H_{\text{inner}}
   \]
   Substituting in our values:
   \[
   V_{\text{one box}} = 5 \times 4 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total volume of all three boxes without considering the overlap between them:**
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times V_{\text{one box}} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

5. **Account for the overlapping space at the corners where two boxes meet:**
   - Since each corner box overlaps with another box's top or bottom face, we need to subtract the volume of this overlap.
   - There are 4 such corners (each box has a 1-inch-thick wall on both sides), so there are 4 overlapping volumes that need to be subtracted.

   Let’s calculate the volume of one corner box:
   - Corner length (L_corner) = 6 inches - 2(1 inch) = 4 inches
   - Corner width (W_corner) = 6 inches - 2(1 inch) = 4 inches
   - Corner height (H_corner) = 4 inches - 2(1 inch) = 2 inches

   Volume of one corner box:
   \[
   V_{\text{corner box}} = L_{\text{corner}} \times W_{\text{corner}} \times H_{\text{corner}}
   \]
   Substituting in our values:
   \[
   V_{\text{corner box}} = 4 \times 4 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

   Total volume of all four corner boxes:
   \[
   V_{\text{total overlap}} = 4 \times V_{\text{corner box}} = 4 \times 32 = 128 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

6. **Subtract the overlapping volume from the total volume calculated earlier:**
   \[
   V_{\text{final}} = V_{\text{total}} - V_{\text{total overlap}}
   \]
   Substituting in our values:
   \[
   V_{\text{final}} = 120 - 128 = -8 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The walls subtract 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 inches from each dimension
So each box has 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 inch width
It also has a 6-2=<<6-2=4>>4 inch height
Finally, it has a 4-2=<<4-2=2>>2 inch depth
So the inner volume of one box is 4*3*2=<<4*3*2=24>>24 cubic inches

                    question:
                    Frankie watches TV after he ; finishes his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched . a 1-hour episode of his favorite show ? each night. On Wednesday, he watched a . few : episodes of a 30-minute show. On . Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode , and a 30-minute show.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday based on the total time spent watching TV.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours Frankie watched TV:**
   - Total hours = 7 hours

2. **Determine the number of hours Frank watched on other days:**
   - Monday + Tuesday = 1 hour per day * 2 days = 2 hours
   - Wednesday = 1 hour (episodes) + 30 minutes (show) = 1.5 hours
   - Thursday = 1 hour (episode) + 30 minutes (show) = 1.5 hours
   - Friday = 2 hours (episodes)

3. **Sum up the hours from these days:**
   - Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday = 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

4. **Subtract the hours already accounted for from the total hours:**
   - Total hours = 7 hours
   - Hours already accounted for = 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Since the sum matches the total hours watched, it confirms that the calculation is correct.

### Conclusion:

Frankie watched 30-minute episodes on Wednesday. To find out exactly how many episodes, let's denote \( x \) as the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

Given:
- Each 30-minute episode equals 0.5 hours.
- The total time spent on Wednesday = 1.5 hours.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.5x = 1.5 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday is **3**.<|im_end|>","Let W be the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday.
After Monday, he had 7 - 1 = <<7-1=6>>6 hours of TV left.
After Tuesday, he had 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours of TV left.
After Thursday, he had 5 - 1 - 1/2 = 3 1/2 hours of TV left.
After Friday, he had 3 1/2 - 2 = 1 1/2 hours of TV left.
Each 30-minute episode is 1/2 hour.
Thus, W = 1 1/2 / 1/2 = 3 episodes.

                    question:
                    Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as he . did last year. When he finishes baking, he realizes he actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. He , drops 5 of his cookies as he ? is putting them out to cool, and now : has ! a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many cookies Henry intended to bake**

Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry intended to bake.

According to the information given:
- Henry made twice as many cookies as last year.
- Henry actually made 15 more cookies than intended.

So, if he intended to bake \( x \) cookies, he ended up baking \( 2x + 15 \).

We know that after dropping some cookies, he had 110 cookies in total.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Here, 5 cookies were dropped because they didn't cool properly.

**Step 2: Solve the equation for \( x \)**

Now, let's simplify the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 100 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 50 \]

This means Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year.

**Step 3: Verify the solution**

If Henry intended to bake 50 cookies, then he made:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ cookies} \]

After dropping 5 cookies, he would have:
\[ 100 - 5 = 95 \text{ cookies} \]

Since he has 110 cookies in total (after the drop), our calculation seems correct.

**Final Answer:**
Henry baked **50 cookies** last year.<|im_end|>","Adding the cookies Henry dropped shows he baked 110 + 5 = <<110+5=115>>115 cookies this year.
He had cooked too many, so he must have needed 115 – 15 = <<115-15=100>>100 cookies to double last year’s amount.
Therefore, he must have cooked 100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 cookies last year.

                    ? A local gas , station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon.  An app company is offering $.20 cashback per ! gallon if you fill ! up at ? this station.  If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the cashback rewards?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost without any discounts**

- The price of one gallon of gas is $3.00.
- Someone buys 10 gallons.

Total cost = (Price per gallon) × (Number of gallons)
= $3.00 × 10
= $30.00

So far, we've calculated that the total cost before any discounts would be $30.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the cashback reward**

- The app company offers a cashback of $0.20 per gallon.
- Someone buys 10 gallons.

Cashback amount = (Cashback per gallon) × (Number of gallons)
= $0.20 × 10
= $2.00

**Step 3: Subtract the cashback from the original cost**

Final total cost = Total cost - Cashback
= $30.00 - $2.00
= $28.00

Therefore, after applying the cashback rewards, the person will spend **$28.00** on gas.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is The person will spend $28.00 on gas.<|im_end|>","Gas is $3.00 a gallon and they buy 10 gallons of gas so that's 3*10 = $<<3*10=30.00>>30.00

                    question:
                    Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups, so they unroll as many as they . can find. Unfortunately, someone makes a mistake and Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long while Marcell's was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fruit roll-ups each person consumed and then calculate the average.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups in Beatrice's batch.
- Beatrice's roll-ups are two roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups in Beatrice's batch is calculated by multiplying the width by the length:
  \[
  \text{Total roll-ups} = 2 \times 24 = 48
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roll-ups in Marcell's batch.
- Marcell's roll-ups are three roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.
- The total number of roll-ups in Marcell's batch is calculated by multiplying the width by the length:
  \[
  \text{Total roll-ups} = 3 \times 14 = 42
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the average number of roll-ups eaten per person.
- Since both individuals ate all their roll-ups, we simply take the average of the total roll-ups from both batches:
  \[
  \text{Average roll-ups per person} = \frac{\text{Total roll-ups (Beatrice)} + \text{Total roll-ups (Marcell)}}{2}
  \]
  Substituting the values we found:
  \[
  \text{Average roll-ups per person} = \frac{48 + 42}{2} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
  \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The average number of roll-ups each person ate is 45}.<|im_end|>","Beatrice ate 48 because 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the rate at which water is added:**
   - We know that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet.
   
2. **Calculate the total distance rowed:**
   - The boat rows back towards shore for a total of 20 feet.
   - The shore is 64 feet from where Julia started.

3. **Find the total distance rowed in terms of 10-foot increments:**
   - Since the boat travels back 20 feet, we need to determine how many 10-foot segments fit into these 20 feet.
     \[
     \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ segments}
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water added per segment:**
   - Each segment corresponds to 2 liters of water (as given).
   
5. **Sum up the total amount of water added over all segments:**
   - Multiply the number of segments by the amount of water per segment.
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ liters}
     \]

Therefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on a total of **4 liters** of water.<|im_end|>","It took Julia 64 seconds to reach shore, so it took 64 / 16 = <<64/16=4>>4 times rowing 20 feet to reach the shore.

In those 80 feet, she took on 2 liters of water 80 / 10 = <<80/10=8>>8 times.
Thus, the boat had taken on 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore.

<|im_start|>answer
To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in one day, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of lessons per day**:
   - There are 4 teachers.
   - Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

   Therefore, the total number of lessons per day = Number of teachers * Lessons per teacher
   \[
   \text{Total lessons/day} = 4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the frequency of cleaning for each lesson**:
   - The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

3. **Calculate the total number of cleanings per day**:
   - Since there are 8 lessons per day and each lesson results in 3 cleanings,
   
   Total cleanings/day = (Number of lessons/day) × Cleanings per lesson
   \[
   \text{Total cleanings/day} = 8 \times 3 = 24
   \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in one day.

The final answer is: {The final answer is} 24 times.<|im_end|>","In one day, there are a total of 4 teachers * 2 lessons each = <<4*2=8>>8 lessons.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the maximum number of photographs on Brittany's phone.
Given that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we need to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

Let \( B \) represent the maximum number of photographs on Brittany's phone.

According to the information given:
\[ 6B = \text{number of photographs on Jamal's phone} \]

We know that Jamal's phone holds 1800 photographs:
\[ 6B = 1800 \]

Now, we solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} \]
\[ B = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

### Step 2: Determine the number of birds in Jamal's photograph.
We are told that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph (which is also the number of ducks since they're ducks) is 50 times the number of birds in Brittany's photograph.

Let \( R \) represent the number of birds in Brittany's photograph.

According to the information given:
\[ R = \text{number of birds in Brittany's photograph} \]

We don't have an exact value for \( R \), but we know:
\[ 50R \] represents the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
Since the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is equal to the number of birds in Brittany's photograph multiplied by 50:
\[ \text{Number of ducks} = 50R \]

From Step 1, we know that Brittany's phone has 300 photographs, so:
\[ R = 300 \]

Substitute \( R \) back into the equation for the number of ducks:
\[ \text{Number of ducks} = 50 \times 300 \]
\[ \text{Number of ducks} = 15000 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total initial cost of the lumber.
Sasha initially bought 15 pieces of lumber (10 × 2x4x10 + 5 × 4x4x10) at different costs.

- Cost per piece = $10
- Number of 2x4x10 boards purchased = 10
- Number of 4x4x10 boards purchased = 5

Total cost for 2x4x10 boards = 10 × $10 = $100
Total cost for 4x4x10 boards = 5 × $16 = $80

Initial total cost = $100 + $80 = $180

### Step 2: Calculate the new price per board after the increase.
The price increased by 50%, so the new price per board is:
\[ \text{New Price} = \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.
Since there was no mention of any discounts or sales tax, we assume a perfect sale without loss due to market conditions.

Revenue from selling 15 boards at $15 each:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 15 \times \$15 = \$225 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total Revenue - Initial Total Cost
\[ \text{Profit} = \$225 - \$180 = \$45 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$45}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given ratio**:
   The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is \(7:13\).

2. **Set up the equation based on the ratio**:
   Let's denote the amount of sugar as \(S\) teaspoons and the amount of water as \(W\) cups. According to the ratio, we have:
   \[
   \frac{S}{W} = \frac{7}{13}
   \]

3. **Use the total amounts provided**:
   We know that the total amount of sugar used is 120 teaspoons, so \(S = 120\). Also, the total amount of water used is \(W\) cups.

4. **Express \(W\) in terms of \(S\) from the ratio**:
   From the ratio, we can write:
   \[
   S = \frac{7}{13}W
   \]
   Substitute \(S = 120\) into the equation:
   \[
   120 = \frac{7}{13}W
   \]

5. **Solve for \(W\)**:
   To find \(W\), divide both sides by \(\frac{7}{13}\):
   \[
   W = \frac{120 \times 13}{7}
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   W = \frac{120 \times 13}{7} = \frac{1560}{7} \approx 222.857
   \]

6. **Verify the solution**:
   Now, substitute \(W \approx 222.857\) back into the original ratio to check if it holds true:
   \[
   \frac{S}{W} = \frac{120}{222.857} \approx \frac{7}{13}
   \]
   This confirms our values are consistent.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pairs of shoes John bought.
2. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes.
3. Multiply the total number of pairs by the price per pair.

Step 1: Determine how many pairs of shoes John bought.
John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. Therefore, he bought \(3 \times 2 = 6\) pairs of shoes.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes.
Since each pair consists of 2 individual shoes, the total number of pairs is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

Step 3: Multiply the total number of pairs by the price per pair.
Each pair costs $60, so the total amount paid is \(12 \times 60 = \$720\).

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many containers were imported on the second day given the initial conditions and the final total.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - On the first day, there are 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
     \[
     2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Total After First Day:**
   - The total number of vehicles after the first day is 30.
   
3. **Containers Imported on Second Day:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of containers imported on the second day.
   - Each container still contains 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from these new containers would be \( 5x \).
   - The equation representing the total number of vehicles after the second day is:
     \[
     10 + 5x = 30
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     5x = 30 - 10
     \]
     \[
     5x = 20
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{5}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4

                    question:
                    Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary:**
   - Let \( S_L \) be Lylah's original salary.
   - According to the problem, Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. Therefore, Adrien's initial salary \( S_A \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     S_A = S_L + 0.3S_L = 1.3S_L
     \]
   - We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. So we have:
     \[
     1.3S_L = 40000
     \]
   - Solving for \( S_L \):
     \[
     S_L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
     \]

2. **Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later:**
   - After four years, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. His new salary \( S_{A}' \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_{A}' = S_A + 0.4S_A = 1.4S_A
     \]
   - Substituting \( S_A \) from step 1:
     \[
     S_{A}' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
     \]

3. **Lylah's Salary Four Years Later:**
   - Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Her new salary \( S_L' \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_L' = S_L + 0.4S_L = 1.4S_L
     \]
   - Using the value of \( S_L \) found in step 1:
     \[
     S_L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43117.92
     \]

4. **Total Salary Four Years Later:**
   - The total combined salary of Adrien and Lylah after four years would be:
     \[
     S_{total} = S_{A}' + S_L'
     \]
   - Substituting the values found in steps 2 and 3:
     \[
     S_{total} = 56000 + 43117.92 \approx 99117.92
     \]

Therefore, the total salary both were receiving four years later is approximately $99,117.92.<|im_end|>","Since Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago and received a raise that makes him earn 40% more, he received a 40/100*$40000 = $<<40/100*40000=16000>>16000 raise.
In total, four years later, Adrien's salary is $40000+$16000 = $56000
If four years ago Adrien was earning $40000, and Lylah's salary was 30% less, then Lylah's salary was 30/100*$40000= $12000 less than Adrien's salary four years ago.
Four years ago, Lylah was earning $40000-$12000 =$28000
After receiving a 40% raise, Lylah earns 40/100*$28000 = $<<40/100*28000=11200>>11200
In total, four years later, Lylah earns $28000+$11200= $<<28000+11200=39200>>39200.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of sheets used per day:**
   - Miguel uses 2 pads per week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets.
   - Therefore, the total number of sheets used in one week = \( 2 \text{ pads} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} \).

\[
2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ sheets}
\]

2. **Convert weeks to days:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\frac{60 \text{ sheets}}{7 \text{ days}} \approx 8.57 \text{ sheets/day}
\]

3. **Calculate the total sheets used in one month (assuming 4 weeks):**
   - Since we have calculated that Miguel uses approximately 8.57 sheets per day, we can find out how many sheets he uses in four weeks.

\[
8.57 \text{ sheets/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \approx 34.28 \text{ sheets/month}

   - Morisette has 5 apples.
   - Morisette has 8 oranges.

2. **Sum the total number of fruits Morisette brings:**
   \[
   5 \text{ (apples)} + 8 \text{ (oranges)} = 13 \text{ fruits}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of apples Kael brings:**
   - Kael brings twice the amount of apples as Morisette.
   - Morisette has 5 apples.
   - Therefore, Kael has \(2 \times 5\) apples.

4. **Calculate the number of apples Kael brings:**
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: Sadie slept 8 hours.
   - Total for Monday: \( 8 \) hours.

2. **Tuesday**: She slept 2 hours less than Monday.
   - Calculation: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) hours.
   - Total for Tuesday: \( 6 \) hours.

3. **Wednesday**: Again, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday.
   - Calculation: \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) hours.
   - Total for Wednesday: \( 4 \) hours.

4. **Thursday**: This day, she slept 1 hour more than what she had done over the previous three days combined.
   - Calculation: The sum of Tuesday and Wednesday (both 6 hours): \( 6 + 6 = 12 \) hours.
     - Then add 1 hour more: \( 12 + 1 = 13 \) hours.
   - Total for Thursday: \( 13 \) hours.

5. **Friday**: Finally, she slept 1 hour more than what she did on Thursday.
   - Calculation: \( 13 + 1 = 14 \) hours.
   - Total for Friday: \( 14 \) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of time Sadie slept during the entire week:

- Summing up all her sleep times from Monday to Friday:
  \( 8 + 6 + 4 + 13 + 14 \).

Let's perform the addition:
\( 8 + 6 = 14 \),
\( 14 + 4 = 18 \),
\( 18 + 13 = 31 \),
\( 31 + 14 = 45 \).

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: calculating how far Rosie can run at her initial speed and then adding the distance she covers after increasing her speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie can run at her initial speed**

Rosie's initial running speed is 10 miles per hour. She runs for 3 hours at this speed.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance at initial speed = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken for the second part of her run**

After 3 hours, she increases her speed to 5 miles per hour and runs for another 4 hours (since 7 hours total minus the first 3 hours).
- Time = Total time - Initial time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the distance Rosie can run at her increased speed**

Now, we calculate the distance she can cover at her new speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 4 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance at increased speed = 5 mph × 4 hours = 20 miles

**Step 4: Add the distances from both parts of her run**

Finally, we add the distance covered at her initial speed and the distance covered at her increased speed to find the total distance she can run.
- Total distance = Distance at initial speed + Distance at increased speed = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run **50 miles** in 7 hours.<|im_end|>","For the first 3 hours, Rosie runs 10 miles per hour, so she runs 10*3=<<10*3=30>>30 miles.

For the next 4 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour, so she runs 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 miles.
In total she runs 30+20=<<30+20=50>>50 miles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of letters needing stamps initially:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of letters needing stamps.
   - We know that \( x = 60 \).

2. **Calculate the number of letters needing stamps after Jennie adds stamps to some of them:**
   - Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   - Therefore, she adds stamps to \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters.

3. **Express the number of letters needing stamps after adding stamps:**
   - The remaining letters needing stamps will be \( x - \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Simplify this expression:
     \[
     x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
     \]

4. **Substitute the known value of \( x \):**
   - Since \( x = 60 \), we substitute this into our equation:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} = \frac{2 \times 60}{3} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
     \]
   - So, after adding stamps, there are 40 letters needing stamps.

5. **Determine the number of letters already stamped:**
   - We know that after adding stamps, there are 30 letters already stamped.
   - Let \( y \) be the initial number of letters already stamped.
   - After adding stamps to \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters, the number of letters already stamped increases by \( \frac{x}{3} \).

6. **Set up an equation for the increase in the number of letters already stamped:**
   - The increase in the number of letters already stamped is equal to the number of letters added (which is \( \frac{x}{3} \)).
   - Therefore, \( \frac{x}{3} = 30 \).

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( \frac{x}{3} = 30 \) back into our earlier equation for the total number of letters needing stamps:
     \[
     x = 60
     \]

8. **Verify the solution:**
   - Initially, there are 60 letters needing stamps.
   - One-third of these letters are added with stamps, so \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) letters are added.
   - This leaves \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) letters needing stamps.
   - Adding stamps to 20 letters means there are now \( 30 + 20 = 50 \) letters already stamped, which matches the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of one pepper
We are given that each pepper costs $15.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of one watermelon
According to the information provided, a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper.
- Cost of one pepper = $15
- Therefore, cost of one watermelon = \(3 \times \$15\) = **\$45**

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of one orange
An orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon.
- Cost of one watermelon = **\$45**
- Therefore, cost of one orange = **\$45 - \$5** = **\$40**

### Step 4: Determine the total cost for all items
Now we need to calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

- Cost of 4 watermelons = \(4 \times \$45\) = **\$180**
- Cost of 20 peppers = \(20 \times \$15\) = **\$300**
- Cost of 10 oranges = \(10 \times \$40\) = **\$400**

### Step 5: Sum up all the costs
Total amount spent = Cost of watermelons + Cost of peppers + Cost of oranges
\[ Total\ amount\ spent = \$180 + \$300 + \$400 \]

### Final calculation
Let's do the addition:
\[ Total\ amount\ spent = \$180 + \$300 + \$400 = \$980 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is **\$980**.<|im_end|>","A watermelon costs three times what pepper costs, which is 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Number of Visits Per Day
Given that there are 500 people per day.

\[ \text{Total number of visits} = 500 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Time Spent on Visits Per Day
Each visit lasts for 24 minutes. We need to convert this time into hours because the hospital charges its fees in hourly rates.

\[ \text{Time spent per visit (in hours)} = \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, multiply this by the total number of visits:

\[ \text{Total time spent on visits} = 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Revenue From Patient Fees
The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients. 

\[ \text{Revenue from patient fees} = 200 \times 200 = \$40,000 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Hospital Costs
The hospital charges $150 per hour to its staff.

\[ \text{Hospital costs} = 150 \times 200 = \$30,000 \]

### Step 5: Calculate Profit
Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue from patient fees} - \text{Hospital costs} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = 40,000 - 30,000 = \$10,000 \]

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits per day.<|im_end|>","The hospital sees patients for 500*24=<<500*24=12000>>12000 minutes a day

They profit 200-150=$<<200-150=50>>50 per hour
So they make a profit of 200 hours * $50/hour = $<<200*50=10000>>10000 a day from patient visits

To determine how many elves remain at the end, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of elves who quit initially**
Nissa has hired 60 elves.

A third of the elves quit because of children vomiting.
Number of elves that quit due to vomiting = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60\)

Let's calculate this:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
\]

So, 20 elves quit because of children vomiting.

**Step 2: Subtract the elves who quit due to vomiting from the total number hired**

Total elves hired - Elves who quit due to vomiting = \(60 - 20\)
\(40\) elves remain after some quit due to vomiting.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of elves who quit later**

Out of the remaining 40 elves, 10 quit after kids kicked their shins.

**Step 4: Subtract the elves who quit after being kicked by kids from the remaining elves**

Remaining elves - Elves who quit after being kicked = \(40 - 10\)
\(30\) elves remain after those who were kicked out.

Therefore, the number of elves left is **30**.<|im_end|>","First, divide the starting number of elves by 3 to find out how many quit after being vomited on, which is 60 elves / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 elves.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rides taken by both Pam and Fred, then multiply that by the cost per ride.

1. Calculate the total number of rides for Pam:
   - Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times.
   - She also rode the luge 2 times (since she decides to ride it after the roller coaster).
   - So, Pam's total rides = 2 + 2 = 4 rides.

2. Calculate the total number of rides for Fred:
   - Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times (as given in the problem statement).
   - He also rode the luge 2 times (since he decides to ride it after the roller coaster).
   - So, Fred's total rides = 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

3. Calculate the total number of rides combined:
   - Combined total rides = Pam's rides + Fred's rides = 4 + 6 = 10 rides.

4. Calculate the total number of tickets used:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
- Walt walked 4 miles on Monday.
- On Tuesday, he walked \(6\) times as many miles as he walked on Monday.

\[
\text{Miles on Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Miles on Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total distance Walt walked from Monday to Tuesday.
- Total distance from Monday to Tuesday:

\[
\text{Total distance (Monday + Tuesday)} = 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday.
- The total mileage for Monday through Wednesday is given as \(41\) miles.

\[
\text{Total mileage (Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday)} = 41 \text{ miles}
\]
  
We already know the distances for Monday and Tuesday, so we can find the distance for Wednesday by subtracting the known distances from the total:

\[
\text{Miles on Wednesday} = \text{Total mileage} - (\text{Miles on Monday} + \text{Miles on Tuesday})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Miles on Wednesday} = 41 \text{ miles} - (4 \text{ miles} + 24 \text{ miles}) = 41 \text{ miles} - 28 \text{ miles} = 13 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Walt walked **13 miles** on Wednesday.<|im_end|>","Walt’s Tuesday walk was 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 miles.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Tom pays in a year for car washing, let's break this down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many car washes Tom performs in a year**

Tom gets 4 cars every month. We need to find out how many months there are in a year.

- There are typically 12 months in a year.
- Since Tom washes his car once per month, we can calculate the total number of car washes as follows:

\[ \text{Total car washes} = 4 \text{ (cars)} \times 12 \text{ (months/year)} \]

\[ \text{Total car washes} = 48 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for all car washes in a year**

Each car wash costs $15. To find the total amount paid for all car washes, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per wash.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ (car washes)} \times \$15 \text{ (per wash)} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$720 \]

Therefore, Tom pays a total of **$720** in a year for car washing.<|im_end|>","He gets 4*12=<<4*12=48>>48 car washes a year

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many video games Bobby initially had.
2. Adjust for the fact that Brian lost some games.
3. Recalculate the number of video games Bobby has.

Let's start with step 1:

1. **Determine how many video games Bobby initially had:**
   - According to the problem, Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.
   - Brian has 20 video games.
   - Therefore, Bobby's initial number of video games can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's initial number} = 3 \times (\text{Brian's number}) - 5
     \]
     Substituting Brian's number:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's initial number} = 3 \times 20 - 5
     \]

2. **Calculate Bobby's initial number of video games:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's initial number} = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]

Now, let's move on to step 2:

3. **Adjust for the fact that Brian lost some games:**
   - Brian loses 5 games.
   - Subtract 5 from Bobby's initial number:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's new number} = 55 - 5
     \]

4. **Recalculate the number of video games Bobby has after losing some:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Bobby's new number} = 50
     \]

So, Bobby now has 50 video games.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]<|im_end|>","If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games

We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.

                    question:
                    Rory orders 2 subs for , $7.50 each, 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each and 2 cookies for $1.00 each for delivery.  There’s a 20% delivery fee added at check out and she wants to add a $5.00 tip. !  What will her delivery order cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the sub items.
- Rory orders 2 subs, each costing $7.50.
\[
2 \times \$7.50 = \$15.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chip bag items.
- Rory buys 2 bags of chips, each costing $1.50.
\[
2 \times \$1.50 = \$3.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the cookie items.
- Rory buys 2 cookies, each costing $1.00.
\[
2 \times \$1.00 = \$2.00
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all item costs.
\[
\$15.00 (subs) + \$3.00 (chips) + \$2.00 (cookies) = \$20.00
\]

### Step 5: Add the delivery fee.
There is a 20% delivery fee on top of the subtotal.

First, calculate 20% of the subtotal (\$20.00):
\[
0.20 \times \$20.00 = \$4.00
\]
Add this fee to the subtotal:
\[
\$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00
\]

### Step 6: Add the tip.
Rory also wants to add a $5.00 tip to the total after the delivery fee has been applied.

So, add the tip to the amount including the delivery fee:
\[
\$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00
\]

### Final Answer:
The total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\).<|im_end|>","2 subs are $7.50 each so that’s 2*7.50 = $<<2*7.5=15.00>>15.00

                    question:
                    Mark took a test yesterday that consisted of 75 questions. He completed the test at a rate of 5 questions per hour. Today, he took another test of 100 questions at the same rate. If Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test and 6 hours : to complete the second one, how many questions did he leave incomplete?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he can solve in each test based on his rate and then subtract this from the total number of questions in each test.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Mark can solve in the first test.
- The first test consists of 75 questions.
- Mark completes it at a rate of 5 questions per hour.
- Mark has 8 hours available for the first test.

First, find out how many questions Mark can solve in 8 hours:

\[ \text{Questions solved} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Questions solved} = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Questions solved} = 40 \]

Since Mark only needs to solve 75 questions but can only solve 40 in 8 hours, he leaves:

\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \]

questions incomplete after completing the first test.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of questions Mark can solve in the second test.
- The second test also consists of 100 questions.
- Mark completes it at the same rate of 5 questions per hour.
- Mark has 6 hours available for the second test.

Next, find out how many questions Mark can solve in 6 hours:

\[ \text{Questions solved} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Questions solved} = 5 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Questions solved} = 30 \]

Since Mark only needs to solve 100 questions but can only solve 30 in 6 hours, he leaves:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

questions incomplete after completing the second test.

### Final Answer:
Mark left **35** questions incomplete after completing the first test and **70** questions incomplete after completing the second test.<|im_end|>","Questions Mark completed in yesterday’s test: 5*8 = <<5*8=40>>40.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of blue gumballs.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the problem statement, the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We know that there are 12 blue gumballs.

3. **Express the Relationship Mathematically:**
   The relationship can be written as:
   \[
   \text{Number of pink gumballs} = 4x + 22

                    Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are ! automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and ? the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the ? cars are semi-automatic?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine the number of semi-automatic cars and subsequently find the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total cars, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Total number of cars = 20
- Number of automatic cars = 12
- Number of manual cars = 4

### Step 2: Determine the number of semi-automatic cars
Since all cars can be either automatic or semi-automatic (or both), we need to subtract the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars.

Number of semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]

Calculate the sum inside the parentheses first:

\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, subtract this sum from the total number of cars:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars.

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars
To find the percentage, use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the numbers:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100
\]

Perform the division and multiplication:

\[
\text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is **20%**.<|im_end|>","12 + 4 = <<12+4=16>>16 cars are either automatic or manual.
So, 20 - 16 = <<20-16=4>>4 cars are semi-automatic.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of worker bees based on the given relationships between different types of bees. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
   - Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Relationships:**
   According to the problem statement, we have three key relationships:
   
   - There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \( W = 2B \)
   - There are twice as many baby bees as queens: \( B = 2Q \)

3. **Express Baby Bees in Terms of Queens:**
   From the second relationship, we can express the number of baby bees (\( B \)) in terms of queens (\( Q \)):
   \[ B = 2Q \]

4. **Express Worker Bees in Terms of Babies:**
   Using the first relationship (twice as many worker bees as baby bees), we get:
   \[ W = 2B \]
   Substitute \( B \) from the previous equation into this:
   \[ W = 2(2Q) \]
   Simplify this expression:
   \[ W = 4Q \]

5. **Total Number of Bees Equation:**
   We know that the total number of bees is 700:
   \[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
   Substitute \( W \) and \( B \) using their expressions in terms of \( Q \):
   \[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[ 7Q = 700 \]

6. **Solve for \( Q \):**
   Divide both sides by 7:
   \[ Q = \frac{700}{7} \]
   Simplify:
   \[ Q = 100 \]

7. **Find the Number of Baby Bees (\( B \)):**
   Since \( B = 2Q \):
   \[ B = 2 \times 100 \]
   Calculate:
   \[ B = 200 \]

8. **Find the Number of Worker Bees (\( W \)):**
   Using \( W = 4Q \):
   \[ W = 4 \times 100 \]
   Calculate:
   \[ W = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of queens

Jordan spends 2 hours every day on video games.

\[ \text{Total daily gaming time} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \]

**Step 2: Determine weekly gaming time**
Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Weekly gaming time} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly gaming time} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

**Step 3: Calculate earnings from the part-time job**
Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job.

\[ \text{Earnings from part-time job} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} \]

\[ \text{Earnings from part-time job} = \$140/\text{week} \]

Total cost before tax = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

### Step 2: Calculate the tax amount
There is a 10% tax on all non-food items (light bulbs, cups, roach traps).

Tax amount = Total cost of non-food items * Tax rate
Tax amount = ($3 + $3 + $4) * 0.10
Tax amount = $10 * 0.10 = $1

To calculate the profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Currently, Kim has 3 clients.
   - He is also talking to 5 more potential clients.

   Total number of clients = Current clients + Potential clients
   \[
   \text{Total number of clients} = 3 + 5 = 8
   \]

2. **Determine the number of bottles of bleach needed per client:**
   - Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach.

   Total bottles of bleach required = Number of clients × Bottles of bleach per client
   \[
   \text{Total bottles of bleach required} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for bottles of bleach:**
   - Each bottle costs $2.

   Total cost for bottles of bleach = Total bottles of bleach required × Cost per bottle
   \[
   \text{Total cost for bottles of bleach} = 16 \times 2 = \$32
   \]

4. **Determine the number of packs of cloth needed per client:**
   - Each client needs 1 pack of cloth.

   Total packs of cloth required = Number of clients

   Since there's no mention of additional packs beyond what was initially calculated, let's assume it remains at 5 (since this seems consistent with the initial setup).

   Total packs of cloth required = 5

5. **Calculate the total cost for packs of cloth:**
   - Each pack costs $5.

   Total cost for packs of cloth = Total packs of cloth required × Cost per pack
   \[
   \text{Total cost for packs of cloth} = 5 \times 5 = \$25
   \]

6. **Sum up all expenses:**
   - Expenses consist of both bottles of bleach and packs of cloth.

   Total expenses = Cost for bottles of bleach + Cost for packs of cloth
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 32 + 25 = \$57
   \]

7. **Calculate the total income:**
   - The total income is given as $92.

   Total income = $92

8. **Compute the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total income and total expenses.

   Profit = Total income - Total expenses
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 92 - 57 = \$35
   \]

**Final Answer:** 
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pineapples in the entire field.
John has 10 hectares of land.

- Number of pineapples per hectare = 100 pineapples/hares

Total number of pineapples in the field:
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = \text{Number of pineapples per ha} \times \text{Number of ha} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 100 \times 10 \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 1000 \]

So far, we have calculated that there are 1000 pineapples on John's entire field.

### Step 2: Determine how often John can harvest his pineapples.
John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of harvesting periods in one year.
There are 12 months in a year.

Number of harvesting periods in one year:
\[ \text{Number of harvesting periods} = \frac{\text{Total months in a year}}{\text{Months between harvests}} \]
\[ \text{Number of harvesting periods} = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ \text{Number of harvesting periods} = 4 \]

So, John can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year.
We know from Step 1 that there are 1000 pineapples on the field.

Since John can harvest 1000 pineapples per period (harvesting every 3 months), we calculate the total number of pineapples harvested in a year as follows:
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested} = \text{Number of pineapples per period} \times \text{Number of harvesting periods} \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested} = 1000 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total pineapples harvested} = 4000 \]

Therefore, John can harvest **4000** pineapples within a year.

                    question:
                    Johnny is picking up the toys on the floor of his room.  He'd ? dumped a lego boxed set with 500 pieces on the floor, , and another one that had 3 times more pieces than ! the 500 piece ; one, and another one that . had 1/4 the number of pieces.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Lego pieces Johnny has in total after picking up all the Legos from different boxes.

1. **Identify the number of pieces in each box:**
   - The first box contains 500 pieces.
   - The second box has \(3 \times 500\) pieces (since it has 3 times more pieces than the first box).
     \[
     3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - The third box has \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of pieces in the first box.
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of pieces:**
   - Add the number of pieces from all three boxes together.
     \[
     500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

Therefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 Lego pieces.

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{2125}
\]<|im_end|>","The first set had 500 pieces, and the second set had 3 times as many as the first set, so the second set has 500*3=<<500*3=1500>>1500 pieces
The third set had one-quarter of the 500 pieces, so that means it had 500*.25= <<500*.25=125>>125 pieces
In total, that means Johnny picked up 500 + 1500+ 125= <<500+1500+125=2125>>2125 blocks

                    question:
                    Debra is monitoring . a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees , 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 ! hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break down the observations made by Debra and calculate the number of bees returning to the hive over time.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Debra sees 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours.
   - The next 6 hours, half that many bees (i.e., \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \)) return to the hive.

2. **Second Observation:**
   - In the next 6 hours, Debra sees twice as many bees as those that left initially. So, there are \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \) bees flying away from the hive.
   - The same amount that return to the hive as observed previously (i.e., 15).

3. **Third Observation:**
   - Finally, in the remaining 6 hours, Debra observes an equal number of bees leaving the hive compared to those that had not yet returned. Since 15 bees had not returned after the initial observation, there will also be 15 bees leaving the hive in the last 6 hours.

4. **Calculating Total Bees Returning:**
   - Initially, 15 bees returned during the second period.
   - During the third period, 15 bees return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is calculated as follows:
\[ 15 + 15 = 30 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","Debra first sees 30 bees leave the hive, then sees 1/2 that many return, 30 x 1/2 = <<30*1/2=15>>15 bees that return and 15 bees that are still away from the hive.
Debra sees twice as many bees as first left the hive--which was 30--fly from the hive in the next 6 hours, 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 bees that leave the hive.
In total, 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 bees left the hive.
There were 90 bees total that left the hive - 15 bees that already returned = <<90-15=75>>75 bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

                    question:
                    Brittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission : is $12 for adults : and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money, ! in dollars, did she give the cashier?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of the tickets:**
   - Each adult ticket costs $12.
   - Each child ticket costs $10.

2. **Calculate the total amount given as change:**
   - Brittany's mom gave $8 in change after buying one child ticket and one adult ticket.

3. **Set up an equation to find out how much money was initially given:**

Let \( x \) be the amount of money Brittany's mom gave to the cashier.

- The total cost of one child ticket is $10.
- The total cost of one adult ticket is $12.

So, the total amount paid should equal the initial amount plus the change received.

\[ \text{Total Amount Paid} = \$x \]
\[ \text{Change Received} = \$8 \]

According to the problem, the total amount paid equals the initial amount plus the change received:

\[ x = \text{Initial Amount} + \$8 \]

4. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**

We know that the total cost of one child ticket is $10 and the total cost of one adult ticket is $12.

Therefore,

\[ x = (\$12 + \$10) + \$8 \]

5. **Simplify the expression:**

\[ x = \$22 + \$8 \]

6. **Perform the addition:**

\[ x = \$30 \]

7. **Verify the calculation:**

If Brittany's mom gave $30 initially, then the total cost would be:

\[ \$30 - \$8 = \$22 \]

This matches the total cost of two tickets ($12 for an adult and $10 for a child).

**Conclusion:**

Brittany's mom gave the cashier a total of **\$30**.<|im_end|>","The total cost of the tickets is 12+10=<<12+10=22>>22 dollars.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has based on the information given about Charlie's friends.

Step 1: Determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has.
- We know that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.
- Therefore, Dorothy must have \( \frac{1}{3} \) of Charlie’s number of friends.
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{\text{Charlie's friends}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Step 2: Calculate how many Facebook friends James has.
- We know that James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.
- Therefore, James has \( 4 \times 4 \).
\[ \text{James' friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Final Answer:

                    Steve and Tim decide to . see who can get ? home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at ? 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away from the school.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine who wins the race and for how long they wait, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach the school.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance each person rides:**
   - Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles}\)
   - Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Convert distances to the same unit (feet):**
   - 1 mile = 5280 feet
   - Therefore, \(3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 = 15,840 \text{ feet}\)
   - Similarly, \(2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 = 10,560 \text{ feet}\)

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach the school:**
   - Speed of Steve = \(440 \text{ feet per minute}\)
   - Time taken by Steve = Distance / Speed
   - Time taken by Steve = \(15,840 \text{ feet} / 440 \text{ feet per minute}\)
   - Time taken by Steve = \(36 \text{ minutes}\)

4. **Calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach the school:**
   - Speed of Tim = \(264 \text{ feet per minute}\)
   - Time taken by Tim = Distance / Speed
   - Time taken by Tim = \(10,560 \text{ feet} / 264 \text{ feet per minute}\)
   - Time taken by Tim = \(40 \text{ minutes}\)

5. **Determine who wins the race:**
   - Steve wins because his time (36 minutes) is less than Tim’s time (40 minutes).

6. **Calculate how long the winner waits for the loser:**
   - The winner waits until the time when the loser has completed their journey.
   - Since Steve won, the winner (Steve) waits for Tim to finish.
   - Time difference between them: \(40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4 \text{ minutes}} \]<|im_end|>","Steve has to travel 3 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<3*5280=15840>>15840 feet to get home.

Tim has to travel 2 miles * (5280 feet/1 mile) = <<2*5280=10560>>10560 feet to get home.
It will take Tim 10560 feet / (264 feet/minute) = <<10560/264=40>>40 minutes to get home.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Shawnda made from inflating the tires for the different types of vehicles (bicycles, tricycles, and unicycles) based on the given information.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Bicycles:**
   - There were 5 people who came for bicycles.
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Cost per tire = $0.25
   
   Calculation for the bicycles:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tires per bicycle} \times \text{Cost per tire}
   \]
   Since there are 5 bicycles and each has 2 tires:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tires} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for bicycles} = 10 \times 0.25 = \$2.50
   \]

2. **Tricycles:**
   - There were 3 people who came for tricycles.
   - Each tricycle also has 2 tires.
   - Cost per tire = $0.25
   
   Calculation for the tricycles:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tires per tricycle} \times \text{Cost per tire}
   \]
   Since there are 3 tricycles and each has 2 tires:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tires} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ tires}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for tricycles} = 6 \times 0.25 = \$1.50
   \]

3. **Unicycles:**
   - Only 1 person came for unicycles.
   - Each unicycle has 1 tire.
   - Cost per tire = $0.25
   
   Calculation for the unicycles:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tires per unicycle} \times \text{Cost per tire}
   \]
   Since there is 1 unicycle and each has 1 tire:
   \[
   \text{Total number of tires} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for unicycles} = 1 \times 0.25 = \$0.25
   \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   Sum up the total costs for all vehicles:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total cost for bicycles} + \text{Total cost for tricycles} + \text{Total cost for unicycles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \$2.50 + \$1.50 + \$0.25 = \$4.25
   \]

Therefore, Shawnda made a total of $4.25 that day.<|im_end|>","There were 10 bike tires to fill up because 2 times 5 equals <<2*5=10>>10.
There were 9 tricycle tires to fill up because 3 times 3 equals <<3*3=9>>9.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies**
Carl buys ten packs of cookies.
Each pack contains six cookies.

\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cookies per pack}
\]

\[
= 10 \times 6
\]

\[
= 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies**
Each cookie costs $0.10.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total number of cookies} \times \text{Cost per cookie}
\]

\[
= 60 \times 0.10
\]

\[
= 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of change Carl receives**
Carl pays with a $10 bill.

\[
\text{Change received} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost}
\]

\[
= 10 - 6
\]

\[
= 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 4 dollars.<|im_end|>","A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.
Thus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.
Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. **Initial French Fries Count**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of fries Dave originally bought.

2. **French Fries Eaten Before the Seagull**:
   - Dave eats 14 fries.
   
3. **Seagull Theft**:
   - The seagull steals half of what Dave has left (after eating 14 fries), so the seagull takes \( \frac{1}{2} \times (x - 14) \).

4. **Pigeon Attack**:
   - After the seagull leaves, there are \( (x - 14) - \left( \frac{1}{2} \times (x - 14) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \times (x - 14) \) fries left.
   - A group of pigeons steal one-third of these fries: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} \times (x - 14) = \frac{1}{6} \times (x - 14) \).

5. **Raccoon Theft**:
   - The raccoon steals two-thirds of the remaining fries after the pigeons have eaten some, so it takes \( \frac{2}{3} \times \left[ \frac{1}{6} \times (x - 14) \right] = \frac{1}{9} \times (x - 14) \).
   
6. **Ants' Action**:
   - After the raccoon leaves, ants take away one more fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - We know that after all these events, 5 fries remain.
   - Therefore, we can set up an equation to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5 = 5 + \frac{1}{6} \times (x - 14) + \frac{1}{9} \times (x - 14) - \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{6} \times (x - 14)
     \]

8. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   5 = 5 + \frac{x - 14}{6} + \frac{x - 14}{9} - \frac{x - 14}{18}
   \]
   Combine terms over a common denominator:
   \[
   5 = 5 + \frac{3(x - 14) + 2(x - 14) - (x - 14)}{18}
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   5 = 5 + \frac{3x - 42 + 2x - 28 - x + 14}{18}
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   5 = 5 + \frac{4x - 66}{18}
   \]
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   0 = \frac{4x - 66}{18}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 18:
   \[
   0 = 4x - 66
   \]
   Add 66 to both sides:
   \[
   66 = 4x
   \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[
   x = 16.5
   \]

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 16.5.<|im_end|>","Dave ate 14 french fries, so the seagull ate 14 * 1/2 = 14 / 2 = <<14*1/2=7>>7 fries.

The ants took one french fry, so there were 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 after the racoon took some.
The raccoon left 1/3 behind, so there were 6 * 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 fries before the raccoon took any.
Thus, the pack had 14 + 7 + 9 + 18 = <<14+7+9+18=48>>48 fries in it when Dave bought it.

In . one semester, there are 16 ; weeks of school.  In one : semester, how many hours does Kimo spend attending classes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of class days in one week.
- There are 3 Monday-Wednesday-Friday (MWF) days.
- There are 2 Tuesday-Thursdays days.

So, the total number of class days in one week = 3 + 2 = 5 days.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of class hours per MWF week.
- Each MWF day consists of 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per MWF week = 3 * 1 = 3 hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of class hours per TTh week.
- Each TTh day consists of 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the total number of hours per TTh week = 2 * 2 = 4 hours.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of class hours for the entire semester.
- The semester is 16 weeks long.
- So, the total number of class hours for the semester = (Number of MWF weeks * Hours per MWF week) + (Number of TTh weeks * Hours per TTh week).
- Number of MWF weeks = 16 / 3 ≈ 5.33 (rounding up to 6 since we can't have a fraction of a week).
- Number of TTh weeks = 16 - 6 = 10.

So,
Total hours for MWF weeks = 6 * 3 = 18 hours.
Total hours for TTh weeks = 10 * 4 = 40 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends on classes in one semester is **18 + 40 = 58** hours.<|im_end|>","Kimo spends 3 x 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours in class on any given Monday, Wednesday or Friday.
Each week, he spends 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 hours in class on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
In one semester, he spends 9 x 16 = <<9*16=144>>144 hours in class for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
He spends 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours in class on any given Tuesday or Thursday.
Each week, he spends 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In one semester, he spends 8 x 16 = <<8*16=128>>128 hours in class on Tuesday and Thursday.
In total for one semester, Kimo spends 144 + 128 = <<144+128=272>>272 hours attending classes.

                    question:
                    Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every : day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?

<|im_start|>superior
To determine the total length of all the baked goods when placed end-to-end, we need to calculate the length for each type of item separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the length of the rolls
- Number of rolls: 300
- Length per roll: 4 inches
- Total length of rolls = Number of rolls × Length per roll
\[ \text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 \text{ inches} = 1200 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the length of the chocolate croissants
- Number of chocolate croissants: 120
- Length per croissant: 6 inches
- Total length of croissants = Number of croissants × Length per croissant
\[ \text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 720 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the length of the baguettes
- Number of baguettes: 60
- Length per baguette: 2 feet
- Convert lengths from feet to inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
\[ \text{Length per baguette in inches} = 2 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ inches} \]
- Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes × Length per baguette
\[ \text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 \text{ inches} = 1440 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 4: Sum the lengths of all items
\[ \text{Total length in inches} = \text{Total length of rolls} + \text{Total length of croissants} + \text{Total length of baguettes} \]
\[ \text{Total length in inches} = 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \]

### Step 5: Convert the total length from inches to feet
Since there are 12 inches in a foot,
\[ \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{\text{Total length in inches}}{12} \]
\[ \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

### Final Answer

To determine the total number of bananas needed over two months, we'll calculate the banana requirements for each type of ape separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the bananas required per month for each type of ape:**
   - **Monkeys:** 
     - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
     - Over 2 months, they would require \( 2 \times 200 = 400 \) bananas.

   - **Gorillas:**
     - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
     - Over 2 months, they would require \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) bananas.

   - **Baboons:**
     - Baboons need 100 bananas per month.
     - Over 2 months, they would require \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) bananas.

2. **Sum the total bananas required for all types of apes over 2 months:**
   - Total bananas for monkeys: 400
   - Total bananas for gorillas: 800
   - Total bananas for baboons: 200

   Therefore, the total number of bananas needed is:
   \[
   400 + 800 + 200 = 1400
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**

\[

To determine how much farther one runner ran compared to the other, we need to calculate the total distance each person ran.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Blake's Distance:**
   - Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
   - Each round trip (back and forth) is \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) yards.
   - Total distance for Blake: \( 15 \times 50 = 750 \) yards.

2. **Calculate Kelly's Distance:**
   - Kelly runs from the 40-yard line back to her starting point and then back again.
   - First segment: \( 40 \) yards (to the 40-yard line) + \( 60 \) yards (back to the starting point) = \( 100 \) yards.
   - Second segment: \( 40 \) yards (to the 40-yard line) + \( 60 \) yards (back to the starting point) = \( 100 \) yards.
   - Third segment: \( 40 \) yards (to the 40-yard line) + \( 60 \) yards (back to the starting point) = \( 100 \) yards.
   - Fourth segment: \( 40 \) yards (to the 40-yard line) + \( 60 \) yards (back to the starting point) = \( 100 \) yards.
   - Total distance for Kelly: \( 4 \times 100 = 400 \) yards.

3. **Compare the distances:**
   - Blake’s total distance: \( 750 \) yards.
   - Kelly’s total distance: \( 400 \) yards.

4. **Determine the difference:**
   - Difference in distance: \( 750 - 400 = 350 \) yards.

Therefore, the winner runs 350 yards farther than the loser. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 350 yards.<|im_end|>","Blake runs 200 yards for each back and forth because 100 x 2 = 200

Kelly runs 200 yards at first because 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200
She runs 80 yards each time she does a back and forth to the 40-yard line because 40 x 2 = <<40*2=80>>80
She runs 2720 from these back and forth because 34 x 80 = <<34*80=2720>>2720

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 11 tadpoles in the pond.

2. Suddenly, 6 tadpoles emerge from hiding under a lily pad. This means we subtract these 6 from the total number of tadpoles in the pond.
   - Initial count: 11
   - Subtract (emerged tadpoles): 11 - 6 = 5

3. Now, after some time, 2 more tadpoles hide under a rock. So we need to add these 2 back to our current count.
   - Current count: 5
   - Add (hidden tadpoles): 5 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles that Finn can still see in the pond is 7.

{The final answer is} 7.<|im_end|>","When the hidden tadpoles come out, Finn sees 11 + 6 = <<11+6=17>>17 tadpoles swimming.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the depth of water on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday. Since the depth on Monday is 17 feet, we can calculate the depth on Tuesday as follows:
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \text{Depth on Monday} + 7 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 \]
\[ \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 24 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the depth of water on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we can find the depth on Wednesday by multiplying the depth on Tuesday by two-thirds:
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Depth on Tuesday} \]
\[ \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \]

To determine the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months given an increase in price every two months at a rate of 20%, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial price:**
   The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **Determine the number of price increases over 36 months:**
   Since the price increases every two months, we need to find out how many times this happens in 36 months.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of increases} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate the total percentage increase over 36 months:**
   Each increase is 20% of the previous price. Therefore, the cumulative effect of 18 such increases can be calculated using the formula for compound interest or geometric progression.

   Let \( P_0 = 20 \) (initial price), \( r = 0.20 \) (interest rate per increase), and \( n = 18 \) (number of increases).

   The total factor after 18 increases is:
   
   \[
   \left(1 + r\right)^n = (1 + 0.20)^{18}
   \]
   
   Calculate this value:
   
   \[
   (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 1.2^{18}
   \]
   
   Using a calculator:
   
   \[
   1.2^{18} \approx 47.52
   \]

4. **Apply the total factor to the initial price:**
   Multiply the initial price by the total factor obtained above:
   
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 20 \times 47.52 \approx 950.40

Therefore, the final cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $\boxed{950.40}$.<|im_end|>","When the price of the bag of marble increase by 20%, the price increases by 20/100*20 = $<<20/100*20=4>>4

   - Since one action figure costs $5, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]
   
2. **Calculate the value of a doll**:
   - Using the value of one action figure (\( x = 5 \)), we find the value of a doll:
     \[
     \text{Value of a doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

3. **Determine the value of one red car**:
   - One red car costs $4.

4. **Sum up the total value of all toys**:
   - We have:
     - 5 red cars, each costing $4,
     - 3 action figures, each costing $5,
     - 1 doll, which costs $15.
   - Calculate the total value:
     \[
     \text{Total value} = (5 \times 4) + (3 \times 5) + 15
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 20 + 15 + 15
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total value} = 50

Therefore, the total value of all toys in the room is $50. {The final answer is} 50.<|im_end|>","Three actions figures are worth 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15, as much as the doll.

                    Jackie is trying to decide whether to do , her taxes herself or hire an accountant. If she does the taxes herself, she'll be able to do 3 fewer hours of freelance work, losing $35/hour in missed income. The accountant charges $90.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more money Jackie would earn if she hires an accountant instead of doing her own taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the lost earnings from not being able to do freelance work:**
   - Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour working as a freelancer.

   \[
   \text{Lost Earnings} = 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90 for their services.

3. **Compare the lost earnings with the cost of hiring an accountant:**

   Since the accountant's fee ($90) is less than the lost earnings ($105), it makes sense that Jackie might choose to hire an accountant rather than doing her own taxes.

4. **Calculate the net difference between her earnings without taxes (lost earnings) and hiring an accountant:**

   \[
   \text{Net Difference} = \text{Lost Earnings} - \text{Accountant Fee}
   \]
   
   Substituting the values calculated:

   \[
   \text{Net Difference} = \$105 - \$90 = \$15
   \]

Therefore, Jackie would have $15 more if she hired an accountant to handle her taxes.

**The final answer is:** 
\[
\boxed{\$15}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the total lost revenue if Jackie does her taxes herself: $35/hour * 3 hours = $<<35*3=105>>105

To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans:**
   - Each Spanish flan requires 3 eggs.
   - Therefore, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs required is \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \) eggs.

2. **Determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit given that she gets 9 eggs per time:**
   - Since each babysitting session provides 9 eggs, we need to find out how many sessions are required to get at least 45 eggs.
   - We divide the total number of eggs needed (45) by the number of eggs per session (9): 
     \[
     \frac{45}{9} = 5

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.
   Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This gives us our first equation:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

3. **Sum of their ages in 2 years:**
   The problem states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Therefore, we can write an equation for their ages in 2 years:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]
   Simplify this equation:
   \[
   S + B + 4 = 28
   \]

4. **Substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
   From \( S = 2B \), substitute \( 2B \) for \( S \):
   \[
   2B + B + 4 = 28
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   3B + 4 = 28
   \]

5. **Solve for \( B \):**
   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   \[
   3B = 24
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   B = 8
   \]

6. **Find Seth's age using \( S = 2B \):**
   Since \( B = 8 \):
   \[
   S = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.<|im_end|>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation where x represents Brooke’s age and 2x represents Seth’s age and noting that in two years, the sum of their ages is (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.
Then we add all the values together, 3x + 4 = 28.
And we subtract 4 from each side, 3x +4 - 4 = 28 – 4.
Then we divide each side by 3x/3 = 24/3.
We find that x = <<8=8>>8, or Brooke’s age is 8.
Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many miles Pancho walks in a week based on his walking pattern.

Step 1: Determine the number of days Pancho walks.
- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5 days
- Weekend days (Saturday and Sunday): 2 days

Total days Pancho walks = 5 weekdays + 2 weekend days = 7 days

Step 2: Calculate the total distance walked during weekdays.
- Distance per weekday: 20 miles
- Number of weekdays: 5
- Total distance for weekdays = 20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance walked during weekends.
- Distance per weekend day: 10 miles
- Number of weekend days: 2
- Total distance for weekends = 10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles

Step 4: Add the distances from weekdays and weekends together to get the total weekly distance.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the jacket:**
   - Given that the jacket costs ""three times as much as the hat"".
   - Let \( H \) represent the cost of the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \( 3H \).

2. **Determine the combined cost of the hat and the jacket:**
   - The combined cost of the hat and the jacket is \( H + 3H = 4H \).

3. **Find the cost of the pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket.
   - The average of \( H \) and \( 3H \) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{H + 3H}{2} = \frac{4H}{2} = 2H
     \]

4. **Sum up all components to find the total cost per uniform:**
   - The total cost for one uniform includes the cost of the hat (\( H \)), the jacket (\( 3H \)), and the pants (\( 2H \)).
   - Adding these together gives:
     \[
     H + 3H + 2H = 6H
     \]

5. **Substitute back the value of \( H \):**
   - We know from the given information that the hat costs $25.
   - So, \( H = 25 \).
   - Substitute \( H \) into the equation:

To determine the total number of legs Jake sees at the Museum of Entomology, we need to calculate the legs from each group separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of legs from the spiders.**
- Number of spiders = 80
- Legs per spider = 8
- Total legs from spiders = \( 80 \times 8 \)

\[
= 640 \text{ legs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of legs from the insects.**
- Number of insects = 90
- Legs per insect = 6
- Total legs from insects = \( 90 \times 6 \)

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payments for Jessica's debt.
2. Determine how much Jessica wants to pay (50% more than the total minimum).
3. Convert the annual amount from months to years.

### Step 1: Calculate the total minimum monthly payments
- Student loans: $300/month

Total minimum monthly payments = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000/month

### Step 2: Determine the desired monthly payment
Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the current minimum.

Desired monthly payment = Total minimum monthly payments * 1.5

### Step 3: Convert the annual amount from months to years
Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the annual amount as follows:

Annual amount = Desired monthly payment * 12
= $1500 * 12 = $18000/year

Therefore, Jessica would need to pay **$18000** per year to meet her goal of paying 50% more than the minimum.<|im_end|>","First find the total minimum payment each month: $300/month + $200/month + $500/month = $<<300+200+500=1000>>1000/month
Then multiply that number by 50% to find how much extra Jessica pays each month: $1000/month * .5 = $<<1000*.5=500>>500/month
Add that number to the total minimum payment to find how much Jessica pays per month: $1000/month + $500/month = $<<1000+500=1500>>1500/month
Now multiply that number by the number of months in a year to find Jessica's annual payment: $1500/month * 12 months/year = $<<1500*12=18000>>18,000/year

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how long it will take Billy to prepare all 60 potatoes, we need to consider both the time spent peeling and the time spent cutting them.

1. **Calculate total time per potato:**
   - Time to peel a potato = 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds)
   - Time to cut a potato = 5 seconds

2. **Add these times together:**
   \[
   \text{Total time per potato} = 90 + 5 = 95 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of potatoes:**
   - Number of potatoes = 60

4. **Multiply the total time per potato by the number of potatoes:**
   \[
   \text{Total prep time} = 95 \times 60 = 5700 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time from seconds to hours:**
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour.
   \[
   \frac{5700}{3600} \approx 1.5833 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: approximately 1.5833 hours.<|im_end|>","There are 60 potatoes, and Billy takes a minute and a half to peel each one, or 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes per potato = <<60*1.5=90>>90 minutes.
Billy only takes 5 seconds to cut the potatoes, so it takes 5 seconds * 60 potatoes / 60 seconds per minute = 5 minutes to cut the potatoes.
So it will take him a total of 90 minutes peeling + 5 minutes cutting = <<90+5=95>>95 minutes total prepping the potatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the cost structure:**
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3
   - Cost of sugar per gallon = $2

2. **Calculate the total cost per gallon:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost per gallon} = \$3 (\text{lemons}) + \$2 (\text{sugar}) = \$5
   \]

3. **Determine the revenue from sales:**
   - Revenue per glass = $0.50
   - Number of glasses sold per gallon = 20

4. **Calculate the total revenue per gallon:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue per gallon} = \$0.50 (\text{per glass}) \times 20 (\text{glasses}) = \$10
   \]

5. **Calculate the profit per gallon:**
   \[
   \text{Profit per gallon} = \text{Revenue per gallon} - \text{Cost per gallon} = \$10 - \$5 = \$5
   \]

6. **Determine the number of gallons made to achieve $25 profit:**
   \[
   \text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\$25}{\$5 (\text{profit per gallon})} = 5 \text{ gallons}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total cost for all the gallons:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = \$5 \times 5 = \$25
   \]

8. **Find out how much was spent on lemons:**
   - Total cost = $25 (as calculated above)
   - Total cost excluding lemons = $25 (total cost) - $3 (cost of lemons per gallon × number of gallons)

Let's calculate the exact amount spent on lemons:
\[
\text{Amount spent on lemons} = \$3 (\text{cost per gallon}) \times \text{number of gallons} = \$3 \times 5 = \$15

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps: calculate Zaid's initial expenses, determine how much remains after those expenses, then subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife, and finally, find out how much money he has left.

### Step 1: Calculate Zaid's Salary Distribution
Zaid earns $6000 per month.

#### Rent
Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary on rent.
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

#### Car Fuel
Zaid spends \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary on car fuel.
\[
\text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Money After Expenses
Subtract the rent and car fuel from his total earnings.
\[
\text{Remaining after rent and car fuel} = 6000 - (1500 + 2000) = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Donations Made to Charity
Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]
After making the donation, the remaining money is:
\[
2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife
Zaid gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife.
\[
\text{Total given away} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Calculation
Subtract the total amount given away from the remaining money.
\[
\text{Final amount left} = 1250 - 900 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, after all expenses and donations, Zaid will still have **$350**.<|im_end|>","When Zaid spend 1/4 of his salary on rent, he parts with 1/4*$6000 = $<<1/4*6000=1500>>1500

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crabs each person has based on the information given and then find the total number of crabs they all have together.

Step 1: Determine how many crabs Monic has.
- We know that Bo has 40 crabs.
- According to the problem, Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Therefore, Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 crams.

Step 2: Determine how many crabs Rani has.
- The problem states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
- Therefore, Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46 crams.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs.
- Bo has 40 crams.
- Monic has 36 crams.
- Rani has 46 crams.
- To find the total, add these numbers together:

\[ \text{Total crabs} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Now let's do the addition:

\[ 40 + 36 = 76 \]
\[ 76 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is **122**.<|im_end|>","If Bo has 40 crabs, then Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, has 40-4 = <<40-4=36>>36 crabs.

Since Monic has 36 crabs, Rani's number of crabs is 36+ 10 = <<36+10=46>>46.
Together, the three have 76+46 = <<76+46=122>>122 crabs.

To determine how much Lloyd earned over the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings from each week separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first week**
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.

\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} \]
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \$10 \times 5 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for the first week} = \$50 \]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for the second week**
- Similarly, Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
- He tutored for 8 hours in the second week.

\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} \]
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \$10 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for the second week} = \$80 \]

**Step 3: Sum the earnings from both weeks**

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week} \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$50 + \$80 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$130 \]

1. **Calculate the total number of votes:**
   - The total number of students who voted is given as 80.

2. **Determine the fraction of votes received by the winner:**
   - According to the problem, the winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.

3. **Calculate the number of votes for the winner:**
   - To find out how many votes the winner got, we multiply the total number of votes (80) by the fraction (\( \frac{3}{4} \)).

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of red roses Sandra needs to receive by 5 PM so that she can avoid switching suppliers. Let's break down the information given:

1. **White Carnations**: Sandra orders twice as many white carnations as red roses.
2. **Pink Calla Lilies**: There are 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.
3. **Total Pink Calla Lilies**: This is equal to the number of white carnations.

Let's start solving for the number of white carnations first:

- Since there are 200 pink calla lilies and they represent five times the number of white carnations,
\[ \text{Number of White Carnations} = \frac{\text{Number of Pink Calla Lilies}}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of red roses based on the relationship between red roses and white carnations:
\[ \text{Red Roses} = 2 \times \text{White Carnations} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

Therefore, Sandra needs 80 red roses by 5 PM in order to avoid switching suppliers. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 80 red roses.<|im_end|>","Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies / 5 = <<200/5=40>>40 white carnations.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine Mark's current age.
2. Use Mark's age to find Jan's age.
3. Calculate Jean's age based on the relationship between Jean and Mark.

Step 1: Determine Mark's current age.
Given that Mark is 5 years older than half of Jan's age, and Jan is 30 years old, we can set up the equation for Mark's age:

\[ \text{Mark's Age} = \frac{\text{Jan's Age}}{2} + 5 \]

Substituting Jan's age (30) into the equation:

\[ \text{Mark's Age} = \frac{30}{2} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Mark's Age} = 15 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Mark's Age} = 20 \]

So, Mark is currently 20 years old.

Step 2: Use Mark's age to find Jan's age.
We know that Mark is 5 years older than half of Jan's age. We already calculated that Jan is 30 years old.

Let \( J \) be Jean's age. According to the given information, Mark's age should also equal \( \frac{J}{2} + 5 \):

\[ 20 = \frac{J}{2} + 5 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ 20 - 5 = \frac{J}{2} \]
\[ 15 = \frac{J}{2} \]
\[ J = 15 \times 2 \]
\[ J = 30 \]

Therefore, Jean is 30 years old.

Final Answer: The final answer is Jean is 30 years old.<|im_end|>","2 years ago Jan was 30-2=<<30-2=28>>28 years old

To determine how much time the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time for both teams to complete the race.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Total Time for the Faster Team:**
   - Each member runs exactly 55 seconds.
   - There are four runners on the team.
   - Therefore, the total time for the faster team is \( 55 \text{ seconds/runner} \times 4 \text{ runners} = 220 \text{ seconds} \).

2. **Calculate Total Time for the Less Well-Rounded Team:**
   - The first runner takes 60 seconds.
   - Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster.
   
   Let's break it down:
   - First runner (time = 60 seconds).
   - Second runner (time = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds).
   - Third runner (time = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds).
   - Fourth runner (time = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds).

   Now, sum these times to get the total time for the slower team:
   \[
   60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **Determine the Difference in Winning Time:**
   - The faster team completes the race in 220 seconds.
   - The slower team completes the race in 222 seconds.
   - The difference in winning time is:
     \[
     222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The faster team wins by **2 seconds**.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The first team will finish the relay in 4*55 = <<4*55=220>>220 seconds.
On the second team we must determine each runner's individual pace. We know the first runner will complete their leg in 60 seconds, so the second runner will take 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, then the third will take 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth will take 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
Thus, the second team will finish the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = <<60+57+54+51=222>>222 seconds.
Therefore, the first team will finish 222 - 220 = <<222-220=2>>2 seconds faster than the second team.

                    question:
                    Jerry is : rolling a six-sided die. How much more likely is it (expressed as a percentage) . that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even ? numbers in a row?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities for two different scenarios: rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die and rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
A six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die.
An even number on a six-sided die can be either 2 or 4. So, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{even}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Since the events are independent, the combined probability of both events happening is:

\[ P(\text{two even numbers in a row}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{1}{9} \]

### Step 3: Compare the two probabilities.
Now, let's compare the probabilities calculated above:

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: \( \frac{1}{9} \)

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we use the formula for relative frequency:

\[ \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\text{Probability of event A}}{\text{Probability of event B}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Relative Frequency} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{9}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{9}{1} = \frac{9}{2} \]

Convert this into a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{9}{2} \right) \times 100\% = 450\% \]

Therefore, it is **450%** more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. 

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on the dice, so the chances of rolling one of them are 3 / 6 = 50%.
The chance of rolling one even number is 50%, so the chance of rolling two in a row is 50% * 50% = 25%.
The difference between these two probabilities is 50% - 25% = 25%.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the information provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw for the rats is \( 6R \).

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed for hamsters:**
   - Let \( H \) be the number of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw for the hamsters is \( 5H \).

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed for rabbits:**
   - There are 20 pieces of straw distributed for the rabbits.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 160.
   - So, we can write the equation as:
     \[
     6R + 5H + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( R \) and \( H \):
     \[
     6R + 5H = 140
     \]

6. **Express \( H \) in terms of \( R \):**
   - Solve for \( H \):
     \[
     H = \frac{140 - 6R}{5}
     \]
   - Since \( H \) must be an integer (because it represents the number of hamsters), \( 140 - 6R \) must be divisible by 5.

7. **Find possible values of \( R \):**
   - We know that \( R \) must be such that \( 140 - 6R \) is divisible by 5.
   - Check multiples of 5 within the range of possible values for \( R \):

   - For \( R = 1 \):
     \[
     140 - 6(1) = 134 \quad (\text{not divisible by } 5)
     \]
   - For \( R = 2 \):
     \[
     140 - 6(2) = 128 \quad (\text{not divisible by } 5)
     \]
   - For \( R = 3 \):
     \[
     140 - 6(3) = 122 \quad (\text{not divisible by } 5)
     \]
   - For \( R = 4 \):
     \[
     140 - 6(4) = 116 \quad (\text{not divisible by } 5)
     \]
   - For \( R = 5 \):
     \[
     140 - 6(5) = 110 \quad (\text{divisible by } 5)
     \]
     - This gives us \( H = \frac{110}{5} = 22 \).

8. **Verify the solution:**
   - With \( R = 5 \) and \( H = 22 \):
     \[
     6(5) + 5(22) + 20 = 30 + 110 + 20 = 160
     \]
     - The total matches the given distribution.

9. **Determine the number of rats per cage:**
   - There are 10 cages of rats.
   - Therefore, the number of rats per cage is:
     \[
     \frac{10}{x} \quad \text{(where \( x \) is the number of rats per cage)}
     \]
     - From our previous calculation, \( x = 5 \).

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\).<|im_end|>","In the hamster cages, there are 10 cages * 5 pieces of straw per hamster cage = <<10*5=50>>50 pieces of straw.
Between the rabbits and the hamsters, there are 50 pieces of straw for hamsters + 20 pieces of straw for rabbits = <<50+20=70>>70 pieces of straw.
As the remaining straw is for the rats, the rats have a total of 160 used pieces of straw – 70 pieces of straw for the hamsters and rabbits = 90 pieces of straws.
So in each cage, there are 90 pieces of straw / 3 cages = <<90/3=30>>30 pieces of straw.
This means that each cage has 30 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw per rat = <<30/6=5>>5 rats.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount owed including interest over three months**

Given that there is an annual interest rate of 2%, we need to find out what 2% of $100 would be.

Interest per month = (Total debt) * (Monthly interest rate)
Interest per month = $100 * 2%
Interest per month = $100 * 0.02
Interest per month = $2

Since there are 3 months in the period, the total interest accumulated over 3 months will be:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Interest per month} \times \text{Number of months} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$2 \times 3 \]

Now calculate the total interest:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \$6 \]

**Step 2: Add the total interest to the principal sum**

Mandy originally owed $100, so her total payment needs to include both the original amount and the accrued interest.
\[ \text{Total Payment} = \text{Original Amount} + \text{Total Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Payment} = \$100 + \$6 \]

Calculate the total payment:
\[ \text{Total Payment} = \$106 \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: $106.<|im_end|>","The monthly interest is $100 x 2/100 = $<<100*2/100=2>>2.
After 3 months, the total interest amount to $2 x 3 = $<<2*3=6>>6.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict a total of $100 + $6 = $<<100+6=106>>106.

To solve this problem, we need to break down the given information and use algebra to find out how many bags of wheat were sold.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of bags of wheat bought.
   
2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - The cost of buying \( x \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag is \( 20x \).
   - The transportation cost for \( x \) bags is $2 per bag, so the total transportation cost is \( 2x \).

3. **Total Cost:**
   The total cost for the trader before selling the bags is the sum of these two costs:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 20x + 2x = 22x
   \]

4. **Selling Revenue:**
   - The selling price for each bag is $30.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling \( x \) bags is \( 30x \).

5. **Profit Calculation:**
   The profit is calculated as the difference between the revenue and the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   400 = 30x - (22x)
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   400 = 30x - 22x
   \]
   \[
   400 = 8x
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{400}{8}

   - The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets.
   - Therefore, the cost per ticket is \( \frac{20.25}{3} = 6.75 \).

2. **Determine the total amount spent on food:**
   - They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
   - So, the total amount spent on food is \( 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rides:**
   - Each ride costs $33, and there are 2 rides.
   - So, the total cost of the rides is \( 33 \times 2 = 66 \).

4. **Sum up all the expenses:**
   - Total cost of tickets: $20.25
   - Cost of food: $15.75
   - Total cost of rides: $66
   - Therefore, the total expense is \( 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \).

5. **Divide the total expense by the number of people:**
   - There are 3 people splitting the total cost.
   - Each person should pay \( \frac{102}{3} = 34 \).

So, each of them pays $34.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $34.<|im_end|>","They spent $20.25 - $4.50 = $<<20.25-4.5=15.75>>15.75 on food.

To determine the total number of pounds of insects needed per day for a flock of ten ducks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly insect consumption for one duck:**
   - Each duck eats 3.5 pounds of insects each week.

2. **Calculate the daily insect consumption for one duck:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the daily insect consumption for one duck is \( \frac{3.5}{7} \) pounds.

                    question:
                    , Tom plants 10 trees a year.  Every year he ; also chops down 2 trees a year.  He starts with 50 trees.  After 10 years . 30% of the trees die.  How many trees does he ? have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the net change in tree population per year**

Tom plants 10 trees annually but chops down 2 trees annually.

Net change per year = (Number of planted trees - Number chopped)  
= (10 - 2)  
= 8 trees

So, after one year, the number of trees increases by 8.

**Step 2: Determine the total increase over 10 years**

Since the net increase per year is 8 trees, over 10 years, the total increase would be:

Total increase over 10 years = Net increase per year * Number of years  
= 8 trees/year * 10 years  
= 80 trees

This means that after 10 years, Tom has increased his tree population from 50 to 130 trees.

**Step 3: Account for the death rate**

After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, we calculate how many trees will die and subtract them from the current total.

Percentage of trees dying = 30%
Number of trees dying = Total trees before accounting for deaths * Percentage dying  
= 130 trees * 0.3  
= 39 trees

Therefore, after accounting for the deaths, the remaining number of trees is:

Remaining trees = Current total - Trees dying

                    Sue ? lives in a fun neighborhood.  One weekend, the neighbors decided to play a prank on Sue.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps provided and keep track of the number of pink and white flamingos at different points in time.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Initial Placement on Friday Morning:**
   - The neighbors place 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.
   - Number of pink flamingos = 18

2. **Taking Back Flamingos on Saturday Morning:**
   - They take back one-third of the flamingos.
   - Total flamingos initially = 18
   - Number of flamingos taken back = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \)
   - Number of flamingos left after taking some back = \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)

3. **Painting and Replacing on Saturday:**
   - They paint the remaining 6 flamingos white.
   - Number of white flamingos = 6

4. **Adding More Pink Flamingos on Sunday Morning:**
   - They add another 18 pink plastic flamingos.
   - Number of pink flamingos now = 18 (initial) + 18 (added) = 36

5. **At Noon on Sunday:**
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos are there than white flamingos.
   - Number of pink flamingos = 36
   - Number of white flamingos = 6
   - Difference between pink and white flamingos = \( 36 - 6 = 30 \)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are **30 more pink plastic flamingos** than white ones.<|im_end|>","On Saturday, one third of the original 18 pink flamingos were removed and painted white: 18*1/3=<<18*1/3=6>>6 white flamingos.
This left 18 pink - 6 = <<18-6=12>>12 pink flamingos.
On Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added, for a total of 12 + 18 = <<12+18=30>>30 pink flamingos on the front lawn.
Altogether, there were 30 pink and 6 white flamingos on the lawn, so there were 30 pink - 6 white =<<30-6=24>>24 more pink flamingos.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost for 8 pens based on the given information about their individual costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Cost of One Pen:**
   - We know that one pencil costs $1.20.
   - The cost of an eraser is $0.30.
   - According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the sum of the cost of one pencil and one eraser.
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pencil} + \text{Cost of one eraser}
   \]
   
   Substituting the given values:
   
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = \$1.20 + \$0.30 = \$1.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Cost for 8 Pens:**
   - Now that we know one pen costs $1.50, we can calculate the total cost for 8 pens by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 8 \times (\text{Cost of one pen})
   \]
   
   Substituting the value calculated in the previous step:
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12.00
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$12.00}
\]<|im_end|>","A pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $<<1.20+0.30=1.50>>1.50.

1. Determine how many pounds of carrots each restaurant receives.
2. Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots received by all 40 restaurants.
3. Subtract the total number of pounds received from the initial amount of carrots available.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Determine how many pounds of carrots each restaurant receives.
Each restaurant is supposed to receive 2 pounds of carrots.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pounds of carrots received by all 40 restaurants.
Since there are 40 restaurants and each gets 2 pounds, the total number of pounds received can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total pounds received} = 2 \times 40 \]

### Calculation:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \]
So, the total number of pounds of carrots received by all 40 restaurants is 80 pounds.

### Step 3: Subtract the total number of pounds received from the initial amount of carrots available.
We start with 200 pounds of carrots and subtract the 80 pounds that were actually received:
\[ \text{Pounds left over} = 200 - 80 \]

### Calculation:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]

To determine how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we will break down her collection process step by step.

1. **Initial Collection:**
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.
   
   \[
   \text{Cards at start} = 20
   \]

2. **First Month Collection:**
   She collects three times the initial amount.
   
   \[
   \text{Cards after first month} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]
   
   Adding these to her initial amount:

   \[
   \text{Total after first month} = 20 + 60 = 80
   \]

3. **Second Month Collection:**
   She collects 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   
   \[
   \text{Cards after second month} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   
   Adding these to her previous total:

   \[
   \text{Total after second month} = 80 + 40 = 120
   \]

4. **Third Month Collection:**
   She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   
   First, calculate the combined total from the first two months:
   
   \[
   \text{Combined total} = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]
   
   Then, collect twice this amount:
   
   \[
   \text{Cards after third month} = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]
   
   Adding these to her previous total:

   \[

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher.
2. Calculate the earnings from Publisher A.
3. Calculate the earnings from Publisher B (which is twice as much as Publisher A).
4. Sum up the earnings from both publishers.

Step 1: Determine how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher.

Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week and he edits an equal number from each publisher, we divide the total number of sentences by 2.

\[
\text{Number of sentences from each publisher} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
\]

Step 2: Calculate the earnings from Publisher A.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. So, the earnings from Publisher A can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
\]

Step 3: Calculate the earnings from Publisher B.

Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark \(2 \times 5\) cents per sentence. The earnings from Publisher B can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 500 \times 2 \times 5 = 5000 \text{ cents}
\]

Step 4: Sum up the earnings from both publishers.

Now, we add the earnings from both publishers to get the total amount Mark makes in a week.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7500 \text{ cents}}
\]<|im_end|>","Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each of them.

Since Publisher B pays Mark twice as much, he earns 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 cents per sentence from Publisher B.
Thus, he earns 10 cents per sentence * 500 sentences = <<10*500=5000>>5000 cents from publisher B.

<|im_start|>user

To determine how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and his annual raise from his salary. Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total one-time reward
John receives a one-time reward of $5000.

### Step 2: Determine John's new salary after receiving the award
John gets a 5% raise on his current weekly salary of $2000. To find out his new salary, we calculate:

\[ \text{New Salary} = \text{Current Salary} + (\text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{New Salary} = \$2000 + (\$2000 \times 0.05) \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = \$2000 + \$100 \]
\[ \text{New Salary} = \$2100 \]

So, John’s new salary for the year is $2100 per week.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount John earned over the course of the year
John works all 52 weeks of the year at his new salary of $2100 per week.

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$2100 \times 52 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$11,2200 \]

Therefore, John made a total of **$11,2200** during the year.<|im_end|>","He makes 2000*52=$<<2000*52=104000>>104,000 a year

To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of grapes produced annually**
- Josie has 10 acres.
- Each acre produces 5 tons of grapes.

\[
\text{Total grapes} = \text{Number of acres} \times \text{Grapes per acre}
\]

\[
\text{Total grapes} = 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons}
\]

**Step 2: Convert the total grapes into wine barrels**
- Each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine.

\[
\text{Total wine barrels} = \text{Total grapes} \times \text{Wine barrels per ton}
\]

\[
\text{Total wine barrels} = 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels}

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many slices of cheese Carl used throughout the week, we need to break down his consumption into different types of dishes:

1. **Sandwiches**:
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices.
   - Carl eats sandwiches every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total slices from sandwiches = \(2 \times 7 = 14\).

2. **Cheese and Egg Omelets**:
   - Carl eats 3 days a week, using one more slice per omelet than he does per sandwich (which is 2).
   - So, each omelet uses 2 + 1 = 3 slices.
   - Since there are 3 days a week, total slices from omelets = \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. **Macaroni and Cheese**:
   - The big dish contains 8 slices.

Now, let's sum up all the slices:

- Sandwiches: 14 slices
- Omelets: 9 slices
- Macaroni and Cheese: 8 slices

Total number of slices used = \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\).

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 31 slices of cheese.<|im_end|>","His 2-slice sandwiches used 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 slices of cheese for all 7 days of the week.
His cheese and egg omelets used one more slice than his sandwiches, so they used 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 slices of cheese each.
He made 3 omelets, so they used 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 slices of cheese.
Carl’s sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni used 14 + 9 + 8 = <<14+9+8=31>>31 slices of cheese in all.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pens Janet has after buying more pens. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of pens
- **Green Pens**: Janet initially has 22 green pens.
- **Yellow Pens**: Janet initially has 10 yellow pens.

Total initial pens = Green pens + Yellow pens
= 22 + 10 = 32 pens

### Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens added
- Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens.
- Each bag contains 9 blue pens.

Number of blue pens added = Number of bags × Number of blue pens per bag
= 6 × 9 = 54 blue pens

### Step 3: Calculate the number of red pens added
- Janet bought 2 bags of red pens.
- Each bag contains 6 red pens.

Number of red pens added = Number of bags × Number of red pens per bag
= 2 × 6 = 12 red pens

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pens
- Total pens from green pens = 22
- Total pens from yellow pens = 10
- Total pens from blue pens = 54
- Total pens from red pens = 12

Total pens = Green pens + Yellow pens + Blue pens + Red pens
= 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 100 pens

Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 100. 

{The final answer is} 100 pens.<|im_end|>","Janet previously had 22 + 10 = <<22+10=32>>32 pens.
The number of blue pens is 6 × 9 = <<6*9=54>>54.

                    question:
                    Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. Mr. Bert gives six tests , each semester. He allows the students to remove the lowest score from the average each semester. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100 and 86 on the first five tests, what score does she need on the sixth test to get an average of 93?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of tests (including the sixth):**
   \[
   5 \text{ tests} + 1 \text{ test for the sixth one}
   \]
   So, there will be \(6\) tests.

3. **Set up the equation for the desired average:**
   The average score over all six tests should be 93.
   \[
   \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} = 93
   \]

4. **Express the total sum of scores as \(S\):**
   \[
   S = 93 \times 6
   \]

5. **Substitute the known values into the equation:**
   \[
   S = 93 \times 6
   \]

6. **Calculate the total sum required to achieve this average:**
   \[
   S = 558
   \]

7. **Find the total score needed after removing the lowest score:**
   Subtract the lowest score (which is 71) from the total sum calculated above:
   \[
   558 - 71 = 487
   \]

8. **Add the score of the sixth test to find the minimum score needed:**
   Let \(x\) be the score on the sixth test. Then,
   \[
   x + 487 = 558
   \]

9. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 558 - 487
   \]
   \[
   x = 71
   \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of **71** on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.<|im_end|>","First, identify the lowest score, which is 71, and remove it.
Since Brinley wants a score of 93, we know her total score needs to be 93 (average) * 5 (tests) = <<93*5=465>>465 points
So far, Brinley has earned 89 + 92 +100 + 86 = <<89+92+100+86=367>>367 points
The final test must be 465 - 367 = <<465-367=98>>98 points.

                    Micheal loves riding a ? bike. He rode it at least 5 times a week and makes 25 kilometers each time. He did that for four weeks, and ! then he decided, to ride the bike only 2 times a week, but ! for 60 kilometers each time, and he did that for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Micheal do in ? total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Michael covered over two different periods: when he rides his bike regularly and when he rides less frequently.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance Michael covers during the regular period (when he rides at least 5 times a week):**
   - He rides 5 times a week.
   - Each time, he rides 25 kilometers.
   
   \[
   \text{Distance per trip} = 25 \text{ km}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of trips per week} = 5
   \]

   Therefore, the total distance for one week:

   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 5 \times 25 \text{ km} = 125 \text{ km}
   \]

   Over 4 weeks:

   \[
   \text{Total distance for 4 weeks} = 125 \text{ km/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance Michael covers during the reduced period (when he rides 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time):**
   - He rides 2 times a week.
   - Each time, he rides 60 kilometers.
   
   \[
   \text{Distance per trip} = 60 \text{ km}
   \]
   
   \[
   \text{Number of trips per week} = 2
   \]

   Therefore, the total distance for one week:

   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 2 \times 60 \text{ km} = 120 \text{ km}
   \]

   Over 3 weeks:

   \[
   \text{Total distance for 3 weeks} = 120 \text{ km/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Add the distances from both periods together:**

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = 860 \text{ km}
   \]

### Conclusion:

Micheal did a total of 860 kilometers.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{860 \text{ km}}
\]<|im_end|>","In the first part, Micheal did 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 kilometers every week.
He did that for four weeks, which means he made during that time 125 * 4 = <<125*4=500>>500 kilometers.
After that, he made 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 kilometers a week.
And Micheal did that for three weeks, so he rode 120 * 3 = <<120*3=360>>360 kilometers during that time.
In total Micheal did 500 + 360 = <<500+360=860>>860 kilometers.

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to consider both the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples.

1. **Calculate the weight of one chocolate bar**:
   - We know that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.
   
2. **Calculate the total weight of all chocolate bars**:
   - There are 25 chocolate bars.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the chocolate bars = \(25 \times 40\) grams.

3. **Calculate the weight of one candied apple**:
   - The weight of each candied apple is not given directly but can be inferred from the information provided about the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can deduce that if each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then each candied apple must weigh half of that (because it’s the same amount of 'weight' per unit length or volume).

4. **Calculate the total weight of all candied apples**:
   - There are 80 candied apples.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the candied apples = \(80 \times \text{weight of one candied apple}\).
   - Given that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, we can infer that each candied apple also weighs 40 grams because they have the same 'weight' represented by their physical form.

5. **Sum up the weights**:
   - Total weight of chocolate bars = \(25 \times 40\)
   - Total weight of candied apples = \(80 \times 40\)

6. **Add the two totals together**:
   - Total weight of candy = \(25 \times 40 + 80 \times 40\)

Now let's perform these calculations:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \]
\[ 80 \times 40 = 3200 \]

Adding these together gives us:

\[ 1000 + 3200 = 4200 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 4200 grams.<|im_end|>","The candied apples weigh 40/2=<<40/2=20>>20 grams each.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days.

1. **First Day:**
   - Rose bought 4 cakes.

   - Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on the first day.
   - Number of cakes on the second day = \(3 \times 4\)
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( C \) be the cost of one plate.

Given that half a dozen plates (i.e., 6 plates) cost $6000 each:
\[ 6C = 6000 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{6000}{6} = 1000 \]

So, the cost of one plate is $1000.

### Step 2: Express Cost of Cups
We're told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.

First, calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dozens} \]
Since one dozen equals 12, we convert to individual units:
\[ 240 \times 12 = 2880 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let \( x \) be the cost per cup. The total cost of 2880 cups would then be:
\[ 2880x \]

According to the given information, this should be $1200 more than the cost of half a dozen plates ($6000):
\[ 2880x = 6000 + 1200 \]

Simplify the right side:
\[ 2880x = 7200 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 2880 to find the cost per cup:
\[ x = \frac{7200}{2880} \]

Simplify:
\[ x = \frac{7200 \div 240}{2880 \div 240} = \frac{30}{12} = 2.5 \]

Therefore, the cost per cup is $2.5.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$2.5}
\]<|im_end|>","Since a dozen has 12 items, half a dozen plates are 12/2 = <<6=6>>6
Half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each cost 6*$6000 = $<<6*6000=36000>>36000
Twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, meaning the twenty dozen cups cost a total of $36000-$1200 = 34800
Since a dozen has 12 items, twenty dozen cups are 20*12 = <<20*12=240>>240 cups.
If the twenty dozen cups cost $34800, each cup costs $34800/240=$<<34800/240=145>>145

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy.
- Jacket: $30
- Two pairs of shoes: $20 × 2 = $40

Total cost = $30 + $40 = $70

### Step 2: Determine how much money Sara earns from babysitting.
Sara earns $5 per session babysitting.

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from babysitting over several sessions.
Let \( n \) be the number of times Sara needs to babysit for her parents to earn enough money.

Earnings from babysitting = $5 × n

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings from mowing lawns.
Sara earns $4 per lawn mowed.

If she mows the lawn \( x \) times, her earnings will be \( 4x \).

### Step 5: Set up an equation based on the total earnings needed to cover both purchases.
From babysitting:
\[ 5n \]

From mowing lawns:
\[ 4x \]

Total earnings should equal or exceed the $70 needed for the jacket and shoes:
\[ 5n + 4x \geq 70 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( n \).
Since we don't know \( x \), we need to find the minimum \( n \) that satisfies the inequality above.

For simplicity, let's assume \( x = 1 \):
\[ 5n + 4(1) \geq 70 \]
\[ 5n + 4 \geq 70 \]
\[ 5n \geq 66 \]
\[ n \geq 13.2 \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer (she can't babysit a fraction of a session), we round up to the next whole number:
\[ n = 14 \]

### Conclusion:
Sara must babysit for 14 sessions with her parents to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 14.<|im_end|>","Both pairs of shoes will cost a total of 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

- White chickens: \( w = r + 2 \)

Next, let's write an equation for the total number of eggs collected per day:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substitute \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify inside the parentheses:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term with \( r \):
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has **4** red chickens.<|im_end|>","First, set up the equation for the number of eggs the chickens lay each day: 3r + 5w = 42, where r is the number of red chickens and w is the number of white chickens.
Then, express r in terms of w based on the information in the problem: w = r + <<+2=2>>2
Now substitute r + 2 for w in the equation for the number of eggs: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32
Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get r = 4

                    question:
                    : Gary likes to walk . around the edge of the local park, which : is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at 3 miles/hour, how many hours does he spend walking?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long Gary spends walking, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park:**
   The park is a rectangle with dimensions 1.5 miles (length) and 6 miles (width). The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6)
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses first:
   \[
   P = 2 \times 7.5
   \]
   Then multiply:
   \[
   P = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Gary takes to walk the perimeter:**
   Gary's walking speed is 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}}
   \]
   Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Gary spends **5 hours** walking around the park.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the two long sides of the park: 6 miles * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 miles

Then add those two lengthes to find the total distance around the park: 12 miles + 3 miles = <<12+3=15>>15 miles
Then divide the total length by Gary's speed to find how long he spends walking: 15 miles / 3 miles/hour = <<15/3=5>>5 hours

   - On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day.

   \[
   \text{Number of customers on the second day} = 100 + 50 = 150

                    question:
                    Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them ? out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water ! as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B \) be the current volume of water in the big pool.
   Let \( S \) be the current volume of water in the small pool.

2. **Understand the Leaks:**
   Both pools leak water at the same rate (4 gallons per minute).

3. **Time Interval:**
   The time interval given is 4 minutes.

4. **Big Pool Leak Calculation:**
   - In 4 minutes, the big pool will lose \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons due to its leak.
   
5. **Small Pool Leak Calculation:**
   - Since there are no leaks mentioned for the small pool, the small pool remains unchanged during this period.

6. **Relation Between Pools Before 4 Minutes Ago:**
   According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
   So, if we denote the amount of water in the small pool before 4 minutes ago as \( S_0 \), then:
   \[
   B_{\text{before}} = 2S_0
   \]
   where \( B_{\text{before}} \) is the volume of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

7. **Volume Change Over Time:**
   After 4 minutes, the big pool's volume changes from \( B_{\text{before}} \) to \( B \).
   This change is due to the leak, so:
   \[
   B = B_{\text{before}} - 16
   \]

8. **Volume Change Relation:**
   The small pool remains unchanged, so:
   \[
   S = S_0
   \]

9. **Water Volume Equations:**
   We can set up equations based on the volumes after 4 minutes:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]
   and
   \[
   S = S_0
   \]

10. **Substitute and Solve:**
    Substitute \( S \) into the equation for \( B \):
    \[
    B = 2(S)
    \]
    From the leak calculation:
    \[
    B = B_{\text{before}} - 16
    \]
    Using the relation between the volumes:
    \[
    B_{\text{before}} = 2S_0
    \]
    Therefore,
    \[
    B = 2S_0 - 16
    \]

11. **Combine Equations:**
    Set the two expressions for \( B \) equal:
    \[
    2S = 2S_0 - 16
    \]

12. **Solve for \( S \):**
    Simplify the equation:
    \[
    2S + 16 = 2S_0
    \]
    Divide both sides by 2:
    \[
    S + 8 = S_0
    \]
    Rearrange to find \( S_0 \):
    \[
    S_0 = S + 8
    \]

13. **Find \( B \) using \( B = 2S \):**
    Substituting back into \( B = 2S \):
    \[
    B = 2S
    \]
    Given that \( B \) was also expressed as \( B = 2S_0 - 16 \):
    \[
    2S = 2(S_0 - 8)
    \]
    Simplifying further:
    \[
    S = S_0 - 8
    \]

14. **Final Answer:**
    To find the exact value of \( S \), substitute \( S = S_0 - 8 \) into either expression:
    \[
    B = 2(S_0 - 8)
    \]
    But since \( B = 2S \), substituting gives:
    \[
    2S = 2(S_0 - 8)
    \]
    Simplifying:
    \[
    S = S_0 - 8
    \]

Given these steps, the final answer for the volume of water in the small pool now is:
\[
\boxed{S}

Let b be the amount of water the big pool has now and s be the amount of water the small pool has. We know that b = 4s, and b + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4s + 16 = 2(s + 16)
Multiplying through the parentheses, we get 4s + 16 = 2s + 32
Subtracting 2s from both sides, we get 2s + 16 = 32
Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get 2s = 16

   - Cost of the belt: $32.00
   - Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

2. **Determine the amount Lori earns per hour at her part-time job:**
   - Earnings per hour: $8.00

3. **Calculate the number of hours required to earn $352.00:**
   - Number of hours = Total cost / Hourly wage
   - Number of hours = $352.00 / $8.00 = 46 hours

Therefore, Lori will need to work for **46 hours** before she can afford both the shoes and the belt.

{The final answer is} 46 hours.<|im_end|>","She wants to buy a pair of shoes for $320.00 and a belt for $32.00 for a total of 320+32 = $<<320+32=352.00>>352.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay.
Janeth borrowed $2000 and promises to add an additional 10% of the borrowed amount as interest.

\[ \text{Interest} = 2000 \times \frac{10}{100} = 2000 \times 0.1 = 200 \]

So, the total amount Janeth needs to repay is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

### Step 2: Determine the monthly payment.
Janeth is going to pay $165 per month for 12 months.

Total amount paid over 12 months:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the total payments from the total amount owed.
Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount Janeth owes.

Remaining balance after 12 months:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after paying $165 per month for 12 months is **$220**.<|im_end|>","Janeth will pay an additional $2000x 10/100 =$<<2000*10/100=200>>200.

Janeth will be able to pay off $165 x 12 = $<<165*12=1980>>1980 in 12 months.
Hence, her remaining balance by then will be $2200 - $1980 = $<<2200-1980=220>>220.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Harriet's current age
We know that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

### Step 2: Determine Adrian's current age
Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. So,
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} \]
Substituting Harriet's age,
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

### Step 3: Determine Zack's current age
Harriet's age is half the age of Zack. Therefore,
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} \]
Substituting Harriet's age,
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

### Step 4: Calculate their ages in three years
After three years, their ages will increase as follows:
- Harriet's age after three years: \( 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Adrian's age after three years: \( 63 + 3 = 66 \)
- Zack's age after three years: \( 42 + 3 = 45 \)

### Step 5: Calculate the total sum of their ages after three years
\[ \text{Total sum of ages} = \text{Harriet's age after 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age after 3 years} + \text{Zack's age after 3 years} \]
\[ \text{Total sum of ages} = 24 + 66 + 45 \]

### Step 6: Find the average age
The average age is calculated by dividing the total sum of their ages by 3 (since there are three people).
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total sum of ages}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} \]

### Final Calculation
Let's perform the division:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the average age of the three individuals in three years will be **45**.<|im_end|>","In three years, Harriet will be 21+3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.

In three years, he will be 63+3 =<<63+3=66>>66 years old.
If Harriet is half times the age of Zack, Zack is 21*2 = <<21*2=42>>42 years old.
In three years, he will be 42+3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.
The combined age of the three in 3 years will be 45+66+24 = <<45+66+24=135>>135 years.
The average age for the in three years will be 135/3 =<<135/3=45>>45 years

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Jojo scored given that the total points scored by all four students together is 251.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of points scored by Yuri:**
   - Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
   - Naomi's score is 68 points.
   
   First, calculate half of Naomi’s score:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   
   Then add 10 to this value to find Yuri’s score:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of points scored by Brianna:**
   - Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   
   Since Naomi scored 68 points, we can calculate Brianna’s score as follows:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]

3. **Determine the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:**
   - Naomi scored 68 points.
   - Yuri scored 44 points.
   - Brianna scored 85 points.
   
   Sum these values:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]

4. **Calculate the points scored by Jojo:**
   - The total points scored by all four students is 251.
   
   Subtract the sum of points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
   \[
   251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{54}
\]<|im_end|>","Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 1/2 (68) + 10 = 44 points
Brianna scored 68 + 17 = <<68+17=85>>85 points

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Carmen spent on both crosswords and Sudoku puzzles over the weekend.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on crosswords.
- Time per crossword puzzle = 10 minutes
- Number of crossword puzzles = 3

Total time for crosswords = 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on Sudoku puzzles.
- Time per Sudoku puzzle = 5 minutes
- Number of Sudoku puzzles = 8

Total time for Sudoku puzzles = 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Step 3: Add the times from steps 1 and 2 together.

                    question:
                    A water tank is filled with 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden. She was then able to collect ; rainwater that is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are in the tank . now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how much water remains after Celine uses some.
- Initially, there are 120 liters of water in the tank.
- Celine uses 90 liters of water for her garden.

So, the remaining amount of water in the tank:
\[ 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.
- The rainwater collected is twice the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used some.

Therefore, the amount of rainwater collected:
\[ 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Find out the total amount of water in the tank after adding the rainwater.
- After collecting the rainwater, we add this quantity back to the original amount of water left in the tank.

Thus, the total amount of water in the tank:
\[ 30 \text{ liters (remaining)} + 60 \text{ liters (rainwater)} = 90 \text{ liters} \]

### Conclusion:
The final amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**.<|im_end|>","After watering Celine's garden, 120 - 90 = <<120-90=30>>30 liters of water were left in the tank.
Celine was able to collect 30 x 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 liters of rainwater.
Thus, there are 30 + 60 = <<30+60=90>>90 liters of water in the tank.

To determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of petunias planted:**
   - Andy has 90 geraniums.
   - He has 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

2. **Calculate the number of petunias:**
   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40
   \]
   Substituting the given value for geraniums:
   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
   \]

3. **Add the number of geraniums and petunias together:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To find the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the amount spent in the second year**

- The first year's spending was $15,000.
- For the second year, they spend a third of this amount.

\[
\text{Second Year Spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Second Year Spending} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5,000 on advertising in the second year.

**Step 2: Add up the amounts from both years**

- First year spending: $15,000
- Second year spending: $5,000

\[
\text{Total Amount Spent} = \$15,000 + \$5,000

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of Carlos's and Benji's rentals, we need to calculate the cost for each individual rental separately and then sum these costs.

### Step 1: Calculate Carlos's Cost
- **Price per hour**: $30/hour
- **Number of hours used**: 3 hours

\[
\text{Carlos's Total Cost} = \text{Price per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

\[
\text{Carlos's Total Cost} = \$30 \times 3
\]

\[

### Step 2: Calculate Benji's Cost
- **Price per hour**: $18/hour
- **Number of hours used**: 5 hours

\[
\text{Benji's Total Cost} = \text{Price per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]

\[
\text{Benji's Total Cost} = \$18 \times 5
\]

\[
\text{Benji's Total Cost} = \$90

### Step 3: Sum the Costs
- **Carlos's Total Cost**: $90
- **Benji's Total Cost**: $90

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Carlos's Total Cost} + \text{Benji's Total Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$90 + \$90

To determine how many days Andrew will travel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days for the journey by car:**
   - The total time taken to travel by bus is 6 days.
   - The time taken to travel by car is half that of the bus trip.
   - Therefore, the time taken by car = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 6\) days.

\[
\text{Time taken by car} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ days}
\]

2. **Determine the total number of days spent traveling:**
   - Andrew travels by bus for 6 days.
   - He also returns by car for 3 days (since it takes half the time).

\[
\text{Total travel days} = 6 \text{ days (bus)} + 3 \text{ days (car)} = 9 \text{ days}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cards before any changes:**
   - Fire type: 30 cards
   - Grass type: 20 cards
   - Water type: 40 cards

   Total = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards

2. **Update the numbers after the changes:**
   - James loses 8 water type cards.
     New count of water type = 40 - 8 = 32 cards
   - James buys 14 grass type cards.
     New count of grass type = 20 + 14 = 34 cards

3. **Recalculate the total number of cards:**
   - Fire type remains unchanged at 30 cards
   - Grass type now at 34 cards
   - Water type at 32 cards

   New total = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

4. **Determine the probability of picking a water type card:**
   The probability \( P \) of picking a water type card from a random pick is given by the ratio of the number of water type cards to the new total number of cards.

\[ P(\text{water}) = \frac{\text{number of water type cards}}{\text{new total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96} \]

5. **Simplify the fraction and convert to percentage:**

   Simplify the fraction first:
   
   \[
   \frac{32}{96} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

   Convert this fraction to a percentage:

   \[
   \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100\% = 33.33\%

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Chad's burrito before applying any discounts or upgrades, then subtract the amount he used on the gift card. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the base price of the burrito
The base price of the burrito is $6.50.

### Step 2: Add the cost of the additional toppings
Chad adds extra meat for $2.00.
Chad also adds extra cheese for $1.00.
Chad adds avocado for $1.00.
Chad adds two sauces for $0.25 each (since there are two sauces).

Total cost for toppings = $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + ($0.25 × 2)
= $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50
= $4.50

### Step 3: Apply the upgrade fee
Chad upgrades his meal for an additional $3.00.

### Step 4: Total cost before discount
Total cost before upgrading = Base price + Toppings cost + Upgrade fee
= $6.50 + $4.50 + $3.00
= $14.00

### Step 5: Subtract the gift card from the total cost
Chad uses a gift card for $5.00.

Final total cost after using the gift card = $14.00 - $5.00
= $9.00

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is **$9.00**.<|im_end|>","He orders 2 sauces at $0.25 each so 2*.25 = $<<2*.25=0.50>>0.50 for sauce

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Kalinda's Speed**: Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
2. **Mom's Speed**: Her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

First, we need to determine how many pieces each person adds or places in one minute.

- Kalinda's rate: \( \frac{4}{\text{minute}} = 4 \) pieces/minute
- Mom's rate: Since she can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her rate is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces/minute

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for both of them to complete the puzzle together.

Since they work simultaneously, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates.

Combined rate: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) pieces/minute

Next, we know that there are 360 pieces in the puzzle. To find out how long it takes them to complete the puzzle together, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:

Time (in minutes) = Total number of pieces / Combined rate
\( Time = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} \)
\( Time = 60 \text{ minutes} \)

Finally, since we want the time in hours, we convert minutes to hours:

\( Time (\text{hours}) = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \)
\( Time (\text{hours}) = 1 \text{ hour} \)

Therefore, it will take them exactly 1 hour to complete the puzzle when working together at their respective speeds. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 1 hour.<|im_end|>","Her mom places 2 pieces per minute because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2

   - The total number of watermelons at the start was 120.
   - 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - Calculate 30% of 120.

\[
\text{Number of ready watermelons} = \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 36

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Mark pays in total for the cars, we need to consider both the purchase price of the cars and the taxes and registration fees. Let's break this down step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of purchasing the cars**

Mark buys 12 cars at $20,000 each.

\[ \text{Total Cost of Cars} = 12 \times \$20,000 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost of Cars} = \$240,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total tax paid on the cars**

Mark pays an additional 10% tax on the cars.

\[ \text{Tax Amount} = 10\% \times \$240,000 \]

\[ \text{Tax Amount} = 0.10 \times \$240,000 \]

\[ \text{Tax Amount} = \$24,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total registration fee**

Mark also pays a registration fee of $1,000 per car.

\[ \text{Registration Fee Total} = 12 \times \$1,000 \]

\[ \text{Registration Fee Total} = \$12,000 \]

**Step 4: Sum up all costs**

Now, let's add up all the expenses (purchase of cars + tax + registration):

\[ \text{Total Payment} = \text{Total Cost of Cars} + \text{Tax Amount} + \text{Registration Fee Total} \]

\[ \text{Total Payment} = \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 \]

To determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many shells Robert collected on Monday.
2. Use that information to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
3. Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday based on her collection from Monday.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many shells Robert collected on Monday.
Robert collects 20 shells on Monday.

### Step 2: Use that information to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday. So, if Robert collects 20 shells, then:
\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Monday} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times as many shells as she did on Monday. Since she collected 25 shells on Monday, on Tuesday she would have collected:
\[ \text{Shells collected by Kylie on Tuesday} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, the number of shells Kylie collects on Tuesday is **50**.

The final answer is:

2. **Penguins that jump into the ocean**:
   - One-third of the total penguins jump into the ocean.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \) penguins jump into the ocean.
3. **Penguins remaining after jumping into the ocean**:
   - Subtract the number that jumped from the total.
   - Calculation: \( 36 - 12 = 24 \) penguins remain.
4. **Penguins that go inside the cave**:
   - Another one-third of the remaining penguins go inside the cave.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8 \) penguins go inside the cave.
5. **Penguins remaining after going inside the cave**:
   - Subtract the number that went inside the cave from the remaining penguins.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Steve's daily tomato consumption:**
   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day.
   - Therefore, Steve eats \( 2G \) tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate Steve's weekly tomato consumption:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, Steve consumes \( 2G \times 7 = 14G \) tomatoes per week.

3. **Find out how many tomatoes one vine produces per week:**
   - A single vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Determine how many vines are needed if Steve wants to consume 14G tomatoes per week:**
   - To find the number of vines required, divide the total number of tomatoes Steve needs by the number produced by one vine.
   - Number of vines \( V = \frac{14G}{3} \).

5. **Simplify the expression for the number of vines:**
   - Simplifying, we get \( V = \frac{14G}{3} \approx 4.67 \).
   - Since the number of vines must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a vine), round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, Steve needs at least 5 vines to meet his tomato consumption requirements.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much ink is in one pen.
2. Calculate how much ink Ram has initially.
3. Determine how much ink Ram uses for every new pen made.
4. Calculate how many new pens Ram can make before his ink runs out.
5. Sum up all the pens Ram has.

Let's go through these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much ink is in one pen.
Assume that each pen contains 'x' units of ink.

### Step 2: Calculate how much ink Ram has initially.
Ram buys 25 pens, so he has 25 * x units of ink.

### Step 3: Determine how much ink Ram uses for every new pen made.
For every new pen made, Ram uses (1/5) * x units of ink because he mixes ink from five empty pens.

### Step 4: Calculate how many new pens Ram can make before his ink runs out.
Since he uses (1/5)x units of ink per new pen, the number of new pens he can make is:
\[ \text{Number of new pens} = \frac{\text{Total ink}}{(1/5)x} = \frac{25x}{(1/5)x} = 125 \]

### Step 5: Sum up all the pens Ram has.
Initially, Ram has 25 pens. After making 125 new pens using his initial ink supply, he will have:
\[ 25 + 125 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is **150**.<|im_end|>","He can make 5 pens when the 25 run low because 25 / 5 = <<25/5=5>>5

Johnny has $20 as his allowance plus an additional $10.

\[
\text{Total initial amount} = \$20 + \$10 = \$30

**Step 2: Determine how much money triples when invested**

Since the investment triples, we need to multiply the initial amount by 3.

\[
\text{Amount after tripling} = \$30 \times 3 = \$90

**Step 3: Verify that there was no change in the amount since it was already calculated correctly**

Therefore, the amount remains at $90 because the $10 extra from Step 1 does not affect the calculation of tripling.

So, after investing the money, Johnny has **$90**.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has based on the given information and then find out how many more candies John has compared to James.

1. **Determine the number of candies Robert has:**
   - We know that John has 54 candies.
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
   - Therefore, \( J = 2R \) where \( J \) represents John's candies.
   
   Given \( J = 54 \), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   54 = 2R
   \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{54}{2} = 27

2. **Calculate the number of candies James has:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of candies James has.
   - Therefore, \( M = R + 6 \).
   
   Since \( R = 27 \), we can calculate:
   \[
   M = 27 + 6 = 33

3. **Find the difference in the number of candies between John and James:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - The difference is calculated as follows:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of books each person has initially:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine what happens when they exchange books:**
   - When Dolly reads Pandora's book, she gains that book.
   - When Dolly reads her own book, she loses that book.
   - When Pandora reads Dolly's book, she gains that book.
   - When Pandora reads her own book, she loses that book.

3. **Calculate the net effect on the total number of books:**
   - Initially, there are 3 books (since Dolly has 2 and Pandora has 1).
   - Each time Dolly reads Pandora's book or Pandora reads Dolly's book, the total number of books increases by 1 because each book changes hands but no new books are added to the pool.
   - Similarly, each time Dolly reads her own book or Pandora reads her own book, the total number of books decreases by 1 because each book is lost but no new books are gained from the pool.

4. **Sum up all exchanges:**
   - Since they exchange books back and forth multiple times, we need to determine if these exchanges result in an even number of exchanges for each person.
   - Let's say they exchange books \(n\) times between themselves.
   - After \(n\) exchanges, each person will have exchanged books with the other, resulting in a net change in the number of books based on their initial count.

5. **Final calculation:**

                    question:
                    Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.  . He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a ? week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 ? minutes.  How many hours does ; he : spend writing a week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of letters sent per week:**
   - Mike stops being pen pals with 2 people.
   - Each of these 2 people sends 2 letters per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters sent per week is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

2. **Calculate the total number of letters received per week:**
   - Mike receives letters from the remaining 3 people (since he stopped with 2).
   - Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters per week.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters received per week is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Determine the total number of letters processed per week:**
   - The total number of letters processed per week is the sum of the letters sent and the letters received.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters processed per week is \(4 + 6 = 10\).

4. **Convert the time spent on writing from minutes to hours:**
   - Since Mike writes a page every 6 minutes, he spends \(6\) minutes writing for each letter.
   - If he processes 10 letters per week, then the total time spent writing per week is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) minutes.
   - To convert 60 minutes to hours, divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
   - Therefore, the total time spent writing per week is \(60 / 60 = 1\) hour.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]<|im_end|>","He is penpals with 5-2=<<5-2=3>>3 people

                    Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes ! per month. Every day he has a ; 15-minute call with his boss, and he's had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people. How many minutes does Jason have left if this month has 30 , days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total minutes used for calls**
- Each day Jason makes a 15-minute call with his boss.
- This month has 30 days.

\[
\text{Total minutes with boss} = \text{Minutes per call} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
= 15 \text{ minutes/call} \times 30 \text{ days}
\]

\[
= 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Add extra minutes Jason has**

Jason has 300 extra minutes from other people in addition to those made with his boss.

\[
\text{Extra minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Sum up all the minutes used**

Now we add the minutes used with the boss and the extra minutes together.

\[
\text{Total minutes used} = \text{Minutes with boss} + \text{Extra minutes}
\]

\[
= 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
= 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 4: Subtract the total minutes used from the monthly limit**

Jason's phone plan allows him 1000 minutes per month.

\[
\text{Remaining minutes} = \text{Monthly plan limit} - \text{Total minutes used}
\]

\[
= 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
= 250 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, after considering all these factors, Jason has **250 minutes left** for the month.<|im_end|>","First find the total time Jason spends calling his boss: 15 minutes/call * 30 calls/month = <<15*30=450>>450 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fries Kyle took.
2. Calculate how many fries Billy took.
3. Find out how many fries Ginger initially gave Griffin.
4. Calculate how many fries Colby took from Griffin.
5. Add up all the fries Griffin has at the end and set it equal to 27.

Let's go through each step carefully:

1. **Kyle took 5 fries.**
   \[
   \text{Fries left} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

2. **Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.**
   \[
   \text{Fries Billy took} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fries left after Billy} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

3. **Ginger gives Griffin some fries. Let \( x \) be the number of fries she gives him.**
   \[
   \text{Total fries before giving to Ginger} = 9
   \]

4. **Colby takes 3 fewer fries than Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took:**
   \[
   \text{Fries Colby took} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

5. **Summing up all the fries Griffin has at the end:**
   \[
   9 + (x - 2) = 27
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   9 + x - 2 = 27
   \]
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

   - Aquarium B has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of fish in both aquariums:**
   According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (which is 28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums combined. Let \( F \) be the amount of fish in each aquarium. Therefore,

                    question:
                    Jeans makeup artist charges her $250 an hour. !  She requires very expensive makeup for a movie she is in and it takes 6 hours to do each day and she needs ; it done 4 times a week.  The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup services after the discount, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discounts**

- **Hourly rate**: $250 per hour.
- **Number of days worked**: 4 days per week.
- **Number of movies**: 5 weeks.

First, calculate the number of hours spent on all the makeup sessions:
\[ \text{Total Hours} = \text{Hours per Day} \times \text{Number of Days per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks} \]
\[ \text{Total Hours} = 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} \]

Calculate \( \text{Total Hours} \):
\[ \text{Total Hours} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, multiply the total hours by the hourly rate to find the total cost before any discount:
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = \text{Total Hours} \times \text{Hourly Rate} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 120 \text{ hours} \times \$250/\text{hour} \]

Calculate \( \text{Total Cost Before Discount} \):
\[ \text{Total Cost Before Discount} = 120 \times 250 = \$30,000 \]

**Step 2: Apply the discount**

- **Discount percentage**: 10%.

Calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Total Cost Before Discount} \times \frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100} \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$30,000 \times \frac{10}{100} \]

Calculate \( \text{Discount Amount} \):
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$30,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,000 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost before discount to get the final amount Jean pays:
\[ \text{Final Total Cost} = \text{Total Cost Before Discount} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Final Total Cost} = \$30,000 - \$3,000 \]

Calculate \( \text{Final Total Cost} \):
\[ \text{Final Total Cost} = \$27,000 \]

Therefore, Jean paid a total of $\boxed{27000}$ dollars for the makeup services.<|im_end|>","Jean pays 250*6=$<<250*6=1500>>1500 a day

   Isabelle is splitting the cost with her two parents, so there are three people in total (Isabelle + 2 parents).

3. **Divide the total cost by the number of people:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of People}}

To determine who consumed more calories and by how much, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies eaten by Sue's sister on Monday**
- Sister eats 5 cookies on Monday.

**Step 2: Determine how many cookies Sue ate on Monday**
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- Therefore, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies on Monday.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both on Monday**
- Total cookies for both: \(5 + 20 = 25\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by Sue on Tuesday**
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
- Sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday, so Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies on Tuesday.

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both on Tuesday**
- Total cookies for both: \(13 + 26 = 39\)

**Step 6: Sum up the total cookies eaten over the two days**
- Total cookies for both over the two days: \(25 + 39 = 64\)

**Step 7: Convert the total cookies into calories**
- Since 1 cookie equals 200 calories,
- Total calories for both: \(64 \times 200 = 12800\)

**Step 8: Calculate the difference in calorie consumption between Sue and her sister**
- Difference in calories: \(12800 - (5 \times 200) = 12800 - 1000 = 11800\)

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students in the school.
- We know that each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes.

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of boys and girls in the school.
- The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of girls in the first two classes.
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

\[
\text{Total number of girls from the first two classes} = 15 + 12 = 27
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of girls in the third class.
- Since there are 30 girls in total and we already accounted for 27 girls from the first two classes,

\[
\text{Girls in the third class} = 30 - 27 = 3
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of boys in the third class.
- Each class has 20 students and we know there are 30 students in total.
- Therefore, the number of boys in the third class must be calculated based on the remaining students after accounting for the girls.

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - (\text{Girls in the first class} + \text{Girls in the second class})
\]

Since we have determined that the first two classes account for 27 girls, we can calculate the remaining number of students (boys) for the third class.

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - (15 + 12)
\]

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - 27
\]

This calculation shows an error since we cannot subtract more than the total number of students. Let's correct our approach:

### Correct Approach:
Given that each class has 20 students and the school is divided equally between boys and girls,
- The third class should also follow the same distribution pattern.

Therefore, if the first two classes together account for 27 girls, the third class would logically also have half of these girls to maintain the equal ratio.

So, the correct calculation should be:

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - (\text{Girls in the first class} + \text{Girls in the second class}) 
= 20 - (15 + 12) 
= 20 - 27
\]

Since the above logic doesn't work correctly, let's re-evaluate the distribution without assuming incorrect numbers:

### Final Calculation:
- Given the total number of students is 60, with 30 boys and 30 girls, and knowing that the first two classes have 15 and 12 girls respectively, we need to find the number of boys in the third class.

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - (15 + 12)
\]

Let's simplify further:

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - 27
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Boys in the third class} = 20 - 27
\]

                    question:
                    Last night Rick killed ten wolves and 15 cougars while hunting. Today Rick killed three times as many . wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night. How many animals ! did Rick kill?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many wolves Rick killed today.
- Rick killed ten wolves last night.
- Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cougars Rick killed today.

From the information given:
\[ W = 3C \]

Since we know from yesterday that Rick killed ten wolves:
\[ W = 10 \]

Therefore:
\[ 3C = 10 \]
Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

This indicates that Rick killed approximately 3.33 cougars today. However, since the number of animals must be an integer (assuming he can only kill whole animals), we need to reconsider our approach or assumptions.

### Step 2: Correct our initial assumption about the number of cougars killed today.
Given the context of the problem, it seems more reasonable to assume Rick could have killed exactly 3.33 cougars because he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which suggests he might have been aiming at that exact number.

Let's re-evaluate:
If Rick kills three times as many wolves as cougars today:
\[ W = 3C \]
And knowing he killed ten wolves last night:
\[ W = 10 \]

Thus:
\[ 3C = 10 \]
So:
\[ C = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]

However, if he killed exactly 3.33 cougars today, then the next day when he killed three fewer cougars than yesterday, he would have killed:
\[ C_{\text{today}} = 3.33 - 3 = 0.33 \]

But again, considering practical constraints in nature, it’s unlikely he would have killed such a fractional number of animals.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals Rick killed over two nights.
- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, he killed 3 wolves and approximately 3.33 cougars.

First night:
\[ Total_{last\_night} = Wolves + Cougars = 10 + 15 = 25 \]

Second night:
\[ Wolves = 3 \times 3.33 \approx 9.99 \]
\[ Cougars = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Total second night:
\[ Total_{second\_night} = Wolves + Cougars = 9.99 + 12 = 21.99 \]

### Final Calculation:
Adding both totals together:
\[ Total_{total} = Total_{last\_night} + Total_{second\_night} = 25 + 21.99 = 46.99 \]

Given the rounding errors, Rick likely rounded his numbers and killed slightly different amounts on each night but overall, he killed approximately 47 animals.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 47 animals.<|im_end|>","The total number of animals that Rick killed while hunting yesterday is 15+10 = <<15+10=25>>25
Today, Rick killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, a total of 15-3 = <<15-3=12>>12 cougars.
He also killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, a total of 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 wolves.
Together, his hunt today yielded 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 animals.
In total, he has 48+25 = <<48+25=73>>73 animals from the hunt.

To determine Bill's current floor after riding the elevator, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial floor**: Bill starts on the 3rd floor.
2. **Determine the multiplier for the number of floors**: The problem states that he goes up ""to the floor that's equal to 4 times his starting floor plus 6.""
3. **Calculate the total number of floors he moves upwards**:
   - Starting floor: 3
   - Multiplier: 4
   - Total increase in floors = \( 4 \times 3 + 6 \)

   Let's calculate this multiplication first:
   \[
   4 \times 3 = 12
   \]
   Then add 6:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18

   So, Bill travels an additional 18 floors.

4. **Add the additional floors traveled to the starting floor**:
   \[
   3 (starting) + 18 (additional) = 21

   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

2. **Calculate 30% of Mitchel's total slides (30):**
   \[

3. **Subtract this value from Mitchel's total to find out how many times Anne went down:**
   \[
   30 - 9 = 21

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Number of Cows:**
   - There are ten stalls.
   - Each stall has 20 cows initially.

2. **Mr. Sylas Buys More Cows:**
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows.

3. **Total Number of Cows After Purchase:**
   - Initial total: \(10 \times 20 = 200\) cows.
   - Bought additional: \(40\) cows.
   - Total after purchase: \(200 + 40 = 240\) cows.

4. **Dividing the New Cows Equally Among Stalls:**
   - The 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls.
   - Number of new cows per stall: \(40 \div 20 = 2\).

5. **Total Number of Cows After Redistribution:**
   - Original 200 cows remain unchanged.
   - Additional 40 cows distributed equally to all 20 stalls.
   - New total (after redistribution): \(200 + 40 = 240\) cows.

6. **Cows in 8 Stalls:**
   - We need to find out how many cows are in 8 specific stalls.
   - Since each stall now holds 2 cows from the redistributed group, we calculate for 8 stalls as follows:
     \[8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows}\]

Therefore, there are 16 cows in 8 of the stalls.<|im_end|>","When Mr. Sylas puts an equal number of the cows he bought into the stalls, each stall gets 40/10 = <<40/10=4>>4 new cows.

Since each stall had 20 cows before Mr. Sylas added four into each of the stalls, the total number of cows in eight of the stalls was 8*20= <<8*20=160>>160 cows.
There are 160+32 = <<160+32=192>>192 cows in eight stalls after Mr. Sylas adds four into each of the stalls.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill separately, then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the value of the pennies
- Brady has 100 pennies.
- Each penny is worth $0.01.
  
\[ \text{Total value from pennies} = 100 \times 0.01 \]

\[
= 1.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the nickels
- Brady has 40 nickels.
- Each nickel is worth $0.05.

\[ \text{Total value from nickels} = 40 \times 0.05 \]

\[
= 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the value of the dimes
- Brady has 20 dimes.
- Each dime is worth $0.10.

\[ \text{Total value from dimes} = 20 \times 0.10 \]

\[
= 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the value of the dollar bills
- Brady has 40 dollar bills.
- Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.

\[ \text{Total value from dollar bills} = 40 \times 1.00 \]

\[
= 40.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Sum up all the values
Now, add up the total values calculated in steps 1 through 4:

\[ \text{Total value} = (1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00) \]

\[
= 45.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.<|im_end|>","Since a penny is 1 cent, then 100 pennies is equal to 100 x 1 cent = <<100=100>>100 cents.
Since nickel is 5 cents, then 40 nickels is equal to 40 x 5 = <<40*5=200>>200 cents.
Since a dime is equal to 10 cents, then 20 dimes are equal to 20 x 10 = <<20*10=200>>200 cents.
So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.
Thus, Brady has a total of $40 + $5 = $<<40+5=45>>45 in his piggy bank.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the entire redwood tree:**
   - We know that one 10-foot section of the redwood weighs 400 pounds.
   - The redwood is 200 feet tall, so there are \( \frac{200}{10} = 20 \) such sections.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the redwood is \( 20 \times 400 \) pounds.

2. **Determine the amount of wood eaten by termites:**
   - Termites ate 30% of the wood.
   - So, the remaining wood after the termites have eaten is 70%.

3. **Calculate the weight of the remaining wood:**
   - The weight of the remaining wood can be found by multiplying the total weight of the redwood by 70%.

Let's do the calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the redwood tree
\[ \text{Total weight} = 20 \times 400 \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 2: Determine the weight of the remaining wood after termites eat some of it
Since termites ate 30%, they left 70% of the original wood intact.

   - Nancy owes $0.50 per book.
   - She has 8 books.

\[ \text{Cost per book} = \$0.50 \]

\[ \text{Total cost from books} = 8 \times \$0.50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost from books} = \$4.00 \]

2. **Add the flat fee**:
   - There is an additional flat fee of $2.00.

3. **Sum up all costs**:
   - Total cost (books) + Flat fee = Total amount owed.

\[ \text{Total amount owed} = \$4.00 + \$2.00 \]
\[ \text{Total amount owed} = \$6.00 \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples Andrea has:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples.

2. **Calculate the number of apples Jamal has based on Andrea's information:**
   - Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Apples} = \text{Jamal's Apples} + 8
     \]
   - Let \( A_J \) represent the number of apples Jamal has.
   - From the equation above:
     \[
     52 = A_J + 8
     \]
   - Solving for \( A_J \):
     \[
     A_J = 52 - 8 = 44
     \]

3. **Find out how many bananas Jamal has:**
   - According to the problem, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
   - We already know Jamal has 44 apples, so:
     \[
     \text{Bananas} = \text{Apples} + 4
     \]
   - Substituting the value of apples:
     \[
     \text{Bananas} = 44 + 4 = 48

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits both have together:**
   - Andrea has 52 apples and 48 bananas.
   - Jamal also has 44 apples (as calculated earlier).

   Adding them up:
   \[
   \text{Total Fruits} = \text{Andrea's Apples} + \text{Andrea's Bananas} + \text{Jamal's Apples} + \text{Jamal's Bananas}

   - Substituting in numbers:
     \[
     \text{Total Fruits} = 52 + 0 + 44 + 48 = 146

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much flour is needed for one cookie**

First, let's find out how much flour is needed for one cookie. We know that two cups of flour are needed for a dozen (12) cookies.

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we can divide the total amount of flour by the number of cookies in a dozen to find out how much flour is needed per cookie.

\[ \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{\text{Total flour}}{\text{Number of cookies in a dozen}} \]

Given that 2 cups of flour are needed for 12 cookies,

\[ \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{2}{12} \]

Simplify this fraction:

\[ \text{Flour per cookie} = \frac{1}{6} \]

So, one cookie requires \( \frac{1}{6} \) cup of flour.

**Step 2: Calculate the total flour needed for 36 cookies today**

Now, if we want to make 36 cookies, we simply multiply the flour needed for one cookie by the number of cookies.

\[ \text{Total flour for 36 cookies today} = \text{Flour per cookie} \times 36 \]

Substitute the value we found earlier:

\[ \text{Total flour for 36 cookies today} = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 36 \]

Calculate this product:

\[ \text{Total flour for 36 cookies today} = 6 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow**

Similarly, if we want to make 30 cookies tomorrow, we use the same calculation as before but with the new number of cookies.

\[ \text{Total flour for 30 cookies tomorrow} = \text{Flour per cookie} \times 30 \]

Substitute the value we found earlier:

\[ \text{Total flour for 30 cookies tomorrow} = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \times 30 \]

Calculate this product:

\[ \text{Total flour for 30 cookies tomorrow} = 5 \]

**Conclusion**
Carla needs **6 cups of flour** today and **5 cups of flour** tomorrow to bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow respectively. Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is}
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ cups today}, 5 \text{ cups tomorrow}}
\]<|im_end|>","Carla will bake a total of 36 + 30 = <<36+30=66>>66 cookies.
Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, then 66 cookies are equal to 66/12 = <<66/12=5.5>>5.5 dozens.
Hence, Carla will need 5.5 x 2 = <<5.5*2=11>>11 cups of flour.

1. Determine how many trees Ferdinand has.
2. Calculate how many trees Harry has based on Ferdinand's count.
3. Find out how many more trees Harry has compared to Ferdinand.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the number of trees Ferdinand has.
Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{\text{Number of trees Chris has}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3

#### Step 2: Calculate the number of trees Harry has.
Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = (\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has}) + 5
\]
\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = (3) + 5 = 8
\]

#### Step 3: Find out how many more trees Harry has compared to Ferdinand.
Now, we compare the number of trees in Harry’s yard to those in Ferdinand’s yard.
\[
\text{Difference in number of trees} = \text{Number of trees in Harry's yard} - \text{Number of trees in Ferdinand's yard}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in number of trees} = 8 - 3 = 5

<|im_start|>user
To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Brokerage Fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
- Selling Price = $350,000
- Brokerage Fee = 5% of $350,000
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 \]
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 17,500 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Transfer Fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.
- Selling Price = $350,000
- Transfer Fee = 12% of $350,000
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 \]
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 42,000 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost Including Fees
Total Cost = Selling Price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 409,500 \]

### Step 4: Determine How Much More the Total Cost Exceeds Mrs. Cruz's Budget
Mrs. Cruz's budget = $400,000
Difference = Total Cost - Mrs. Cruz's Budget
\[ \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 9,500 \]

### Final Answer:
The total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by **$9,500**.<|im_end|>","The brokerage fee is $350 000 x 5/100 = $<<350000*5/100=17500>>17500.

The total price of the house is $350 000 + $17500 + $42000 = $409 500.
So, it is $409 500 - $400 000 = $<<409500-400000=9500>>9500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total expenses (transfer fees and brokerage fees) and then subtract them from the selling price.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Transfer Fees:**
   - The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   - Selling Price = $400,000
   - Transfer Fee Amount = \( \frac{3}{100} \times 400,000 \)
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Transfer Fee Amount} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
     \]

2. **Calculate the Brokerage Fees:**
   - The brokerage fees are 5% of the selling price.
   - Selling Price = $400,000
   - Brokerage Fee Amount = \( \frac{5}{100} \times 400,000 \)
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Brokerage Fee Amount} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
     \]

3. **Total Expenses:**
   - Total Expenses = Transfer Fees + Brokerage Fees
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total Expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
     \]

4. **Remaining Loan Amount:**
   - Mr. Tan paid an additional $250,000 towards the loan.
   - Therefore, the net proceeds after paying off the loan will be:
     \[
     \text{Net Proceeds} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Expenses}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Net Proceeds} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } \$368,000}
\]<|im_end|>","Mr. Tan paid $400 000 x 3/100 = $12 000 for the transfer fees.

So, Mr. Tan paid a total of $12 000 + $20 000 + $250 000 = $282 000 for the transfer, brokerage, and loan fees.
Hence, Mr. Tan's net proceeds is $400 000 - $282 000 = $118 000.

To solve this problem, we need to break down the heating process into its individual steps and calculate the total time taken.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

2. **Heating the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees (with an additional 40%):**
   - The original time is 20 minutes.
   - An increase of 40% means adding 40% of 20 minutes to itself.
   - Calculation: \( 20 \times 0.4 = 8 \) minutes more.
   - Total time for heating from 300 to 400 degrees: \( 20 + 8 = 28 \) minutes.

3. **Cooking the chicken after heating to 400 degrees:**
   - We know that cooking takes 5 minutes less than the total time for heating to 400 degrees.
   - Total time for heating to 400 degrees is 28 minutes.
   - Time for cooking: \( 28 - 5 = 23 \) minutes.

4. **Adding the time spent on heating to the time spent on cooking:**
   - Heating time: 20 minutes.
   - Cooking time: 23 minutes.
   - Total time from start to end: \( 20 + 23 = 43 \) minutes.

Therefore, the total amount of time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is \(\boxed{43}\) minutes.<|im_end|>","It takes 20*.4=8 more minutes to go from 300 to 400 degrees than from room temperature to 300

\[ \text{Number of candies in the third bag} = \frac{300}{2} \]

### Step 4: Sum the number of M&M candies from all three bags.
Let's calculate these values:

1. **First Bag**:
\[ 300 \text{ candies} \]

2. **Second Bag**:
\[ 300 + 12 = 312 \text{ candies} \]

3. **Third Bag**:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ candies} \]

Now, let's add them together:
\[ 300 + 312 + 150 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 300 + 312 = 612 \]
\[ 612 + 150 = 762 \]

Therefore, the total number of M&M candies Mary got is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in both houses and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the number of windows in one house:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   
   So, the number of windows per house = \(3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}\).

2. **Add the additional windows in each house:**
   - There are 4 extra windows in each house.

   Therefore, the total number of windows in one house = \(6 \text{ regular windows} + 4 \text{ extra windows} = 10 \text{ windows}\).

3. **Calculate the total number of windows for both houses:**
   Since John has two houses, we multiply the number of windows in one house by 2.

   Total number of windows = \(10 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}\).

So, the total number of windows between the two houses is \(\boxed{20}\).<|im_end|>","Each house has 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 windows for the bedrooms

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much change the cashier gives back to the mother, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of her purchases**

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Package of pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35

First, add the costs of the cocoa and laundry:

$4.20 + $9.45 = $13.65

Next, add the cost of the pasta:

$13.65 + $1.35 = $15.00

So, the total cost of her purchases is $15.00.

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount she paid**

Amount paid: $20.00

Change given back = Amount paid - Total cost

Change given back = $20.00 - $15.00

Subtracting this:

$20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

                    question:
                    Terri is knitting a sweater with two sleeves, a collar, and a decorative rosette. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete, the collar takes a tenth of that number of ? stitches, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar. The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project. How many stitches does each ; sleeve take?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stitches each sleeve will take based on the total number of stitches required for the entire sweater.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of stitches in the collar:**
   - The body of the sweater requires 900 stitches.
   - The collar requires a tenth of the body's stitches.
   
   \[
   \text{Stitches in the collar} = \frac{\text{Stitches in the body}}{10}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Stitches in the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stitches remaining after accounting for the body and collar:**
   - Total stitches for the body and collar combined:
   
   \[
   \text{Total stitches (body + collar)} = 900 + 90 = 990 \text{ stitches}
   \]

3. **Find out how many stitches are left for the rosette:**
   - The total project consists of 1800 stitches.
   - Subtract the stitches already accounted for (body + collar):
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining stitches for the rosette} = 1800 - 990 = 810 \text{ stitches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of stitches per sleeve:**
   - Each sleeve contributes equally to the body and the rosette.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of stitches per sleeve.
   
   Since there are two sleeves, the total number of stitches per sleeve would be \( 2x \).

5. **Set up the equation for the total number of stitches per sleeve:**
   - The total number of stitches for both sleeves should equal the remaining stitches available for them.
   
   \[
   2x = 810
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \).
   
   \[
   x = \frac{810}{2} = 405
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Each sleeve has 405 stitches.
   - Two sleeves together have \( 405 \times 2 = 810 \) stitches.
   - This leaves no stitches for the body or the rosette, which matches our earlier calculations.

### Conclusion:
Each sleeve takes 405 stitches.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 405.<|im_end|>","The collar takes 900 / 10 = <<900/10=90>>90 stitches.
The rosette takes 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 stitches.
The body, collar, and rosette together take 900 + 90 + 180 = <<900+90+180=1170>>1170 stitches.
Thus, the sleeves take 1800 - 1170 = <<1800-1170=630>>630 stitches.
Thus, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = <<630/2=315>>315 stitches.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying both tomato seeds and celery seeds.

1. **Calculate the cost of tomato seeds:**
   - Number of packets of tomato seeds = 20
   - Cost per packet of tomato seeds = $40
   - Total cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
   \[
   \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = \$800
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of celery seeds:**
   - Number of packets of celery seeds = 80
   - Cost per packet of celery seeds = $30
   - Total cost of celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
   \[
   \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = \$2400
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all seeds:**
   - Total cost of tomato seeds + Total cost of celery seeds
   \[

                    Sean is practicing for his role in a theater production. He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third . of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of lines Sean needs to memorize for both scenes.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of lines in the first scene.
- The first scene has twice as many lines as the solo song.
- The solo song has 54 lines.
- Therefore, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.

- Only a third of the lines in the first scene are his.
- So, the number of lines he has to memorize from the first scene is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 108\).

Let's compute that:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
\]

So, Sean has to memorize 36 lines from the first scene.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of lines in the second scene.
- The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
- The solo song has 54 lines.
- Therefore, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.

- Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are his.
- So, the number of lines he has to memorize from the second scene is \(\frac{4}{5} \times 60\).

Let's compute that:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
\]

So, Sean has to memorize 48 lines from the second scene.

### Step 3: Sum up all the lines Sean has to memorize.
- From the first scene: 36 lines
- From the second scene: 48 lines
- Adding these together gives us the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:

\[
36 + 48 = 84
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{84}

To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the time required to dig one small hole**

- Time taken to dig one small hole = 3 minutes

**Step 2: Calculate the total time required to dig 30 small holes**

- Total time for 30 small holes = Number of small holes × Time per small hole
- Total time for 30 small holes = 30 × 3 minutes
- Total time for 30 small holes = 90 minutes

**Step 3: Calculate the time required to dig one large hole**

- Time taken to dig one large hole = 10 minutes

**Step 4: Calculate the total time required to dig 15 large holes**

- Total time for 15 large holes = Number of large holes × Time per large hole
- Total time for 15 large holes = 15 × 10 minutes
- Total time for 15 large holes = 150 minutes

**Step 5: Add up the total time for all small and large holes**

- Total time (in minutes) = Time for small holes + Time for large holes
- Total time (in minutes) = 90 minutes + 150 minutes
- Total time (in minutes) = 240 minutes

**Step 6: Convert the total time from minutes to hours**

- Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
- Total time in hours = Total time in minutes ÷ 60
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes ÷ 60
- Total time in hours = 4 hours

Therefore, it will take Matthew **4 hours** to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The final answer is {The final answer is} 4 hours.<|im_end|>","It takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and he needs to dig 30 small holes so it will take 3*30 = <<3*30=90>>90 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the current age difference between Mico and Marco.
- Let Mico's current age be \( A \).
- Let Marco's current age be \( B \).

We know that the sum of their ages is 20:
\[ A + B = 20 \]

Step 2: Find out how many years have passed since they met.
- The time has passed for both of them is 10 years.

Step 3: Calculate their future ages after these 10 years.
- Mico's future age will be \( A + 10 \).
- Marco's future age will be \( B + 10 \).

Step 4: Add their future ages together to find the total sum of their ages in 10 years.
\[
(A + 10) + (B + 10)
\]
Simplify this expression:
\[
A + 10 + B + 10 = A + B + 20
\]

Step 5: Substitute the known value from Step 1 (\( A + B = 20 \)) into the equation.
\[
20 + 20 = 40

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve those equations.

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( R \) represent Ruby's current age.
   Let \( S \) represent Sam's current age.

2. **Set up the first equation based on their ages:**
   According to the problem, Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
   \[
   R = 6S
   \]

3. **Set up the second equation based on their ages in 9 years:**
   In 9 years, Ruby will be \( R + 9 \) years old, and Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old. The problem states that at that time, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
   \[
   R + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]

4. **Substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
   From \( R = 6S \), substitute \( 6S \) for \( R \):
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   Distribute the 3 on the right side:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27

   Subtract 9 from both sides:

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.<|im_end|>","Let x be Sam's age and Y be Ruby's age. Ruby's age is currently 6 times Sam's age, so 6 * x = Y years.
In 9 years Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so, 3 * (x + 9) = (Y + 9) years.
To find out Sam's age, we substituted the first step in the second to get 3 * (x + 9) = (6 * x) + 9.
We distribute on one side of the equation to get (3 * x) + 27 = (6 * x) + 9.
We isolate Sam's age on one side of the equation to get 27 - 9 = (6 * x) - (3 * x).
We simplify the equation to get 18 = 3 * x.
Now we know that Sam's age is 18 / 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 years.

                    question:
                    Peter purchased ! 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. He also purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. ? How much did he pay in total in dollars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars separately, then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the cost of the popsicles:**
   - Peter bought 20 popsicles.
   - Each popsicle costs $0.25.
   - Total cost for popsicles = Number of popsicles × Cost per popsicle
   \[
   \text{Total cost for popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the ice cream bars:**
   - Peter bought 4 ice cream bars.
   - Each ice cream bar costs $0.50.
   - Total cost for ice cream bars = Number of ice cream bars × Cost per ice cream bar
   \[
   \text{Total cost for ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Sum the costs:**
   - Total amount paid = Total cost for popsicles + Total cost for ice cream bars
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7 \text{ dollars}}
\]<|im_end|>","The popsicles cost 0.25*20=<<0.25*20=5>>5 dollars.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of spots on one mamba:**
   - We know that a cobra has 70 spots.
   - There are twice as many spots on a mamba as on a cobra.
   - Let \( S \) represent the total number of spots on one mamba.

   Since a cobra has 70 spots:
   \[
   S = 2 \times 70
   \]

   Calculate \( S \):
   \[
   S = 140
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras:**
   - There are 40 cobras.
   - Each cobra has 70 spots.

   Total spots for cobras:
   \[
   40 \times 70
   \]

   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas:**
   - There are 60 mambas.
   - Each mamba has 140 spots.

   Total spots for mambas:
   \[
   60 \times 140
   \]

   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   60 \times 140 = 8400
   \]

4. **Add the total spots from both cobras and mambas:**
   \[
   2800 + 8400
   \]

   Perform the addition:
   \[
   2800 + 8400 = 11200
   \]

5. **Find half the total number of spots:**
   \[
   \frac{11200}{2}
   \]

   Perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{11200}{2} = 5600
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]<|im_end|>","A cobra, which has 70 spots, has twice as many spots as a mamba, meaning a mamba has 70/2= <<70/2=35>>35 spots.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people at the game**

- Number of team members = 12
- Number of coaches = 3
- Each team member brings 2 guests

First, calculate the total number of guests brought by the team members:
\[ \text{Total guests} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

Next, add the number of coaches to the total number of guests:
\[ \text{Total number of people} = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of pizzas needed**

Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are required, divide the total number of people by the serving capacity per pizza:
\[ \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{39}{3} = 13 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, multiply the number of pizzas by the price per pizza:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 13 \times 15 = \$195 \]

Therefore, Maddy will spend **$195** on pizzas.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\$195}
\]<|im_end|>","Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of topaz gemstones in each necklace:**
   - Each necklace consists of 8 topaz gemstones.

2. **Calculate the total length used by the topaz gemstones:**
   - Since each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - The total length for 8 topaz gemstones = \( 8 \times 1 \) inch = 8 inches.

3. **Determine the remaining length available for sterling silver beads:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length.
     \[
     25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads needed:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long (since it's one-quarter of an inch).
   - Divide the remaining length by the length of one bead.
     \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of stories written in the first week:**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

   Total for the first week = \( 20 + 40 + 60 \) = 120 stories.

2. **Determine how many stories each person writes in the second week:**
   - Since each person doubles their output from the first week, we multiply each number by 2.
   
   For Alani: 
   \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \)
   
   For Braylen: 
   \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)
   
   For Margot: 
   \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of stories written in the second week:**
   - Add up the double numbers from the second week.
   
   Second week total = \( 40 + 80 + 120 \) = 240 stories.

4. **Sum up the totals from both weeks:**
   - Add the first-week total to the second-week total.
   
   Total number of stories = \( 120 (first week) + 240 (second week) \) = 360 stories.

5. **Verify the calculation:**

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Ann's brother's current age:**
   - We know that Ann is 9 years old.
   - Her brother is twice as old as Ann.
   
   So, if Ann's brother is twice her age, we calculate his age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ann's brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

2. **Calculate the age difference between Ann and her brother:**
   - Ann is currently 9 years old.
   - Her brother is currently 18 years old.

   The age difference is:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \text{Brother's age} - \text{Ann's age} = 18 - 9 = 9
   \]

3. **Add the age difference to Ann's brother's future age:**
   - In 3 years, Ann's brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old.
   - Adding this to the age difference (9 years), we get:
   \[
   \text{Future age of Ann's brother} = (\text{Brother's future age}) + (\text{Age difference})

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Future age of Ann's brother} = 21 + 9 = 30

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of stars in one row:**
   - There are three rows of 8 stars.
   - Therefore, the total number of stars in these rows is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

2. **Calculate the number of stars in the other rows (both rows of 6 stars):**
   - There are two rows of 6 stars.
   - So, the total number of stars in these rows is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).

3. **Add up all the stars together to find out how many stars are already accounted for:**
   - The total number of stars from the three rows of 8 stars is 24.
   - Adding the stars from the two rows of 6 stars gives us \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.

4. **Subtract the number of stars that have been counted from the total number of stars on the flag:**
   - We know the flag has 76 stars in total.
   - Subtracting the 36 stars that we've already counted leaves us with \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars remaining.

5. **Divide the remaining stars equally among the 5-star rows:**
   - Since there are no more than four rows left, divide the remaining 40 stars by 5.
   - This gives us \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows.

To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones:**
   - Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight for 80 flagstones = \( 80 \times 75 \) pounds.

\[
80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds}

2. **Determine how many trucks are required to transport this total weight:**
   - The maximum weight that any truck can carry is 2000 pounds.
   - We divide the total weight (6000 pounds) by the capacity of one truck (2000 pounds).

\[
\frac{6000}{2000} = 3
\]

Therefore, **3 trucks** would be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

3. **Verify if more than one truck is necessary:**
   - Since 3 trucks are calculated as exactly what's needed based on the given capacities, no additional trucks are required beyond this number.

   - We know the formula for time is given by \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: 
     \[
     \text{time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken by the slow lane car to travel the same distance (480 miles):**
   - Using the same time formula, but now for the slow lane car:
     \[
     \text{time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}}
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives us:
     \[
     \text{time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is \(16\) hours. 

{The final answer is} 16 hours.<|im_end|>","At half the speed, the car in the slow lane travels at a speed of 1/2*60 = <<1/2*60=30>>30 miles per hour.
To travel 480 miles, the car in the slow lane traveling at 30 miles per hour will take 480/30 = <<480/30=16>>16 hours

                    question:
                    Ali is a superstar counter. He has won 22 medals for counting super fast. His friend Izzy is also a really good counter and has 5 less medals , than Ali. Together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. How many medals have been given out for counting?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many medals were given out in total based on the information provided about Ali's and Izzy's medal counts.

### Step 1: Determine Izzy's Medal Count
Ali has won 22 medals.
Izzy has 5 fewer medals than Ali.

\[
\text{Izzy's Medals} = \text{Ali's Medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17
\]

So, Izzy has 17 medals.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Medals Won by Both Ali and Izzy
We add their individual medal counts together:

\[
\text{Total Medals} = \text{Ali's Medals} + \text{Izzy's Medals} = 22 + 17 = 39
\]

So, Ali and Izzy together have won 39 medals.

### Step 3: Find the Number of Medals Given Out
According to the problem, the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number that Ali and Izzy have won together.

\[
\text{Medals Given Out} = 10 \times \text{Total Medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390
\]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is **390**.<|im_end|>","Izzy has 22-5=<<22-5=17>>17 medal
Medals of Ali and Izzy 22+17=<<22+17=39>>39 medals

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate total chocolate bars:**
   - There are 8 packets of chocolate bars.
   - Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
   - Total number of chocolate bars = \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \).

2. **Determine chocolate bars per adult:**
   - Each of the 4 adults receives 6 chocolate bars.
   - Total chocolate bars for adults = \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \).

3. **Subtract the chocolate bars given to adults from the total chocolate bars:**
   - Remaining chocolate bars after giving to adults = \( 40 - 24 = 16 \).

4. **Divide remaining chocolate bars among children:**
   - Number of children = 8.
   - Chocolate bars per child = \( \frac{16}{8} = 2 \).

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.

**Final Answer:** Each child will get 2 chocolate bars.<|im_end|>","Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars so 8 packets contain a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 bars
Each adult gets 6 bars so 4 adults will get 6*4 = <<6*4=24>>24 bars in total
There are now 40-24 = <<40-24=16>>16 bars left
16 bars are shared equally among 8 children, so each child will get 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 bars

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time Susan spends working**

- Susan starts at 8 a.m.
- She works until 11 a.m.

Total working hours = (11 - 8) hours = 3 hours

Since there are 60 minutes in one hour, we convert this to minutes:

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Susan takes a 30-minute break halfway through her workday. So, we need to subtract that from her total working time:

180 minutes (total working time) - 30 minutes (break) = 150 minutes

So, Susan actually worked for 150 minutes.

**Step 2: Convert her working time back to hours**

We know that there are 60 minutes in one hour, so:

150 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2.5 hours

Therefore, Susan spent 2.5 hours working on the online task.

**Step 3: Determine how many tasks she completed during her working hours**

Given that she completes one task every 10 minutes, we can calculate the number of tasks as follows:

Number of tasks = Total working time / Time per task
Number of tasks = 2.5 hours × (60 minutes/hour)
Number of tasks = 2.5 hours × 60 minutes/hour
Number of tasks = 150 minutes ÷ 10 minutes/task
Number of tasks = 15

She completed 15 tasks during her working period.

**Step 4: Calculate her earnings**

Susan earns $5 for each task, so her total earnings would be:

Total earnings = Number of tasks × Earnings per task
Total earnings = 15 tasks × $5/task
Total earnings = $75

Therefore, Susan earned $75 for completing the online task(s).

**Final Answer**
The final answer is: The final answer is The amount of money Susan earns for the online task is **$75**.<|im_end|>","Because she rests for half an hour, the time she works is 11 - 8 - 0.5 = <<11-8-0.5=2.5>>2.5 hours.

She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Points for Each Player at the Start

- **Mike**: 
  - Points from Round 1: 21
  - Points from Round 2: 21 (since he has more than 20)
  - Points from Round 3: 21 + 21 = 42 (because he has more than 20)

  Total points for Mike: \(21 + 21 + 42 = 84\)

- **Jim**:
  - Points from Round 1: 21 - 3 = 18
  - Points from Round 2: 18 (since he has more than 20)
  - Points from Round 3: 18 + 18 = 36 (because he has more than 20)

  Total points for Jim: \(18 + 18 + 36 = 72\)

- **Tony**:
  - Points from Round 1: 21
  - Points from Round 2: 21 (since he has more than 20)
  - Points from Round 3: 21 + 21 = 42 (because he has more than 20)

  Total points for Tony: \(21 + 21 + 42 = 84\)

### Step 2: Calculate Extra Points for Each Player

In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if their current score is greater than 20.

- **Mike**: 
  - Current score: 84 > 20 → He qualifies for the extra point.
  - Extra points: 1

  New total for Mike: \(84 + 1 = 85\)

- **Jim**:
  - Current score: 72 < 20 → No extra points.

  New total for Jim: \(72\) remains unchanged.

- **Tony**:
  - Current score: 84 > 20 → He qualifies for the extra point.
  - Extra points: 1

  New total for Tony: \(84 + 1 = 85\)

### Step 3: Sum Up All Scores

Now, let's sum up the total scores after considering the extra points.

- **Total points for Mike**: 85
- **Total points for Jim**: 72
- **Total points for Tony**: 85

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{85}
\]<|im_end|>","After 3 rounds Jim has 21 points - 3 points = <<21-3=18>>18 points.

In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.
Only two of them have over 20 points, so in total, all friends have 81 points + 2 points = <<2+81=83>>83 points.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the age of the youngest son.
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.

Calculation for the youngest son's age:
\[ \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{\text{Oldest son's age}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ \text{Youngest son's age} = 4 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges washed.
- There are two sons who will wash the oranges.
- Each son washes an equal number of oranges based on their age.

Since both sons have the same age (4), we can calculate the number of oranges each son washes:
\[ \text{Number of oranges per son} = \text{Son's age} \]
\[ \text{Number of oranges per son} = 4 \]

Total number of oranges washed:
\[ \text{Total oranges washed} = (\text{Number of oranges per son}) \times (\text{Number of sons}) \]
\[ \text{Total oranges washed} = 4 \times 2 \]
\[ \text{Total oranges washed} = 8 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of oranges washed from the initial number of oranges bought.
- Will initially bought 15 oranges.
- He washed 8 oranges.

Calculation for the remaining number of oranges:
\[ \text{Remaining oranges} = (\text{Initial number of oranges}) - (\text{Total oranges washed}) \]
\[ \text{Remaining oranges} = 15 - 8 \]
\[ \text{Remaining oranges} = 7 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The older son washes 8 oranges, so the younger son washes 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

### Day 1:
- Push-ups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell Presses: 20

Total for Day 1 = \(100 + 50 + 20 = 170\)

### Day 2:
- Push-ups: \(100 + 20 = 120\) (since he did 20 more on the second day)
- Squats: \(50 - 10 = 40\) (since he did 10 fewer on the second day)
- Dumbbell Presses: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) (since he doubled the number from the first day)

Total for Day 2 = \(120 + 40 + 40 = 200\)

To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for the given conditions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily consumption of rice per person:**
   - Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal.
   - There are two meals per day (lunch and dinner).
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption per person} = 0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weekly consumption of rice per person:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   \[
   \text{Weekly consumption per person} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of people in the household:**
   - The problem states there are 5 people.

4. **Calculate the total weekly consumption for the entire household:**
   \[
   \text{Total weekly consumption} = 2.8 \, \text{kg/person/week} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 14 \, \text{kg/week}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many weeks the 42 kg bag will last:**
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{14 \, \text{kg/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks**.<|im_end|>","Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.

To determine how many more or fewer crates Sam sold than his target, we need to calculate the total number of crates he actually sold and then compare it to his target.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold over the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).**

- **Weekend Sales**: 
  - Saturday: 20 crates
  - Sunday: 20 crates
  
  Total for the weekend = 20 + 20 = 40 crates

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of crates Sam sold during the weekdays excluding weekends.**

- **Weekday Sales (Monday to Friday)**:
  - Monday: 120 crates (since he was closed)
  - Tuesday: 15 crates
  - Wednesday: 12 crates
  - Thursday: 18 crates
  - Friday: 120 crates (since he was closed)

  Total for weekdays (excluding weekends) = 120 + 15 + 12 + 18 + 120 = 395 crates

**Step 3: Sum up all the sales to find the total for the entire week.**

Total sales for the week = Weekend sales + Weekday sales
= 40 crates (weekend) + 395 crates (weekdays)
= 435 crates

**Step 4: Determine how many crates Sam was off from his target.**

Target: 120 crates per week.
Actual sales: 435 crates

Off target amount = Actual sales - Target
= 435 crates - 120 crates
= 315 crates

Therefore, Sam was off by 315 crates from his target for the week.

To determine the total amount of money Carmen spent during the auction, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of rounds**: Since there are three other bidders who each make one bid before Carmen, there will be four rounds in total (one for each bidder).

2. **Calculate the initial bid**: The first round's bid is $200.

3. **Determine the increase per round**: Each subsequent bid increases by $50.

4. **Calculate the bids made by each person**:
   - **First Round**: $200 (Carmen)
   - **Second Round**: $200 + $50 = $250
   - **Third Round**: $250 + $50 = $300
   - **Fourth Round**: $300 + $50 = $350

5. **Sum up all the bids**: Add up the bids from all participants.
   - Carmen: $200
   - First Bidder: $250
   - Second Bidder: $300
   - Third Bidder: $350
   Total = $200 + $250 + $300 + $350 = $1100

Therefore, the total amount of money that Carmen spent during the auction is $\boxed{1100}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","3 other people are bidding on the desk so there are 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 added to the cost of the desk by other people.
Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.

                    question:
                    John hires a driving service to get him to work each day.  His work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back each day. ?  He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.  He gets charged $2 . per mile driven and he ? also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  How much does he pay a year for driving?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost John incurs for hiring a driving service over the course of one year. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the daily mileage
John drives to work and back every day, so his daily mileage is:
\[ \text{Daily Mileage} = 30 \text{ miles (to work)} + 30 \text{ miles (back home)} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly mileage
Since John works 5 days a week, his weekly mileage is:
\[ \text{Weekly Mileage} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly mileage
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so:
\[ \text{Monthly Mileage} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 1200 \text{ miles/month} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the annual mileage
Given that John works for 50 weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Annual Mileage} = 1200 \text{ miles/month} \times 50 \text{ months/year} = 60,000 \text{ miles/year} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost based on mileage
John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total cost for the mileage is:
\[ \text{Total Cost from Mileage} = 60,000 \text{ miles/year} \times \$2/\text{mile} = \$120,000 \]

### Step 6: Add the bonus
John also receives a $150 bonus per month. Since there are 5 working days in a week and 50 weeks in a year:
\[ \text{Number of Months in a Year} = 50 \text{ weeks/year} \div 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ months/year} \]
\[ \text{Total Monthly Bonus} = \$150 \text{ per month} \times 10 \text{ months/year} = \$1,500 \]

### Final Answer:
Adding the total cost from mileage and the bonus:
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \$120,000 (\text{from mileage}) + \$1,500 (\text{bonus}) = \$121,500 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$121,500}
\]<|im_end|>","He has to travel 30*2=<<30*2=60>>60 miles per day
That means he travels 60*5=<<60*5=300>>300 miles per week

To determine how much Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to meet his goal, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday.
- Peter exercised for 16 minutes on Monday.
- He exercised for 23 minutes on Sunday.

Total time on Monday and Sunday:
\[ 16 \text{ (Monday)} + 23 \text{ (Sunday)} = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Determine how much more time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday compared to Monday and Sunday combined.
Peter's goal is to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.
- Twice the amount of time on Monday and Sunday:
\[ 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes} = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Subtract the total time already spent from the goal to find out how much time Peter still needs to exercise on Tuesday.
\[ 78 \text{ minutes} - 39 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter has to exercise for **39 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.<|im_end|>","On Sunday and Monday he exercised a total of 39 minutes because 23 + 16 = <<23+16=39>>39

                    A simple folding newspaper or tabloid can be made by folding a piece of paper vertically and unfolding. Then, say, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on : the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid after folding it as described, we need to carefully follow the steps:

1. **Fold the Paper Vertically**: Start with one sheet of paper. When you fold this sheet vertically, it becomes two sheets: a front sheet (with page 1) and a back sheet (with pages 2-32).

2. **Unfold the Folded Paper**: Unfold the folded paper. Now you have two separate sheets.

3. **Print Pages**: Print pages 1 and 2 on the front sheet.
   - Page 1 will be printed on the front side of the first sheet.
   - Page 2 will be printed on the front side of the second sheet.

4. **Repeat for Remaining Pages**: Repeat the process for all remaining pages (pages 3-31). Each time you print a new page, add another sheet to the stack.

Let's count the total number of sheets used:

- Initially, there was 1 sheet (front + back).
- After printing page 1, there were 2 sheets.
- After printing page 2, there were 3 sheets.
- After printing pages 3-31, there were 32 sheets.

So, after printing all pages from 1 to 31, you would have used 32 sheets of paper. 

Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{32} pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.<|im_end|>","Each piece prints 4 pages.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much Annika spent on food and snacks**

- Annika started with $50.
- She spent half of her money on food and snacks.

First, we find out what half of $50 is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

**Step 2: Determine how much money she has left after buying food and snacks**

We subtract the amount spent on food and snacks from her initial amount:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

After spending $25 on food and snacks, Annika has $25 left.

**Step 3: Subtract the cost of the rides from the remaining money**

- Annika also spent an additional $10 on rides.

Subtracting the $10 from the remaining $25 gives us:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount left after all expenses is $15.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{15}$.<|im_end|>","She spent 50/2=$<<50/2=25>>25 on the food.

                    question:
                    Elise has been selling her : Dad's . collection of ! 250 books for three years. Each book sells . at 20$, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold : in the current year. There , are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. What's the total amount of money she earned in the second year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Elise earned in the second year based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books sold over all three years.
- Let \( x \) be the total number of books sold in the third year.
- According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year (second year). So, in the first year, she sold \( 2x \) books.
- The total number of books sold over the three years can be represented as:
\[ x + 2x = 3x \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the books.
- Each book sells for $20, so the total revenue is:
\[ 3x \times 20 \]

### Step 3: Set up an equation to find the value of \( x \).
- We know that there are currently 50 unsold books out of a total collection of 250 books. Therefore, the number of books sold is:
\[ 250 - 50 = 200 \]
- Since the total number of books sold is equal to the sum of the books sold in each year, we have:
\[ x + 2x = 200 \]
\[ 3x = 200 \]
\[ x = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the revenue from the first year.
- In the first year, Elise sold \( 2x \) books:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{200}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \approx 133.33 \text{ books} \]
- Revenue from the first year:
\[ 133.33 \times 20 \approx 2666.67 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the revenue from the second year.
- In the second year, Elise sold \( 2x \) books again:
\[ 2x = 2 \times \frac{200}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \approx 133.33 \text{ books} \]
- Revenue from the second year:
\[ \left( \frac{400}{3} \right) \times 20 = \frac{8000}{3} \approx 2666.67 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8000}{3}}
\]<|im_end|>","If her sales in the current year are 45, she sold 45*2 = <<45*2=90>>90 books in the first year.

The total number of books sold in the second year is 250 of the original number of books - 135 sold books - 50 unsold books = <<250-135-50=65>>65 books.

                    Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five : days a week. He earns ! $10 per hour and gets a $300 bonus each week if , the company performs well. How much money did Watson make in April ? if the company performed very well ; for the whole month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to consider his earnings from both his hourly wage and any bonuses he receives based on whether the company performs well or not.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Hours Worked:**
   - Watson works a 10-hour shift every day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, total hours worked in one week = \(10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week}\).

2. **Calculate Weekly Earnings from Hourly Wage:**
   - His hourly wage is $10.
   - Therefore, weekly earnings from hourly wage = \(10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times (10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week})\).
   
3. **Calculate Weekly Bonus:**
   - If the company performs well, he receives a $300 bonus.
   - Since the problem states that the company performed very well, he will receive this bonus.

4. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   - Sum up his weekly earnings from the hourly wage and the bonus.

5. **Convert Weekly Earnings to Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are approximately 4 weeks in a month.
   - Multiply the total weekly earnings by 4 to get the monthly earnings.

6. **Calculate Total Monthly Earnings:**

Let's perform these calculations:

1. **Total Hours Worked in One Week:**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ hours/week}
   \]

2. **Weekly Earnings from Hourly Wage:**
   \[
   10 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 50 \text{ hours/week} = 500 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

3. **Weekly Bonus ($300):**
   \[
   \$300
   \]

4. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   \[
   500 \text{ dollars/week} + 300 \text{ dollars/week} = 800 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

5. **Monthly Earnings (4 weeks/month):**
   \[
   800 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 3200 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

Therefore, Watson made $\boxed{3200}$ in April if the company performed very well throughout the month.<|im_end|>","In a day, Watson makes 10 * 10 = $<<10*10=100>>100
If he works five days a week, the total number of days for the whole month is 5 * 4= <<5*4=20>>20 days.
Since he makes $100 per day, the total amount for the whole month is 20 * 100= $<<20*100=2000>>2000.
He also got a 300 * 4 = $<<300*4=1200>>1200 bonus because the company performed well in all the weeks of April.
At the end of April, he earned 2000 +1200 = $<<2000+1200=3200>>3200.

3. **Determine how many of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon:**
   - Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon.
   
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it would take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, given their different rates of weight loss.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss rate:**
   - Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.
   - Therefore, Joey's weekly weight loss rate = \(\frac{8\text{ pounds}}{4\text{ weeks}} = 2\text{ pounds per week}\).

2. **Calculate the total weight Joey loses over 4 weeks:**
   - Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, his total weight loss after 4 weeks is \(8\text{ pounds}\).

3. **Calculate Sandy's total weight loss needed:**
   - Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, which is 8 pounds.

4. **Determine Sandy's weekly weight loss rate:**
   - Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds.
   - Therefore, Sandy's weekly weight loss rate = \(\frac{8\text{ pounds}}{4\text{ weeks}} = 2\text{ pounds per week}\).

5. **Calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds at her rate:**
   - Since Sandy's weekly weight loss rate is 2 pounds per week, she will lose 8 pounds in \( \frac{8\text{ pounds}}{2\text{ pounds per week}} = 4\text{ weeks}\).

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey.

                    question:
                    A tub of ice cream costing $13 is now sold at $11. A packet ! of ? milk was sold at a discount ? of $0.5. How much will you save if . you buy 2 ? tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the savings on one tub of ice cream.
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings per tub of ice cream = Original price - Discounted price
\[ \text{Savings per tub} = \$13 - \$11 = \$2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total savings for two tubs of ice cream.
- Savings per tub of ice cream: $2
- Number of tubs of ice cream: 2
- Total savings for two tubs of ice cream = Savings per tub × Number of tubs
\[ \text{Total savings for two tubs} = \$2 \times 2 = \$4 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the savings on one packet of milk.
- Price of one packet of milk: Let's denote this as \( P_m \)
- Discount rate: \( D \) (given as $0.5)
- Savings per packet of milk = Price of one packet of milk - Discounted price of one packet of milk
\[ \text{Savings per packet} = P_m - (P_m - D) = D \]
So, the savings per packet of milk is simply the discount rate.

### Step 4: Calculate the total savings for four packets of milk.
- Savings per packet of milk: $0.5
- Number of packets of milk: 4

                    question:
                    , Helena is a mad scientist testing her latest creation, the Lots-of-Limbs Serum. The serum ! will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days ? and an ? extra , leg every five days. After fifteen days, , how many new limbs will Helena’s serum cause a person to grow if they drink it?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many new limbs Helena's serum causes a person to grow after 15 days, we need to calculate the number of arms and legs grown over that period.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of arms grown
- Arms grown per day = 1 (initial) + 1 (extra)
- Number of days = 15
- Total arms grown = (Initial arms + Extra arms per day) × Number of days

Let's break this down:

\[ \text{Total arms} = (1 + 1) \times 15 \]

Calculating the above expression:

\[ \text{Total arms} = 2 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Total arms} = 30 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of legs grown
- Legs grown per day = 1 (initial) + 1 (extra)
- Number of days = 15
- Total legs grown = (Initial legs + Extra legs per day) × Number of days

Let's break this down:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (1 + 1) \times 15 \]

Calculating the above expression:

\[ \text{Total legs} = 2 \times 15 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 30 \]

### Step 3: Sum up total limbs grown
Total limbs grown = Total arms grown + Total legs grown

Substituting our values from Steps 1 and 2:

\[ \text{Total limbs} = 30 + 30 \]
\[ \text{Total limbs} = 60 \]

Therefore, after 15 days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow **60** new limbs.<|im_end|>","At one new arm every 3 days, after 15 days, a person who drank Helena’s serum would grow 15 / 3 = <<15/3=5>>5 extra arms.
At one new leg every 5 days, after 15 days, the person would grow 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 extra legs.
In all, someone who drank Helena’s serum would grow 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 new limbs after 15 days.

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on business suits.
- Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of business suits} = 6 \times \$100 = \$600 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on suitcase(s).
- Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
\[ \text{Total cost of suitcases} = 3 \times \$50 = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the flight ticket.
- The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of one business suit.
\[ \text{Cost of one business suit} = \$100 \]
\[ \text{Cost of five business suits} = 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \text{Cost of the flight ticket} = \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total expenses so far.
- Add up all the amounts calculated above.
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$600 (\text{suits}) + \$150 (\text{suitcases}) + \$1200 (\text{flight ticket}) \]
\[ \text{Total expenses} = \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

### Step 5: Determine how much money Theo still needs to buy gifts for his business partners.
- Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, but he already spent $1950.
\[ \text{Money left after saving} = \$2000 - \$1950 = \$50 \]

Therefore, Theo has to spend **$50** on buying gifts for his business partners.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: $\boxed{\$50}$<|im_end|>","Theo buys business suits for 6 suits * $100/suit = $<<6*100=600>>600.
Theo buys suitcases for 3 suitcases * $50/suitcase = $<<3*50=150>>150.
Theo buys a flight ticket that costs $700 + 5 * $100 = $<<700+5*100=1200>>1200.
Theo can spend $6000 - $600 - $150 - $1200 - $2000 = $<<6000-600-150-1200-2000=2050>>2050 on gifts for his friends.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the daily consumption for the group:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs per day.
   - Two people eat 2 eggs per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed per day by the entire family:**
   - The first group (three people) consumes \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs per day.
   - The second group (two people) consumes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs per day.
   
   Adding these together gives the total daily consumption:
   \[
   9 + 4 = 13 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed over one week (7 days):**
   - Since they eat eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:
   \[
   13 \times 7 = 91 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Therefore, the family will consume a total of 91 eggs in a week.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{91}\).<|im_end|>","Three persons eat 3 x 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 eggs each day.

To determine Trent's age, we need to follow the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the relationship between Trent and Jane:**
   - Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

2. **Identify the relationship between Jane and Quinn:**
   - Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.

Given that Quinn is 30 years old, let's proceed with these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Jane's Age
Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn:
\[ \text{Jane's Age} = \text{Quinn's Age} - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's Age} = 30 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jane's Age} = 27 \]

### Step 2: Determine Trent's Age
Now that we know Jane is 27 years old, we can find out Trent's age:
\[ \text{Trent's Age} = \text{Jane's Age} + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's Age} = 27 + 5 \]
\[ \text{Trent's Age} = 32 \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current population of Chile based on the given information about Noah's age and the relationship between the populations of Chile and Noah.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's current age.
   - According to the problem, six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, she was 40 years old six years ago (because \( 46 - 6 = 40 \)).
   - Therefore, six years ago, Noah was \( \frac{N}{2} \).

2. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time.
   - So, the population of Chile six years ago was \( 3000 \times \frac{N}{2} \).

3. **Use the population information from six years ago:**
   - We know the population of Chile six years ago was also equal to half its current population. Let \( P \) be the current population of Chile.
   - Thus, the population six years ago can be expressed as \( \frac{P}{2} \).

4. **Set up an equation using the information from step 2 and step 3:**
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times \frac{N}{2}
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 3000 \times \frac{N}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 1500N
   \]
   \[
   P = 3000N
   \]

6. **Find Noah's current age \( N \):**
   - Noah's age six years ago was \( \frac{N}{2} \).
   - The total number of years since Noah's birth is \( N \), so his age today is \( N + \text{age six years ago} \):
     \[
     N + \frac{N}{2} = N + \frac{N}{2} = \frac{3N}{2}
     \]
   - Given that Noah's current age is \( N \), he must have been born in the year \( N \).

7. **Substitute Noah's current age into the equation for the population:**
   - Substitute \( N \) for Noah's current age into \( P = 3000N \):
     \[
     P = 3000N
     \]

8. **Calculate the current population of Chile:**
   - Using the derived formula for \( P \), substitute back:
     \[
     P = 3000N
     \]

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - Given that Noah’s current age \( N \) can be determined by solving the equations involving his age six years ago and the population of Chile, and knowing that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times Noah's age at that time, we find:

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To solve this problem, let's define variables to represent the number of players in different positions:

- Let \( D \) be the number of players on the defense.
- Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, the number of offensive players is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

According to the problem, the total number of players on the team is 105. Therefore, we can write an equation representing the sum of all players:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:

\[ D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

Solve for \( D \):

\[ 7D = 210 \]
\[ D = \frac{210}{7} \]
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of players on the defense

To determine how many people will attend Martha's Christmas party, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people initially invited.**

- Each family consists of 6 or 4 people.
- There are 2 families with 6 people each.

First calculate the total number of people from these two families:
\[ \text{Total from first type of families} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, consider the three different types of families with 4 people each:
\[ \text{Total from second type of families} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Now sum both groups together:
\[ \text{Total initial invitations} = 12 + 12 = 24 \]

**Step 2: Adjust for those who cannot attend due to illness.**

Eight people could not make it because of illness:
\[ \text{People unable to attend due to illness} = 8 \]

Subtract this number from the initial total:
\[ \text{Adjusted total} = 24 - 8 = 16 \]

**Step 3: Account for those with prior commitments.**

One quarter (or 25%) of the guests originally invited had previous commitments:
\[ \text{Number with prior commitments} = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6 \]

Subtract this number from the adjusted total:
\[ \text{Final adjusted total} = 16 - 6 = 10 \]

To determine how much it costs to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
First, let's find out the total volume of the pool.

Given dimensions:
- Length (L) = 6 feet
- Width (W) = 4 feet
- Depth (D) = 5 feet

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which the pool can be considered as) is:
\[ V = L \times W \times D \]

Substitute the given values into the equation:
\[ V = 6 \text{ ft} \times 4 \text{ ft} \times 5 \text{ ft} \]
\[ V = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

So, the volume of the pool is **120 cubic feet**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost to fill the pool.
We know that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool.

To find the total cost, multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = Volume \times \text{Cost per Cubic Foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \times \$0.1/\text{cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$12.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is **$12.00**.

### Final Answer:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of girls in the classroom.
Given that there are 3 times as many girls as boys, we can start by finding out how many girls there are based on the number of boys provided.

- We know there are 30 boys.
- According to the given ratio, if there are 3 times as many girls as boys, then the number of girls is \(3 \times 30\).

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So far, we have 30 boys and 90 girls.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of non-gendered children.
We're told that there is 1/10 as many non-gendered children as there are boys.

- Given that there are 30 boys, we calculate the number of non-gendered children:

\[ \text{Number of non-gendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 \]

\[ \text{Number of non-gendered children} = 3 \]

### Step 3: Verify the total number of children.
Now, let's add up all the children in the classroom:

- Boys: 30
- Girls: 90
- Non-gendered children: 3

Total number of children:

\[ \text{Total children} = 30 (\text{boys}) + 90 (\text{girls}) + 3 (\text{non-gendered children}) \]

\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

**The final answer is:** The total number of children in the classroom is **123**.<|im_end|>","The classroom has 3 * 30 boys = <<3*30=90>>90 girls.
The classroom has 1/10 nongendered children so 10/100 * 30 boys = <<10/100*30=3>>3 nongendered children.
In total the classroom has 90 + 30 + 3 = <<90+30+3=123>>123 students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of electric poles based on the given ratio and the total number of electric wires.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio**:
   - The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
   - This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

2. **Given Data**:
   - Total number of electric wires = 45

3. **Determine the Number of Poles per Wire**:
   - Since the ratio is 1:3 (polar to wire), if you have 3 wires, you must also have 1 pole.

4. **Calculate the Number of Poles Based on Wires**:
   - We know that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole.
   - Therefore, if there are 45 wires, we can divide them into groups of 3 to find out how many poles they represent.

\[
\text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Total number of wires}}{\text{Ratio of wires to poles}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Number of poles} = 15
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is \boxed{15}.<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Counting**:
   - There are initially 25 men.
   - There are initially 15 women.

2. **Total Initial Number of People**:
   \[
   \text{Total initial number} = 25 \text{ (men)} + 15 \text{ (women)} = 40 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **People Leaving**:
   - After one hour, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people leave.
   - Therefore, \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) people leave.

4. **Remaining Men**:
   - Given that 22 men stay at the party after some time,
   - The remaining men must be from those who left minus the ones that stayed.
   - Since all men left except for the 22 that stayed, we need to determine how many men left in total first.
   - Let \( M_{\text{left}} \) be the number of men who left.
   - We know that \( \frac{M_{\text{left}}}{40} \times 40 = 10 \), so \( M_{\text{left}} = 10 \).

5. **Number of Women Left**:
   - Initially, there were 15 women.
   - If 10 people left, then out of these, women make up \( \frac{1}{4} \) because the total leaves are divided equally among men and women.
   - So, the number of women who left is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 10 = 2.5 \approx 2 \text{ women (since we can't have half a person)}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of women left is:
     \[
     15 - 2 = 13
     \]

So, the number of women left at the party is \( 13 \).<|im_end|>","There were a total of 25 men + 15 women = <<25+15=40>>40 people who attended the party.

This means 40 people - 10 people = <<40-10=30>>30 people stayed.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes Jam has:**
   - Jam has 3 boxes.
   - We know that Jam + Meg = 26 pencils in total.

2. **Calculate the number of pencils Jam needs to add for Meg's 46 pencils:**
   - Since Jam already has 26 pencils, we need to find out how many more pencils are needed for Meg's 46 pencils.
   \[
   \text{Pencils needed for Meg} = 46 - 26 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of boxes needed:**
   - Each box contains 20 pencils (since 20 pencils per box).
   - To find out how many boxes are needed for 20 pencils, divide the total pencils needed by the number of pencils per box.
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total pencils needed}}{\text{Pencils per box}} = \frac{20}{20} = 1

                    question:
                    Shannon makes herself iced coffee ? by brewing hot coffee and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees but makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Any added liquid also weakens the coffee. How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds ; 15 milliliters of cream?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the process into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between temperature decrease and coffee strength loss
Shannon's iced coffee loses strength as its temperature decreases. The cooling effect from ice cubes alone (each reducing the coffee's strength by 13 degrees) needs to be considered.

### Step 2: Calculate the total reduction in coffee strength due to ice cube cooling
Each ice cube reduces the coffee's strength by 13 degrees for every 1 degree Celsius drop in temperature. Since there are no other liquids being added that would further reduce the coffee's strength, we can focus on the cooling effect solely from the ice cubes.

Given:
- Temperature dropped by 65 degrees
- Each ice cube reduces strength by 13 degrees per 1 degree Celsius drop

First, calculate how many ice cubes will cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
\[ \text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

Now, multiply the number of ice cubes by the strength loss per ice cube:
\[ \text{Total strength loss due to ice cubes} = 5 \times 13 = 65 \text{ degrees} \]

### Step 3: Consider the additional weakening effect caused by cream
Cream adds an extra weakening factor to the coffee. Given:
- Added cream increases the coffee's weakness by 12 milliliters for every 10 milliliters of coffee.

Since the coffee initially has some volume before adding the cream (which we assume to be negligible or already accounted for), the addition of 15 milliliters of cream does not significantly change the overall volume but increases the weakening effect.

Calculate the weakening effect due to the cream:
\[ \text{Weakening effect due to cream} = \left(\frac{15 \text{ ml}}{10 \text{ ml}}\right) \times 12 \text{ ml} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ ml} \]

### Step 4: Combine all effects to determine the final strength loss
Add the effects together:
\[ \text{Final strength loss} = 65 + 36 = 101 \text{ ml} \]

### Final Answer
The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Shannon’s iced coffee has 65 / 13 = <<65/13=5>>5 ice cubes in it.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Understand the trading rules
Ralph has a record store where people can exchange two old records for one new record.

### Step 2: Determine the net number of records exchanged per transaction
For every 3 records (2 old + 1 new), a total of 3 records are traded out of the system.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of records traded away
If 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records, then the total number of records traded away is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ records per person} = 15 \text{ records} \]

### Step 4: Work backwards to find the initial number of records
Since we know that 15 records were traded away, and each time only 3 records are added back into the system, we need to determine how many times these exchanges have occurred.
\[ \frac{15 \text{ records}}{3 \text{ records per exchange}} = 5 \text{ exchanges} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the initial number of records brought in
Initially, there must have been more than 15 records because after 5 exchanges, they end up with 7 new records.
Let \( x \) be the initial number of records brought in by the 5 people.
After exchanging, they should have 7 new records left, so initially, they had:
\[ x - 5 \times 3 = 7 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ x - 15 = 7 \]
\[ x = 7 + 15 \]
\[ x = 22 \]

Therefore, the 5 people brought in **22** old records.<|im_end|>","People can bring in 2 old records = get 1 new record.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of junior programmers.
2. Calculate the number of senior programmers based on the given ratio.
3. Find out how much each senior programmer earns.
4. Calculate the total earnings from both junior and senior programmers.

### Step 1: Determine the number of junior programmers
We know that the number of junior programmers is \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total number of employees. The total number of employees is 100.

\[
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers
Since there are 100 employees in total and 40 of them are junior programmers, the remaining must be senior programmers.

\[
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Find out how much each senior programmer earns
Senior programmers earn $400 more than junior programmers. Given that junior programmers earn $2000 per month, we can calculate the monthly earning for senior programmers as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings per senior programmer} = \$2000 + \$400 = \$2400
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month
First, find the total earnings for junior programmers:

\[
\text{Total earnings for junior programmers} = 40 \times \$2000 = \$80,000
\]

Next, find the total earnings for senior programmers:

\[
\text{Total earnings for senior programmers} = 60 \times \$2400 = \$144,000
\]

Finally, add these two amounts together to get the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[
\text{Total amount of money} = \$80,000 + \$144,000 = \$224,000
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of passengers**: Let's denote the initial number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

2. **First bus stop**:
   - At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on.
   - The total number of people after the first stop would be \( x + 5 \).

3. **Second bus stop**:
   - After the first stop, if we assume that all these people continue their journey (since no one gets off), they will still have \( x + 5 \) people.
   - At the second bus stop, 7 people get off and 8 more people get on.
   - So, the net change from the previous stop is \( -7 + 8 = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of people after the second stop would be \( (x + 5) + 1 = x + 6 \).

4. **Total number of passengers at the third stop**:
   - According to the problem, the total number of people heading to the third stop is 20.
   - This means \( x + 6 = 20 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - From the equation \( x + 6 = 20 \), subtract 6 from both sides: \( x = 20 - 6 \).
   - Simplify: \( x = 14 \).

So, the final answer is {The final answer is} 14.<|im_end|>","There were 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 people on the bus before 8 people got in at the second stop.

### Step 2: Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School
He eats 2 lollipops on the way to school.

\[ \text{Lollipops left after eating} = 24 - 2 = 22 \]

### Step 3: Lollipops Passed Out
He gives away 14 lollipops to his friends.

\[ \text{Lollipops left after giving away} = 22 - 14 = 8 \]

### Step 4: Lollipops Bought at Home
He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends.

\[ \text{Number of lollipops bought} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

\[ \text{Total lollipops before eating} = 8 + 28 = 36 \]

### Step 5: Lollipops Eaten After Buying
After buying more lollipops, he eats 3 more during the night.

\[ \text{Lollipops eaten after buying} = 3 \]

\[ \text{Lollipops left after eating} = 36 - 3 = 33 \]

### Step 6: Additional Lollipops Eaten in the Morning
Finally, he eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.

                    question:
                    The cell-phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes. Now, the phone is ? at 60% charged. How long will it take to fully charge, in hours?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understand the charging rate
The cell phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes.

### Step 2: Determine the current state
The cell phone is currently at 60% charged.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining charge needed
Since the full charge is 100%, and the current charge is 60%, the remaining charge needed is:
\[ \text{Remaining Charge} = 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

### Step 4: Calculate the time required for the remaining charge
Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point every 3 minutes, we need to find out how many 3-minute intervals are required to reach the remaining 40%.

First, convert the percentage into a number of minutes:
\[ \text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Remaining Charge}}{\text{Charge Rate}} = \frac{40}{1} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours
There are 60 minutes in an hour. So, to convert 40 minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Total Time (hours)} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ hours} \]

### Conclusion
It will take approximately \( \frac{2}{3} \) hours to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{2}{3} \text{ hours}} \]<|im_end|>","100-60=<<100-60=40>>40 percentage points.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many lollipops Erin initially has.
2. Calculate how many more lollipops Erin's mother gives her.
3. Add the number of lollipops given by her mother to the initial amount.
4. Subtract the number of lollipops Erin gives away from the total.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Initial Lollipops
Erin starts with 7 lollipops.

### Step 2: Additional Lollipops from Mother
Her mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops.

### Step 3: Total After Receiving More Lollipops
We add the 10 lollipops from her mother to the 7 lollipops she already had:
\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \]

So, Erin now has **17** lollipops after receiving them from her mother.

### Step 4: Lollipops Given Away
Erin then gives 3 lollipops to Ella.

### Final Calculation
Subtract the 3 lollipops that Erin gave to Ella from her current total:
\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of reward points earned from the previous shopping trip.
- The customer's spending was $80.
- They get $1 off for every $20 spent.

\[
\text{Number of reward points} = \frac{\$80}{\$20} = 4 \times \$1 = 4 \text{ (since } \$1 \text{ off per } \$20)
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much the customer can use as a discount after applying the rewards.
- After using all 4 rewards, the total discount is calculated as follows:
  
\[
\text{Total discount} = 4 \times \$1 = \$4
\]

### Step 3: Apply the coupon which takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
- Since the customer already used 4 rewards worth $1 each, the coupon will take out twice that value.

\[
\text{Coupon value} = 2 \times \$1 = \$2
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the coupon value from the total discount to find out how much the customer saves in terms of money.

\[
\text{Total savings} = \$4 - \$2 = \$2
\]

### Step 5: Subtract the saved amount from the original spending to determine how much the customer actually paid.

\[
\text{Amount spent} = \$80 - \$2 = \$78
\]

Therefore, the final amount the customer paid on this shopping trip is **$78**.<|im_end|>","The customer had 80 / 20 = $<<80/20=4>>4 in rewards.

                    question:
                    Nick is choosing ? between two jobs. Job A ; pays $15 an hour for 2000 : hours a year, and is in a state with a 20% total tax rate.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much more money Nick would make at the job with the higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both jobs and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual salary for Job A

Job A offers $15 per hour for 2000 hours annually.
\[
\text{Annual Salary}_A = \$15 \times 2000 = \$30,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the taxes and net pay for Job A

- **State Tax Rate**: 20%
- **Property Tax**: $6,000

First, let's calculate the total taxes (state + property tax):
\[
\text{Total Taxes} = \$30,000 \times 0.20 + \$6,000 = \$6,000 + \$6,000 = \$12,000
\]

Next, subtract the taxes from the annual salary to find the net pay:
\[
\text{Net Pay}_A = \$30,000 - \$12,000 = \$18,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the annual salary for Job B

Job B offers $42,000 per year.

### Step 4: Calculate the property tax and net pay for Job B

- **Property Tax**: $6,000
- **State Tax Rate**: 10%

Calculate the net income before taxes:
\[
\text{Net Income Before Taxes}_B = \$42,000 - \$6,000 = \$36,000
\]

Now, apply the state tax rate to this amount:
\[
\text{Taxes}_B = \$36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600
\]

Subtract the taxes from the net income before taxes to get the net pay:
\[
\text{Net Pay}_B = \$36,000 - \$3,600 = \$32,400
\]

### Step 5: Compare the net pay rates

- Net Pay for Job A: \$18,000
- Net Pay for Job B: \$32,400

Difference in net pay:
\[
\text{Difference} = \$32,400 - \$18,000 = \$14,400
\]

Therefore, Nick will make $\boxed{\$14,400}$ more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job.<|im_end|>","First calculate the gross annual salary for Job A: 2000 hours * $15/hour = $<<2000*15=30000>>30,000

Now subtract Nick's taxes from his net pay to find his gross pay at Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $<<30000-6000=24000>>24,000
Now subtract Nick's property taxes from his gross income at Job B: $42,000 - $6,000 = $<<42000-6000=36000>>36,000
Now multiply Nick's income after property tax by 10% to find his income tax at Job B: $36,000 * 10% = $<<36000*10*.01=3600>>3,600
Now subtract the income tax amount from Nick's earnings after property tax to find his net income at Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $<<36000-3600=32400>>32,400

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ruined castles:**
   - We know that 40% of the 220 castles are ruins.
   - To find out how many castles are ruins, multiply the total number of castles by the percentage (in decimal form):
     \[
     220 \times 0.40 = 88
     \]
   So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. **Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles:**
   - Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Therefore, divide the number of ruined castles by 2:
     \[
     \frac{88}{2} = 44

To determine the cost difference between the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer separately and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer.
- **Advance Payment**: $1,350
- **Monthly Installments**: 6 payments at $350 each

Total cost = Advance Payment + (Number of Monthly Payments * Monthly Payment)
= $1,350 + (6 × $350)
= $1,350 + $2,100
= $3,450

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer.
- **Advance Payment**: $1,100
- **Monthly Installments**: 9 payments at $250 each

Total cost = Advance Payment + (Number of Monthly Payments * Monthly Payment)
= $1,100 + (9 × $250)
= $1,100 + $2,250
= $3,350

### Step 3: Determine the cost difference between the two offers.

   - Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   - Initial total value = \( 8 \times 8 = \$64 \).

2. **Determine the new stock price after the increase:**
   - The stock price increases by 50%. 
   - Increase factor = 1 + 0.50 = 1.50 (or 150%).
   - New stock price = \( 8 \times 1.50 = \$12 \) per share.

3. **Calculate the total value of the shares after the increase:**
   - Number of shares = 8.
   - Total value after increase = \( 8 \times 12 = \$96 \).

4. **Determine the decrease in stock price:**
   - The stock price decreases by 25%.
   - Decrease factor = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 (or 75%).

Let's break down this problem step by step.

1. **Luke's Hot Dogs:**
   - Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
   
2. **Thomas' Hot Dogs:**
   - Thomas ate three times as many hot dogs as Luke.
   - Since Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we calculate Thomas' hot dogs as follows:
     \[
     \text{Thomas' hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

3. **John's Hot Dogs:**
   - John ate half the amount that Thomas ate.
   - Since Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, we calculate John's hot dogs as follows:
     \[
     \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{\text{Thomas' hot dogs}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]

4. **Difference in Hot Dogs between John and Luke:**
   - To find out how many more hot dogs John ate compared to Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate:
     \[
     \text{More hot dogs John ate} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs}

                    question:
                    A class of 200 students is split into 3 groups such , that 2 of them are equal in number and the last one (which is the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups. How many students are in this ? (smallest) group?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are in the smallest group given the conditions.

Let's denote the number of students in the three groups as follows:
- Group A: \( x \)
- Group B: \( x \)
- Group C: \( y \)

According to the problem:
1. The total number of students is 200.
   \[
   x + x + y = 200
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2x + y = 200
   \]

2. Group C has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.
   \[
   y = x - 10
   \]

Now, substitute \( y \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]
Simplify:
\[
2x + x - 10 = 200
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]
Add 10 to both sides:
\[
3x = 210
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
x = 70
\]

Now, use \( x \) to find \( y \):
\[
y = x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

So, the number of students in the smallest group (Group C) is 60.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 60 students.<|im_end|>","If 10 is added to the smallest group (hence to the total number of students), it would make all 3 groups equal to give (200+10)/3 = <<(200+10)/3=70>>70 in each group.
Now taking the 10 away from one group gives the number of the smallest group as 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 students.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that the total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 60:
     \[
     C + K = 60
     \]
   - It is also given that there are twice as many chickens as cows:
     \[
     C = 2K
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First Equation:**
   - Substitute \( C = 2K \) into \( C + K = 60 \):
     \[
     2K + K = 60
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     3K = 60
     \]
   - Solve for \( K \):
     \[
     K = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]
   - Now substitute \( K = 20 \) back into \( C = 2K \):
     \[
     C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Legs:**
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, so:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from chickens} = 40 \times 2 = 80
     \]
   - Cows have 4 legs each, so:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from cows} = 20 \times 4 = 80
     \]
   - Add both totals to get the combined number of legs:
     \[
     80 (\text{chicken legs}) + 80 (\text{cow legs}) = 160
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The total number of legs of all the animals together is:
   \[
   \boxed{160}

                    question:
                    Josh decides to take up juggling to perform at the school talent show a month in the future.  He , starts off practicing juggling 3 ? balls, and slowly gets better adding 1 ball to ! his juggling act each week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the number of balls Josh has after slipping during the fourth week, let's break down the process:

1. **Initial Practice:**
   - Josh starts by practicing juggling 3 balls.

2. **Progression over Weeks:**
   - Each week, Josh adds 1 more ball to his juggling routine.
   - The first week: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - The second week: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - The third week: 5 + 1 = 6 balls
   - The fourth week: 6 + 1 = 7 balls

So, after the fourth week, Josh will have practiced for four weeks and thus be juggling with 7 balls.

3. **After Slip During Fourth Week:**
   - When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls.
   - Out of these 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd.
   - This leaves Josh with 1 ball that was not caught.

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has before performing at the talent show is **7**. 

{The final answer is} 7 balls.<|im_end|>","Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks for a total of 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7

                    question:
                    ! A pink frog weighs the : same as a blue beetle, the same as a green toad, 10 pounds less than ! a yellow snake, but 20 pounds more than a red bird.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal based on the given information and then find the total weight when one of each animal (including the container) is included.

Step 1: Determine the weight of the blue beetle.
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it's the same as a blue beetle.
- Therefore, the blue beetle weighs 50 pounds.

Step 2: Determine the weight of the green toad.
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it's the same as a green toad.
- Therefore, the green toad weighs 50 pounds.

Step 3: Determine the weight of the yellow snake.
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it's 10 pounds less than a yellow snake.
- Let \( W_s \) be the weight of the yellow snake.
- We can set up the equation: 
\[ 50 = W_s - 10 \]
Solving for \( W_s \):
\[ W_s = 50 + 10 = 60 \]
Therefore, the yellow snake weighs 60 pounds.

Step 4: Determine the weight of the red bird.
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds and it's 20 pounds more than a red bird.
- Let \( W_b \) be the weight of the red bird.
- We can set up the equation:
\[ 50 = W_b + 20 \]
Solving for \( W_b \):
\[ W_b = 50 - 20 = 30 \]
Therefore, the red bird weighs 30 pounds.

Step 5: Calculate the total weight of the container and all animals together.
- The container itself weighs 20 pounds.
- Add the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird:
\[ 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 280 \]

Final Answer:
The total weight of the container and all animals together is **280 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle and a green toad, if the weight of the pick frog is 50 pounds, the three animals weigh 3*50 = 150 pounds together.
The pink frog also weighs 10 pounds less than a yellow snake, meaning the weight of the yellow snake is 50+10 = <<50+10=60>>60 pounds.
If you add the weight of the frog, the blue beetle, the green toad, and the yellow snake together, all the animals minus the red bird will have a total weight of 60+150 = <<60+150=210>>210 pounds.
The pink frog's weight is also 20 pounds more than a red bird, meaning the red bird weighs 50-20 = <<50-20=30>>30 pounds.
All the animals weigh a total of 30+210 = <<30+210=240>>240 pounds
If the animals are in a container weighing 20 pounds, the total weight of the full container is 240+20 = 260 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many outfits Laurel received at the baby shower.
- Laurel received twice the amount of baby outfits from her friend compared to what she had before.
- She originally had 24 baby outfits.

So, if she received twice this amount:
\[ \text{Outfits from friend} = 2 \times 24 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of outfits after receiving from her friend.
- We know that she initially had 24 outfits and then got twice as much more.

Therefore:
\[ \text{Total outfits after friends gift} = 24 + (2 \times 24) \]

### Step 3: Add the outfits given by Laurel's mom.
- Her mom gave her 15 additional outfits.

So we add these 15 outfits to the total number obtained in Step 2.

### Step 4: Compute the final total number of outfits.
Now let's do the calculations:
1. Outfits from friend:
   \[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
   
2. Total after friends gift:
   \[ 24 + 48 = 72 \]

3. Adding the outfits from mom:
   \[ 72 + 15 = 87 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the additional distance Tyson would run**

Tyson runs 5000 meters per day. According to his coach, he should run \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more than his usual amount.

\[
\text{Additional distance} = 5000 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{5}\right)
\]

First, simplify inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

Now multiply:

\[
5000 \times \frac{6}{5} = 5000 \times 1.2 = 6000 \text{ meters}
\]

So, Tyson will run an additional 6000 meters per day.

**Step 2: Calculate the new daily running distance**

Add the additional distance to his original daily running distance:

\[
\text{New daily running distance} = 5000 + 6000 = 11000 \text{ meters}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered over a month (30 days)**

Multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in a month:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 11000 \times 30 = 330000 \text{ meters}
\]

**Final Answer**
Therefore, if Tyson followed his coach’s advice and ran 1/5 times more meters each day for a month, he would cover a total distance of **330,000 meters**.<|im_end|>","Tyson's coach wants him to run 1/5 * 5000 meters = <<5000/5=1000>>1000 more meters per day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total number of legs in the restaurant, we need to consider both types of tables: those with 4 legs and those with 3 legs.

Step 1: Determine how many tables have 4 legs.
Since there are 40 tables in total and 50% (or half) of them will be the ones with 4 legs, we can find this number by calculating 2/3 of the total number of tables:

\[ \text{Number of tables with 4 legs} = \frac{2}{3} \times 40 \]

Calculating this gives us:

\[ \text{Number of tables with 4 legs} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \]

Since the number of tables must be an integer, let’s round down to the nearest whole number because partial tables don't exist in reality.

\[ \text{Number of tables with 4 legs} = 26 \]

Step 2: Determine how many tables have 3 legs.
Since all remaining tables are assumed to have 3 legs:

\[ \text{Number of tables with 3 legs} = 40 - 26 \]
\[ \text{Number of tables with 3 legs} = 14 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 4 legs.
Each table with 4 legs contributes 4 legs. So, multiply the number of such tables by 4:

\[ \text{Total legs from tables with 4 legs} = 26 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Total legs from tables with 4 legs} = 104 \]

Step 4: Calculate the total number of legs for the tables with 3 legs.
Each table with 3 legs contributes 3 legs. So, multiply the number of such tables by 3:

\[ \text{Total legs from tables with 3 legs} = 14 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total legs from tables with 3 legs} = 42 \]

Step 5: Add the two results together to get the total number of legs.

\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 104 + 42 \]
\[ \text{Total number of legs} = 146 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is **146**.<|im_end|>","The total number of legs which the tables with four legs have is 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 legs

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate total number of cookies bought**

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies per week.
- Each bag contains 36 cookies.

Therefore,
\[ \text{Total cookies bought} = 1 \times 36 = 36 \]

**Step 2: Calculate how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box per week**

She puts 4 cookies in his lunch box every day he goes to school.
- She goes to school 5 days a week.

Therefore,
\[ \text{Cookies put in lunch box per week} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many cookies Jenny's husband eats per week**

Her husband eats 1 cookie per day for 7 days.
- He eats 1 cookie/day × 7 days/week.

Therefore,
\[ \text{Cookies eaten by husband per week} = 1 \times 7 = 7 \]

**Step 4: Calculate how many cookies are left after accounting for what Jenny's family consumes**

Subtract the number of cookies put in the lunch box from the total cookies bought.
- Subtract the number of cookies eaten by her husband.

Therefore,
\[ \text{Cookies left} = 36 - (20 + 7) \]
\[ \text{Cookies left} = 36 - 27 \]
\[ \text{Cookies left} = 9 \]

**Step 5: Determine how many cookies Jenny eats**

Since there are 9 cookies left and Jenny buys 1 bag containing 36 cookies, we can deduce that Jenny eats all 36 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 36}}

To determine how much Davos paid for the two shirts after the discount, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost before any discount:**
   - Each shirt costs $30.
   - Davos bought 2 shirts.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \times \$30 = \$60
   \]

2. **Apply the 40% discount to the total cost:**

   First, calculate the amount of the discount:

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 0.40 \times \$60 = \$24
   \]

   Then, subtract the discount amount from the original total cost:

                    question:
                    A factory used to make tractors, but now makes silos. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. Now, they sell 5 silos a day, and , make $220 per silo. What percentage more are they making per ! day now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage increase in profit per day, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the daily profit from tractors
- Number of tractors sold per day: 10
- Profit per tractor: $100

\[
\text{Daily profit from tractors} = \text{Number of tractors} \times \text{Profit per tractor}
\]

\[
\text{Daily profit from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = \$1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily profit from silos
- Number of silos sold per day: 5
- Profit per silo: $220

\[
\text{Daily profit from silos} = \text{Number of silos} \times \text{Profit per silo}
\]

\[
\text{Daily profit from silos} = 5 \times 220 = \$1100
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total daily profit before switching products
Let's assume the initial profit per day was calculated based on the number of tractors sold.

If we denote the total daily profit as \( P_{\text{total}} \):

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 10 \times 100 + 5 \times 220
\]

\[
P_{\text{total}} = 1000 + 1100 = \$2100
\]

### Step 4: Determine the new total daily profit after switching to selling silos
Now that the factory sells silos instead of tractors, let's calculate the new total daily profit.

\[
\text{New Total Daily Profit} = 5 \times 220 = \$1100
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage increase in profit per day
The formula for percentage change is:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 2100}{2100} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{-1000}{2100} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( -\frac{1000}{2100} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( -\frac{10}{21} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = -\frac{1000}{21} \% 
\]

Since we want the absolute value of the increase:

\[
\text{Absolute Increase} = \frac{1000}{21} \% \approx 47.62\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The factory is making approximately **47.62%** more money per day when they sell silos compared to when they were making tractors.<|im_end|>","They used to make $1,000 a day because 10 x 100 = <<10*100=1000>>1,000

They make 10% more per day because 1000 +(1000 x (X/100)) = 1,100 if X = 10

                    Every month, Madeline , has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog. Food costs $25 per ! week. Treats cost $20 per month. Medicine ! costs $100 ; per month. How much money does Madeline spend on her dog ? per year if there are 4 weeks in a month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog over a year, we need to break down the costs into monthly expenses and then convert those to annual amounts.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate Monthly Costs:**
   - **Food**: 
     \[
     \text{Cost per week} = \$25
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of weeks in a month} = 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Monthly Cost (Food)} = \$25 \times 4 = \$100
     \]

   - **Treats**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per month} = \$20
     \]

   - **Medicine**:
     \[
     \text{Cost per month} = \$100
     \]

2. **Sum up all monthly costs**:
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$100 (\text{Food}) + \$20 (\text{Treats}) + \$100 (\text{Medicine})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Cost} = \$220
   \]

3. **Convert yearly costs from monthly to annual costs**:
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost (Total)} = \$220 \times 12 = \$2640
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$2640}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of hours Peyton's after-work activities will take, we need to calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Yoga Class (Monday):**
   - Duration: 1 hour

2. **Cooking Class (Wednesday):**
   - The cooking class lasts three times as long as the yoga class.
   - Calculation: \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours

3. **Cheese-Tasting Event (Wednesday):**
   - Duration: Half an hour

4. **Museum Tour (Thursday):**
   - The museum tour takes half as long as the cooking class.
   - Calculation: \(0.5 \div 3 = \frac{1}{6}\) hours

5. **Errands (Friday):**
   - Duration: Two hours

Now, let's add up the durations:

- Yoga class: 1 hour
- Cooking class: 3 hours
- Cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours
- Museum tour: \(\frac{1}{6}\) hours
- Errands: 2 hours

Summing these up:

\[1 + 3 + 0.5 + \frac{1}{6} + 2\]

First, convert all values to have a common denominator for easier addition:

\[1 = \frac{6}{6}, \quad 3 = \frac{18}{6}, \quad 0.5 = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}, \quad \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{6}, \quad 2 = \frac{12}{6}\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[\frac{6}{6} + \frac{18}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{12}{6}\]

Add the fractions:

\[\frac{6 + 18 + 3 + 1 + 12}{6} = \frac{30}{6} = 5\]

Therefore, the total time for all Peyton's after-work activities is:

The final answer is 5 hours.<|im_end|>","Peyton’s cooking class will last 3 * 1 = <<3*1=3>>3 hours.
The museum tour will take 3 / 2 = 1 1/2 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses**
- April needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- She also needs twice as many for the roses.

\[ \text{Number of rose pots} = 2 \times \text{Number of daisy pots} \]

Substitute the given value for the daisy pots:

\[ \text{Number of rose pots} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plant pots needed**
- Total pots needed = Pots for daisies + Pots for roses

\[ \text{Total pots needed} = 30 (\text{daisies}) + 60 (\text{roses}) = 90 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total needed from the initial amount purchased**
- Initial amount purchased = 100 pots

\[ \text{Pots left over} = 100 (\text{initial purchase}) - 90 (\text{total needed}) \]

Calculate the result:

\[ \text{Pots left over} = 100 - 90 = 10 \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 10}
\]<|im_end|>","For the roses, the school wants 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 plant pots.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Andrea had initially**:
   Let's denote the initial amount of money Andrea had as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the cost of the sweater**:
   Andrea spent $11 on an sweater.

3. **Determine how much money Andrea had left after buying the sweater**:
   After spending $11, Andrea has \( x - 11 \) dollars left.

4. **Account for the money given to her brother**:
   Andrea gave $4 to her brother.
   
5. **Set up the equation based on the remaining information**:
   According to the problem, after all these transactions, Andrea still had $36 left.

   So we can write the equation:
   \[
   (x - 11) - 4 = 36
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   x - 15 = 36

To determine how much time John spent sightseeing, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Boating Time:**
   - John spent 6 hours boating.

2. **Swimming Time:**
   - Swimming takes half the time as boating.
   - Half of 6 hours = \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.

3. **Total Boating and Swimming Time:**
   - Total time for boating and swimming = 6 + 3 = 9 hours.

4. **Watching Shows Time:**
   - John watched three different shows, each lasting 2 hours.
   - Total time watching shows = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours.

5. **Time Spent Watching Shows (as %):**
   - The total time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time John spent on his trip.
   - Let \( T \) be the total time spent on his trip.
   - According to the given information, \( 0.3T = 6 \) hours.
   
   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Time Spent Sightseeing:**
   - John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing.
   - Therefore, time spent sightseeing = \( 0.4T \).

7. **Calculating Sightseeing Time:**
   - Substitute \( T \) from the previous calculation:
   \[
   \text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.4 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is \( \boxed{8 \text{ hours}} \).<|im_end|>","He spent 6/2=<<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming

To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, let's break down her current situation:

1. **Current Savings**: Annabelle already has $80 saved.

2. **First Job Earnings**:
   - Hourly wage: $10
   - Hours worked: 20
   - Total earnings from the first job = $10/hour × 20 hours = $200

3. **Second Job Earnings**:
   - Hourly wage: $5
   - Hours worked: 15
   - Total earnings from the second job = $5/hour × 15 hours = $75

4. **Total Current Savings**:
   - Savings from the first job + Savings from the second job = $80 (current savings) + ($200 + $75)
     = $80 + $275
     = $355

5. **Phone Cost**: The phone itself costs $400.

6. **Money Needed to Save**:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on toys.**

- Dean bought 6 toy cars.
  - Cost per toy car = $2
  - Total for toy cars = \( 6 \times 2 = $12 \)

- Dean also bought 5 teddy bears.
  - Cost per teddy bear = $1
  - Total for teddy bears = \( 5 \times 1 = $5 \)

**Step 2: Add the costs together to find the total spent on toys.**

- Total spent on toys = \( $12 + $5 = $17 \)

**Step 3: Subtract the total spent from the initial amount given by his mother.**

- Initial amount given by mother = $28
- Amount spent on toys = $17
- Remaining amount after buying toys = \( $28 - $17 = $11 \)

**Step 4: Account for the additional $10 given by his mother.**

- Additional amount given by mother = $10
- Final remaining amount = \( $11 + $10 = $21 \)

- Number of rounds needed = 2 (since she wants to ride the go-karts twice)
  
\[ \text{Total cost of mini-golf} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of arcade tokens
- Cost per arcade token = $5
- Number of arcade tokens needed = 6 (since there are 3 people + herself)

\[ \text{Total cost of arcade tokens} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Sum up the costs
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 + 30 = 40 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the budget
- Budget = $90
- Total cost = $40

\[ \text{Remaining budget} = 90 - 40 = 50 \]

### Conclusion
Morgan has $50 left after paying for the mini-golf and arcade tokens. Since each friend pays equally towards the cost, we can determine the number of friends she can invite by dividing the remaining budget by the cost per friend:

\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per friend}} \]

Since each friend contributes $5 towards the cost:

\[ \text{Number of friends} = \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

Therefore, Morgan can invite **10 friends**.<|im_end|>","The go karts will cost $20 per person because 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20

To determine how much money Marisa puts into her piggy bank over 5 days, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate daily spending on lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops per day.

   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 4 \times 0.25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

2. **Determine total savings over 5 days:**
   - Since she spends $1 each day, we need to find out what happens after 5 days.

   \[
   \text{Total savings over 5 days} = 1 \text{ dollar/day} \times 5 \text{ days}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total savings over 5 days} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts into her piggy bank over 5 days is \(5\) dollars. The final answer is {The final answer is}: 5 dollars.<|im_end|>","If each lollipop costs 25 cents, 4 lollipops cost 4 * 25 cents = <<4*25=100>>100 cents

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent on candy
Billy buys candy for $1 per pound and has $10 to spend.

Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy buys.
\[ \text{Total cost of candy} = 1.5x \]

Since Billy starts with $10, we can set up an equation to find out how much candy he buys:
\[ 10 - 1.5x = \text{change left after buying candy} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the change left after buying candy
After buying candy, Billy will have the remaining money as change. Let’s denote the change as \( C \).
\[ C = 10 - 1.5x \]

### Step 3: Billy takes half of his change and uses it on gumballs
Billy then takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs at $0.05 each. Since he buys 40 gumballs, he spends:
\[ 0.05 \times 40 = \$2 \]

This means that the change \( C \) must equal $2 (since he took half of his remaining money):
\[ C = 2 \]

### Step 4: Substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation from Step 2
Substitute \( C = 2 \) into the equation from Step 2:
\[ 10 - 1.5x = 2 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \):
\[ 10 - 1.5x = 2 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ 8 = 1.5x \]
Divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{8}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 5.33 \]

So, Billy bought approximately 5.33 pounds of candy.

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{5.33 pounds}}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Carver is currently 45 years old.
   - This age (45) represents ""5 years less than twice the age of his son.""

2. **Define the variable for the son's age:**
   Let \( S \) represent the son's current age.

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship between Carver's age and the son's age:**
   According to the statement, Carver's age (45) equals 5 years less than twice the son's age.
   
   Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   45 = 2S - 5
   \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( S \):**
   To isolate \( S \), first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2S - 5 + 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   50 = 2S
   \]
   
   Next, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = \frac{2S}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying this results in:
   \[
   25 = S
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The son's current age is 25 years.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    A train travels between 3 different cities. ;  It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 ? miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. ,  It does this ? trip 3 times a day.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total distance traveled in one round trip.
- From City 1 to City 2 (first leg): 75 miles
- From City 2 to City 3 (second leg): Let's call this distance \(d_2\)
- From City 3 back to City 1 (third leg): \(d_3 = d_2 - 50\) miles

Since these distances form a complete loop, the sum of these legs must equal the circumference of the circle formed by the trips.

\[ 75 + d_2 + (d_2 - 50) \]

Simplify this equation:

\[ 75 + 2d_2 - 50 = 29 + 2d_2 \]

So, the total distance for one round trip is:

\[ D_{\text{round trip}} = 29 + 2d_2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled over multiple round trips.
The train makes 3 round trips per day, so let’s calculate the total distance covered in one day:

\[ D_{\text{one day}} = 3 \times (29 + 2d_2) \]
\[ D_{\text{one day}} = 87 + 6d_2 \]

### Step 3: Find out how many days the train can travel before needing service.
The train requires maintenance after traveling 18,000 miles. We want to determine how many days it will take to reach this mileage limit.

Let's denote the number of days as \( n \).

Total distance traveled in \( n \) days:

\[ D_{\text{total}} = n \times (87 + 6d_2) \]

We set up an inequality where \( D_{\text{total}} \leq 18,000 \):

\[ n \times (87 + 6d_2) \leq 18,000 \]

Divide both sides by \( 87 + 6d_2 \) to find \( n \):

\[ n \leq \frac{18,000}{87 + 6d_2} \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( d_2 \).
From our earlier calculation of the round trip distance:

\[ 75 + d_2 + (d_2 - 50) = 29 + 2d_2 \]

Simplify:

\[ 75 + d_2 + d_2 - 50 = 29 + 2d_2 \]
\[ 29 + 2d_2 = 29 + 2d_2 \]

This confirms our setup is correct. Now, substitute back into the inequality:

\[ n \leq \frac{18,000}{87 + 6d_2} \]

For simplicity, assume \( d_2 \) is such that \( n \) remains an integer. If we assume typical values or constraints on \( d_2 \), we might get an approximate value for \( n \). 

Given that \( d_2 \) is typically around 50 miles (for practical purposes in real-world scenarios), let's plug this into the inequality:

\[ n \leq \frac{18,000}{87 + 6 \times 50} \]
\[ n \leq \frac{18,000}{87 + 300} \]
\[ n \leq \frac{18,000}{387} \]
\[ n \leq 46.03 \]

Therefore, the train would need service approximately once every 46 days.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{46}

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for one bed that's an average of the first two types.
2. Determine how much stuffing is needed for four chihuahua beds (each needing 2 pounds).
3. Determine how much stuffing is needed for three collie beds (each needing the average amount calculated in step 1).
4. Sum up all the required amounts from steps 2 and 3.

### Step 1: Calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for one bed that's an average of the first two types.
- For a Rottweiler, Mark needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- For a Chihuahua, Mark needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- The average amount of stuffing needed for one bed that’s an average of the first two types is \(\frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5\) pounds.

### Step 2: Determine how much stuffing is needed for four chihuahua beds.
Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing. Therefore, for four chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds.

### Step 3: Determine how much stuffing is needed for three collie beds.
For each collie bed, Mark needs 5 pounds of stuffing. Therefore, for three collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds.

### Step 4: Sum up all the required amounts.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it took for John to travel from his friend's house to his own location (the first part of his journey) and then back on the way home.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Part 1: Traveling to his friend's house
1. **Calculate the distance**: The total distance to his friend's house is 200 miles.
2. **Calculate the time taken**:
   - Speed = 70 mph
   - Distance = 200 miles
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{200}{70} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours}
   \]

#### Part 2: Returning Home
3. **Calculate the distance**: The return trip is 240 miles.
4. **Calculate the time taken**:
   - Speed = 80 mph
   - Distance = 240 miles
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Total Time Calculation
5. **Add up both parts**:
   - Time to go to friend's house: approximately 2.857 hours
   - Time to return home: 3 hours
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2.857 + 3 = 5.857 \text{ hours}

2. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade girls:**
   We're given that 43 girls are present.
   
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 43
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys:**
   Since the total number of students is 96 and we already have 43 girls, the remaining must be boys.
   
   So,
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
   \]

4. **Account for those absent on Friday:**
   It's stated that on Friday, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent.
   
   This means:
   \[
   \text{Total absent students (girls)} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total absent students (boys)} = 4
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday:**
   The total number of boys present should equal the initial number of boys minus the number who were absent.
   
   So,
   \[
   \text{Number of boys present on Friday} = 53 - 4 = 49

                    question:
                    3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart . for refusing to wear masks. A number equals to ; four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times , the number of shoplifters were kicked ! out for physical violence over goods on sale. If a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart, : how many were kicked out for other reasons?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and find out how many people were kicked out for each reason.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of customers who refused to wear masks.
   - Four times that many minus five were kicked out for shoplifting.
   - Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.
   - The total number of people kicked out was 50.

2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - From the first part, we have: \( x = 3 \).
   - From the second part, we have: \( 4x - 5 \).

3. **Substitute the value of \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation from the second part: \( 4(3) - 5 \).

4. **Calculate the value:**
   - Calculate \( 4(3) \): \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \).
   - Subtract 5 from 12: \( 12 - 5 = 7 \).

5. **Find the total number of people kicked out for shoplifting:**
   - The total number of people kicked out for shoplifting is 7.

6. **Determine the number of people kicked out for physical violence:**
   - According to the third part, three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.
   - Therefore, if 7 were kicked out for shoplifting, then \( 3 \times 7 \) were kicked out for physical violence.

7. **Calculate the value:**
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 7 \): \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).

8. **Find the total number of people kicked out for all reasons:**
   - We know the total number of people kicked out was 50.
   - Subtract the number of people kicked out for shoplifting (7) and the number of people kicked out for physical violence (21) from the total.

9. **Calculate the remaining number:**
   - Subtract 7 from 50: \( 50 - 7 = 43 \).
   - Subtract 21 from 43: \( 43 - 21 = 22 \).

Therefore, the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 22. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is} 22.<|im_end|>","First quadruple the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks: 4 * 3 customers = <<4*3=12>>12 customers
Then subtract 5 from this number: 12 customers - 5 customers = 7 customers
Then triple that number to find the number of people kicked out for violence: 7 customers * 3 = <<7*3=21>>21 customers
Then subtract the number of customers kicked out for each known reason to find the number kicked out for other reasons: 50 customers - 3 customers - 21 customers - 7 customers = <<50-3-21-7=19>>19 customers

                    question:
                    After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times ; more points : than Sara, who scored 8. How many points did Erin have before?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of points Erin has after scoring**:
   - Erin scores 14 points.

2. **Calculate how many points Erin has more than Sara**:
   - Sara scores 8 points.
   - Erin has three times as many points as Sara.
   
3. **Set up an equation to find out how many points Erin had initially**:
   Let \( E \) be the initial number of points Erin had.
   According to the information given, Erin's score can be represented as:
   \[
   E + (E - 8) = 14
   \]
   where \( E - 8 \) represents the additional points Erin has over Sara's score.

4. **Simplify the equation**:
   Combine like terms on the left side:
   \[
   2E - 8 = 14
   \]

5. **Solve for \( E \)**:
   Add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \( E \):
   \[
   2E = 22
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   E = 11
   \]

6. **Verify the solution**:
   If Erin originally had 11 points, then she would have scored \( 11 + (11 - 8) = 11 + 3 = 14 \) points in total.

Therefore, Erin had **11 points** before scoring her first 14 points.<|im_end|>","Erin now has three times more points than Sara, which is 3*8= <<3*8=24>>24 more points than Sara.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of seniors
We are given that there are 44 seniors.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the picture frames
Each picture frame costs $20.
There are 44 seniors receiving picture frames.

Total cost for picture frames = Number of seniors × Cost per frame
= 44 × $20
= $880

### Step 3: Calculate the extra cost for etching the logo on the picture frames
The logo etching adds an additional 20% to the base price of the picture frame.

Cost increase due to etching = Base cost × Additional percentage
= $20 × 20%
= $20 × 0.20
= $4

New total cost per picture frame including etching = Base cost + Etch cost
= $20 + $4
= $24

Number of seniors receiving picture frames = 44

Total cost for picture frames after etching = Number of seniors × New total cost per frame
= 44 × $24
= $1,056

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the pins
2 out of the 44 seniors will receive pins, which cost $5 each.

Total cost for pins = Number of seniors receiving pins × Pin cost
= 2 × $5
= $10

### Step 5: Calculate the cost for the cords
1/4 of the seniors (which is 11 seniors) will receive cords, each costing $12.

Total cost for cords = Number of seniors receiving cords × Cord cost
= 11 × $12
= $132

### Step 6: Sum up all the costs
Total cost for picture frames + Total cost for pins + Total cost for cords

Total cost = Picture frame cost + Pin cost + Cord cost
= $1,056 + $10 + $132
= $1,298

### Final Answer
The total amount spent on the senior gifts is $\boxed{1298}$.<|im_end|>","The cost per picture frame is $20 * 1.20 = $<<20*1.20=24>>24.
Total cost for the senior's picture frames is 44 seniors * $24 = $<<44*24=1056>>1056.
The cost for pins will be 2 seniors * $5 = $<<2*5=10>>10.
The number of seniors receiving cords is 1/4 * 44 = <<1/4*44=11>>11 seniors.
The total cost of cords is 11 seniors * $12 = $<<11*12=132>>132.
The total cost of gifts for seniors is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $<<1056+10+132=1198>>1198.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the savings from DIY:**
   - The original price of the wallpaper is $400.
   - A DIY option offers a 20% savings.

   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}\right)
   \]

   Substituting the given values:

   \[
   \text{Savings} = \$400 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) = \$400 \times 0.20 = \$80
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the DIY option:**
   - After applying the discount, the remaining amount would be the cost of making the wallpaper yourself.

   \[
   \text{Cost of DIY Option} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Savings}
   \]

   Substituting the calculated savings:

   \[
   \text{Cost of DIY Option} = \$400 - \$80 = \$320
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper using the DIY option is $\boxed{320}$.<|im_end|>","A DIY will saves 20% after considering the materials cost, meaning you will save 20/100*$400=$<<20/100*400=80>>80 if you make your own hand-painted wallpaper.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of shoes sold over three days. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the sales for each day.
- **Friday**: They sold 14 pairs of shoes.

\[ \text{Sales on Friday} = 14 \]

- **Saturday**: They sold double the number of shoes as on Friday.

\[ \text{Sales on Saturday} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

- **Sunday**: They sold half the number of shoes as on Saturday.

\[ \text{Sales on Sunday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \]

### Step 2: Sum up the sales from all days.
Now, let’s add up the total number of pairs of shoes sold over the three days.

\[ \text{Total Sales} = 14 (\text{Friday}) + 28 (\text{Saturday}) + 14 (\text{Sunday}) \]
\[ \text{Total Sales} = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \]

### Step 3: Adjust for returns.
On Sunday, 6 pairs of shoes were returned due to not fitting well. We subtract these from the total sales.

\[ \text{Final Total} = 56 - 6 = 50 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the final number of pairs of shoes sold by the end of the sale is \( 50 \).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Hallie practiced dancing over the course of one week. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the duration of Saturday's practice.
- We know from the information given that Hallie practices twice as long on Saturdays as she does on Tuesdays.
- She practices for 1 hour on Tuesdays.

Therefore, her practice time on Saturdays is:
\[ \text{Saturday's practice} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday's practice} = 2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate total practice time for each day of the week.
- **Tuesday**: 1 hour
- **Thursday**: 2 hours
- **Saturday**: 2 hours

Now let's add these up to find out how much she practiced in total over the three days.

### Step 3: Summarize the total practice time.
\[ \text{Total practice time} = 1 \text{ hour (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ hours (Saturday)} \]
\[ \text{Total practice time} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours over the course of one week.

   \[
   \text{Value of faulty equipment} = 0.40 \times 400,000 = \$160,000
   \]

2. **Determine the value of the functioning equipment:**
   - Subtract the value of the faulty equipment from the total value.

   \[
   \text{Value of functioning equipment} = 400,000 - 160,000 = \$240,000
   \]

3. **Verify that the company returned the faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Since we're calculating the cost of functioning pieces, the return of the faulty equipment doesn't affect our calculation.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is $\boxed{\$240,000}$.<|im_end|>","If 40% worth of the pieces of equipment bought were faulty and were returned, the amount of money they were bought for is 40/100*$400000 = $<<40/100*400000=160000>>160000

To determine how much milk Mary collects daily, let's break down the process:

1. **Total Sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.

2. **Sheep Distribution**:
   - Half of the sheep (30/2 = 15) will get 1 kg of milk.
   - The other half of the sheep (also 15) will get 2 kg of milk.

3. **Milk Collection per Day**:
   - For the first group of 15 sheep, each getting 1 kg of milk:

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine how many rolls were initially available:**
   Mrs. Sherman made a dozen (12) bread rolls.

2. **Calculate the number of rolls given to her children:**
   She has 6 children, and each child gets one roll.
   \[
   6 \text{ rolls} \times 6 \text{ children} = 36 \text{ rolls}
   \]

3. **Subtract the rolls given to her children from the total initial rolls:**
   \[
   12 \text{ rolls} - 36 \text{ rolls} = -24 \text{ rolls}
   \]
   Since it's not possible to have negative rolls, let's re-evaluate if there was an error in understanding or calculation. Let’s assume there might be another way to approach it.

4. **Assuming no mistake in the first step but considering the distribution differently:**
   If we consider the remainder after giving rolls to children as leftover rolls, then:
   \[
   12 \text{ rolls} - 36 \text{ rolls} = 0 \text{ rolls left over}
   \]
   
5. **Feeding the remaining rolls to chickens:**
   She breaks each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces.
   \[
   0 \text{ rolls} \div 8 \text{ pieces per roll} = 0 \text{ pieces}

3. Determine how many of the remaining pupils like green.
4. Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the total remaining pupils to find out how many like yellow.

Let's go through each step:

### Step 1: Number of pupils who like blue
There are 40 pupils in total. Half of them like blue.

\[ \text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

                    question:
                    Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 ! apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number . of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked ; on Monday, how many apples ? did she pick over the three days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days and then find out how many apples were picked on Monday.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the total revenue from sales:**
   - Lucy's price per apple is $4.
   - She made a total of $56 from selling apples.

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \$56
   \]

   \[
   \text{Price per Apple} = \$4
   \]

   Therefore, the total number of apples sold can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Number of Apples Sold} = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Price per Apple}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Number of Apples Sold} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday.

   Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, on Wednesday she picked:

   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   - Add up the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

   \[
   \text{Total Number of Apples Picked Over Three Days} = \text{Apples on Monday} + \text{Apples on Tuesday} + \text{Apples on Wednesday}
   \]

   Let \( x \) represent the number of apples picked on Monday.

   \[
   \text{Total Number of Apples Picked Over Three Days} = x + 12 + 24
   \]

5. **Find the number of apples picked on Monday:**
   - We know the total number of apples sold is 14. Therefore:

   \[
   x + 12 + 24 = 14
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x + 36 = 14
   \]

   \[
   x = 14 - 36
   \]

   \[
   x = -22
   \]

   This result indicates that there was an error in the calculation or assumptions. Let’s re-evaluate our approach.

### Re-evaluation:

Given that the total number of apples sold should equal 14, let’s reassess:

1. Calculate the total number of apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday combined:
   - Tuesday: 12 apples
   - Wednesday: 24 apples

   Total for Tuesday and Wednesday:

   \[
   12 + 24 = 36
   \]

2. Subtract this sum from the total revenue to find the number of apples sold on Monday:
   
   \[
   \text{Apples sold on Monday} = 14 - 36
   \]

   This results in a negative value, which suggests an inconsistency. Recalculating correctly:

   \[
   \text{Apples sold on Monday} = 14 - (12 + 24)
   \]

   Correctly calculating:

   \[
   \text{Apples sold on Monday} = 14 - 36 = -22
   \]

   This indicates an error. Let’s correct it:

   \[
   \text{Apples sold on Monday} = 14 - 36 = -22
   \]

   Clearly, no apples were actually sold on Monday if the calculations are correct. 

Therefore, the correct number of apples picked on Monday is zero.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","Since each apple costs $4, it means that on Monday, Lucy picked 56/4 = <<56/4=14>>14 apples
Combining Monday and Tuesday, Lucy picked 14 + 12 = <<14+12=26>>26 apples
On Wednesday, she picked 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 apples
All together, Lucy picked 26 + 24 = <<26+24=50>>50 apples.

                    question:
                    Lindsay , is doing the laundry, and thinks she has missed some socks. There are 50 socks that need washing. If she washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks, how many socks has Lindsay missed?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understand the total number of socks
Lindsay needs to wash 50 socks in total.

### Step 2: Determine the number of socks already washed
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks.
- Since one pair consists of 2 socks, 10 pairs would be \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks.

So far, Lindsay has washed **20** socks.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of socks needed to be washed
Subtract the number of socks already washed from the total number of socks needed to be washed:
\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, Lindsay still needs to wash **30** socks.

### Step 4: Determine the number of loose socks washed
Lindsay also washes 15 loose socks.

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of socks Lindsay has washed
Add the number of socks already washed (both paired and loose) together:
\[ 20 \text{ (paired)} + 15 \text{ (loose)} = 35 \]

So, Lindsay has washed **35** socks in total.

### Step 6: Calculate the number of socks Lindsay has missed
Subtract the number of socks already washed from the total number of socks needed to be washed:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Therefore, Lindsay has missed **15** socks.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 15}
\]<|im_end|>","Splitting the pairs shows there were 10 pairs of socks * 2 socks/pair = <<10*2=20>>20 socks paired together.

She has therefore missed 50 socks – 35 socks = <<50-35=15>>15 socks.

   - Rachel buys 23 cookies.
   
2. **Add the cookies Janet gives her:**
   - Janet gives Rachel 42 more cookies.

So, the total number of cookies before any are eaten is:
\[ 23 + 42 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

Therefore, Rachel has 65 cookies in total before any are eaten.

3. **Subtract the cookies that were eaten by Rachel’s brother:**
   - Rachel's brother eats 44 cookies from Rachel's total.

Thus, subtracting the cookies eaten from Rachel's initial count:
\[ 65 - 44 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

Therefore, after her brother eats some cookies, Rachel has:

                    question:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Karan needs to pay per month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total interest on the loan.
Karan's principal (the initial amount borrowed) is $3,650, and the annual interest rate is 10%.

First, calculate the monthly interest rate:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{\text{Annual Interest Rate}}{12} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} \]

Convert the percentage to a decimal:
\[ \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{10}{1200} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Interest Rate} = \frac{1}{120} \]

Now, calculate the total interest over the five-month period:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly Interest Rate} \times \text{Number of Months} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times \left(\frac{1}{120}\right) \times 5 \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{5}{120} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \times \frac{1}{24} \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 3650 \div 24 \]
\[ \text{Total Interest} = 152.0833... \]

So, the total interest over five months is approximately $152.08.

### Step 2: Determine the total amount paid back including the interest.
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Back} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Back} = 3650 + 152.08 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Paid Back} = 3802.08 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment.
To find out how much Karan needs to pay per month, divide the total amount paid back by the number of months.
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Paid Back}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416 \]

Therefore, Karan needs to pay approximately **$760.42** per month to repay her loan over five months.<|im_end|>","Karan's interest is $3,650 × 0.1 = $<<3650*0.1=365>>365.
In total Karan has to pay $3650 + $365 = $<<3650+365=4015>>4015.
Every month she has to pay $4015 / 5 = $<<4015/5=803>>803.

                    Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours. How many kilometers farther did , Cho hike?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Cho hiked**

Given:
- Speed (distance per unit time) = 14 km/h
- Time spent hiking = 8 hours

Distance can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked a total distance of **112 kilometers**.

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Chloe hiked**

Given:
- Speed (distance per unit time) = 9 km/h
- Time spent hiking = 5 hours

Again, use the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]

Perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

So, Chloe hiked a total distance of **45 kilometers**.

**Step 3: Determine how much farther Cho hiked**

To find out how much farther Cho hiked than Chloe, subtract Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{Cho} - \text{Distance}_\text{Chloe} \]

Substitute the known distances:

\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} \]

Perform the subtraction:

\[ \text{Difference in Distance} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, **Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe**.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many silver pesos Anna has:**
   - Axel has 50 silver pesos.
   - Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel.

\[
\text{Anna's silver pesos} = 2 \times \text{Axel's silver pesos}
\]

\[
\text{Anna's silver pesos} = 2 \times 50 = 100

2. **Calculate the total number of silver pesos between Axel and Anna:**

\[
\text{Total silver pesos} = \text{Axel's silver pesos} + \text{Anna's silver pesos}
\]

\[
\text{Total silver pesos} = 50 + 100 = 150
\]

3. **Determine how many gold pesos Anna has:**
   - Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel.

\[
\text{Anna's gold pesos} = \text{Axel's gold pesos} + 40
\]

Since Axel does not have any gold pesos mentioned:

\[
\text{Anna's gold pesos} = 40

                    Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. She spends $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine Millie's profit from selling lemonade, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue
First, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.

- Number of cups in one pitcher = 12
- Number of pitchers made = 3
- Therefore, total number of cups sold = \(3 \times 12 = 36\)

- Selling price per cup = $1
- Total revenue (if all cups were sold) = \(36 \times 1 = \$36\)

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost
Next, we'll calculate the total cost of the supplies.

- Cost to buy supplies = $18

### Step 3: Calculate Profit Before Expenses
Profit before expenses = Total revenue - Total cost
= \(36 - 18 = \$18\)

### Step 4: Calculate Profit After Expenses
Now, we subtract the cost of running the lemonade stand from the profit before expenses.
- Hourly expense to run the stand = Not explicitly provided but assumed as $X per hour

Let's denote the hourly expense as $Y$.

Profit after expenses = Profit before expenses - Hourly expense
= \(18 - Y\)

### Conclusion
Given that the problem asks about ""the"" profit per hour, it implies that there are no other costs or expenses mentioned besides what was spent on supplies. Thus, if only the supply cost is considered, the profit after expenses would be $18 minus any additional hourly costs.

However, since the problem doesn't specify the exact amount of the hourly cost, I've concluded based on the given information:

{The final answer is} \(18 - Y\) where \(Y\) is the hourly expense. If you provide the actual hourly cost, then the calculation would yield a specific dollar value for the profit per hour. Without the hourly cost, the expression remains as \(18 - Y\).<|im_end|>","She has enough supplies to make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hectares of land Mr. Ruther originally owned based on the information provided.

Step 1: Determine what fraction of his land was sold.
Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of land that remains after selling.
We know that 12.8 hectares represent the remaining part of his land.

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total original land area.
Let \(x\) be the total original land area in hectares.

According to the problem, \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land (since \(\frac{3}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{5}\)) corresponds to 12.8 hectares.

Therefore, \(\frac{2}{5} x = 12.8\).

Step 4: Solve for \(x\).
\[ x = \frac{12.8 \times 5}{2} \]

Step 5: Perform the calculation.
\[ x = \frac{64}{2} \]
\[ x = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many people sang in the performance, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boys and girls in the choir:**
   - Total members = 52
   - Boys (50%) = \( \frac{52}{2} = 26 \)
   - Girls (50%) = \( \frac{52}{2} = 26 \)

2. **Determine who will be performing at the show:**
   - Since only females are allowed to perform, all 26 girls will participate.

3. **Account for those unable to go due to transportation issues:**
   - Half of the girls cannot attend.
   - Number of girls unable to attend = \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \)

4. **Include the choir’s 3 teachers as additional participants:**

Now let's sum up the total number of people involved in the performance:
- Girls participating = 26
- Teachers joining = 3

Total people singing in the performance = \( 26 + 3 = 29 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]<|im_end|>","The 50 person choir is 50% female, so if the performance is just women there will be 52/2=26 people performing.
If half of those people can't make it to the performance, then there will be 26/2= <<26/2=13>>13 people performing.
When the 3 teachers decide to participate, the performance now has 13+3=<<13+3=16>>16 people singing.

<|im_start|>system
To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the sum of all five test scores.
- Test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, 74
- Sum = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74

Let's add them up:

\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 230 \]
\[ 230 + 86 = 316 \]
\[ 316 + 74 = 390 \]

So, the total sum of the test scores is 390.

Step 2: Divide the total sum by the number of test scores (which is 5) to find the average.
- Average = Total sum / Number of scores
- Average = 390 / 5

Now let's divide:

\[ 390 ÷ 5 = 78 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 78.

Final Answer: The final answer is 78.<|im_end|>","He received 65, 94, 81, 86 and a 74 on his 5 math tests so that's 65+94+81+86+74 = <<400=400>>400

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu first and then add it to the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.

Step 1: Determine the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.
- We know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
- He also delivers \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many messages to Mr. Yu.
- Let \(x\) represent the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu.

From the given information, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 \]

Step 2: Calculate the value of \(x\).
\[ x = \frac{66}{3} \]
\[ x = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of messages delivered.
- Messages to Ms. Thompson: 66
- Messages to Mr. Yu: 22

Total messages delivered:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

                    question:
                    David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are ? 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money David saves compared to Dasha, we need to calculate the total cost for both scenarios and then find the difference.

### Scenario 1: David uses a ride bracelet
- Cost of a ride bracelet: $30
- Number of rides given by the ride bracelet: 9
- Since they ride all 9 rides, the number of additional rides needed (if any) is 0.
  
Therefore, the total cost for David in this scenario is simply the cost of the ride bracelet:
\[ \text{Total cost for David} = \$30 \]

### Scenario 2: David buys tickets
- Cost per ride ticket: $2
- Total number of ride tickets needed: 9
- Cost for 9 ride tickets:
\[ \text{Cost for 9 ride tickets} = 9 \times \$2 = \$18 \]

### Calculate the savings
David's savings will be the difference between his total costs from the two scenarios:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost for David using the ride bracelet} - \text{Total cost for David buying tickets}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Savings} = \$30 - \$18 = \$12 \]

Thus, David saves **$12** by choosing to use the ride bracelet instead of buying individual ride tickets.<|im_end|>","Each ride cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles both Betty and Sam have individually and then find out how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty.

Step 1: Define the variables.
Let \( B \) be the number of popsicles Betty has.
Let \( S \) be the number of popsicles Sam has.

Step 2: Set up the equation based on the given ratio and total number of popsicles.
According to the problem, the ratio of popsicles between Betty and Sam is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. Therefore, if we let \( k \) be the common multiplier, then:
\[ B = 5k \]
\[ S = 6k \]

Step 3: Use the total number of popsicles to set up another equation.
The total number of popsicles is given as 165. So,
\[ B + S = 165 \]
Substitute \( B \) and \( S \) from Step 2 into this equation:
\[ 5k + 6k = 165 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 11k = 165 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( k \).
Divide both sides by 11:
\[ k = \frac{165}{11} \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Step 5: Calculate the number of popsicles each person has.
Now that we know \( k = 15 \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
\[ B = 5k = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
\[ S = 6k = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

Step 6: Determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.
Sam has 90 popsicles, and Betty has 75 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]<|im_end|>","The total ratio representing the number of popsicles that Betty and sam have is 5+6 = <<5+6=11>>11.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Tim saves by switching to streaming services, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost of the cable package.
- Cable costs: $60 per month.

### Step 2: Determine the savings from cancelling the cable package.
- Tim's new monthly cost after cancellation will be reduced due to the savings on his current cable plan.
- Current cable costs: $60 per month.
- Savings percentage: 20%.

First, calculate the savings amount based on the original cable cost:
\[ \text{Savings} = \text{Original Cost} \times \left(\frac{\text{Savings Percentage}}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$60 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$60 \times 0.20 \]
\[ \text{Savings} = \$12 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the net monthly savings by subtracting the new cost from the previous cable cost.
- New monthly cost after switching to streaming services:
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = \text{Cable Package Cost} - \text{Savings} \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = \$60 - \$12 \]
\[ \text{New Monthly Cost} = \$48 \]

### Conclusion:
By cancelling his cable subscription, Tim saves a total of **$12** per month. This calculation shows that Tim saves $12 in monthly fees by opting out of his cable service and choosing streaming options instead.<|im_end|>","Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost 10+10=$<<10+10=20>>20

To determine what percentage of her total work time Carol spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on all activities:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of the writing time, so \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes, which is \( \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \) hours

   Adding these together gives us the total time:
   \[
   4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time spent editing as a fraction of the total time:**
   - The time spent editing is 1.5 hours.
   - The total time is 7.5 hours.

3. **Convert the time spent editing into a decimal for easier calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
   \]

4. **Convert this decimal back into a percentage:**

- Calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) slices.

So, **Bill receives 4 slices**.

**Step 2: Determine how many slices Jenny gives to Mark**
- Jenny gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the slices to Mark.
- Calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) slices.

So, **Mark receives 3 slices**.

**Step 3: Subtract the slices given to Bill from the total slices**
- Total slices given to Bill: 4 slices.
- Remaining slices after giving to Bill: 
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the slices given to Mark from the remaining slices**
- Slices left after giving to Bill: 8 slices.
- Remaining slices after giving to Mark: 
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

**Step 5: Account for the slices Jenny eats herself**
- Jenny eats 2 slices.
- Subtract these slices from the remaining slices:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of millipedes.
Nancy saw \(\frac{1}{3}\) as many millipedes as spiders. Since there were 90 spiders:

\[
\text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
\]

So, there are 30 millipedes.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of stink bugs.
The number of stink bugs is given as twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[
\text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
\]

So, there are 48 stink bugs.

### Step 3: Sum up all the bugs.
Now, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 (\text{spiders}) + 30 (\text{millipedes}) + 48 (\text{stink bugs})
\]

\[
\text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 178

   - We know that Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
   - Erica is 30 years old.

2. Calculate Beth's age:
   - If Erica is 30 years old, then Beth is \(30 + 5 = 35\) years old.

3. Now, let's find out how much older Alice is compared to Beth.
   - Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
   - So, Alice's age is \(35 + 7 = 42\) years old.

4. Finally, calculate the difference in their ages:
   - The difference between Alice and Erica is \(42 - 30 = 12\).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount earned over the course of one year. Let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of workdays per month.
- The builder works for 4 weeks every month.
- There are 7 days in a week.

First, let's find out how many days the builder works in one month:
\[ \text{Days worked per month} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

Next, we'll determine how many workdays he has each week:
\[ \text{Workdays per week} = 6 \]
So, the number of workdays per month is:
\[ \text{Workdays per month} = 28 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of workdays in a year.
There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ \text{Total workdays in a year} = 28 \times 12 \]

Let's compute that:
\[ \text{Total workdays in a year} = 336 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings based on daily pay.
The builder earns $50 per day. Therefore, his total earnings for the year can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 336 \times 50 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 16800 \]

Therefore, the builder would earn **$16,800** if he works for a year at the given conditions.<|im_end|>","The builder works for 6 days every week and works for 4 weeks every month so he works for 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = <<6*4=24>>24 days/month

                    question:
                    Mark is making a quadruple ! batch of brownies. The normal ! recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and , 1 cup milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk ? is sold in 2-cup bottles, how : many more bags of flour than bottles of milk does Mark have to buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more bags of flour Mark has to buy compared to bottles of milk, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour needed.
- The original recipe calls for 3 cups of flour per batch.
- Mark is making a quadruple ! batch, so he needs four times that amount.

\[
\text{Total flour needed} = 4 \times 3 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many bags of flour Mark needs.
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.
- To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total amount of flour required by the bag size.

\[
\text{Number of bags of flour} = \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bottles of milk needed.
- The original recipe calls for 1 cup of milk per batch.
- Again, since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he needs four times that amount.

\[
\text{Total milk needed} = 4 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 4 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many bottles of milk Mark needs.
- Milk is also sold in 2-cup bottles.
- To find out how many bottles are needed, divide the total amount of milk required by the bottle size.

\[
\text{Number of bottles of milk} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Step 5: Compare the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk.
- Mark needs 6 bags of flour.
- Mark needs 2 bottles of milk.

\[
\text{Difference} = 6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \text{ more bags of flour}
\]

### Final Answer:
Mark has to buy **4** more bags of flour than bottles of milk.<|im_end|>","To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 3 cups * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cups of flour.

To make 4 brownies, Mark needs: 1 cup * 4 = <<1*4=4>>4 cups of milk
To get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy: 4 cups / 2 cups/bottle = <<4/2=2>>2 bottles of milk
Finally, subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour to find the difference: 6 - 2 = <<6-2=4>>4

<|im_start|>user

To determine how much electricity Mel saves, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of energy used per day.
2. Determine the new usage after reducing the hours spent using the AC.
3. Find the difference between the original daily usage and the reduced daily usage.
4. Multiply this difference by the number of days (30) to get the total saved energy.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of energy used per day

Mel uses the AC for 8 hours a day at 900 watts per hour.

\[ \text{Total energy per day} = 8 \times 900 \text{ watt-hours} \]

\[ \text{Total energy per day} = 7200 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (since \(1 \text{ kWh} = 1000 \text{ Wh}\)):

\[ \text{Total energy per day} = \frac{7200}{1000} \text{ kWh} \]

\[ \text{Total energy per day} = 7.2 \text{ kWh} \]

### Step 2: Determine the new usage after reducing the hours spent using the AC

If Mel reduces his use by 5 hours a day, he will only use the AC for:

\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \text{ hours/day} \]

### Step 3: Find the difference between the original daily usage and the reduced daily usage

Original daily usage: \(7.2 \text{ kWh}\)

Reduced daily usage: \(3 \text{ hours/day} \times 900 \text{ watts/hour}\)

\[ \text{Reduced daily usage} = 3 \times 900 \text{ watt-hours} \]

\[ \text{Reduced daily usage} = 2700 \text{ watt-hours} \]

Now, calculate the difference:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Original daily usage} - \text{Reduced daily usage} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 7.2 \text{ kWh} - 2.7 \text{ kWh} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = 4.5 \text{ kWh} \]

### Step 4: Multiply this difference by the number of days (30) to get the total saved energy

\[ \text{Total saved energy} = 4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} \]

\[ \text{Total saved energy} = 135 \text{ kWh} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

So, Mel saves 7200 - 4500 = <<7200-4500=2700>>2700 watts per day.
That is 2700/1000 = <<2700/1000=2.7>>2.7 kilowatts per day since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the average number of stripes for the zebras, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes**

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- Another zebra with half as many stripes as the one with 36 stripes.

Let's calculate the stripes for the last two zebras first:

\[ \text{Number of stripes on the second zebra} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Now add up all the stripes together:

\[ \text{Total stripes} = (17 + 17) + 36 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Total stripes} = 34 + 36 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Total stripes} = 70 + 18 \]
\[ \text{Total stripes} = 88 \]

So far, we've calculated the total number of stripes across all three zebras.

**Step 2: Find the average number of stripes**

To find the average number of stripes per zebra, divide the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:

\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} \]
\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = \frac{88}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average stripes per zebra} = 29.\overline{3} \]

Therefore, the average number of stripes for the zebras is **29.333...** or approximately **29.33** when rounded to two decimal places.<|im_end|>","First find the number of stripes the last zebra has: 36 stripes / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 stripes

                    Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required ! 1 pound each . of : meat ! and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to , make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of sandwiches needed.
Tyson wants to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we can calculate the number of sandwiches required as follows:
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{People served per sandwich}} \]
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20}{4} \]
\[ \text{Number of sandwiches} = 5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat needed.
Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, the amount of meat needed is:
\[ \text{Amount of meat needed} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Meat per sandwich} \]
\[ \text{Amount of meat needed} = 5 \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Amount of meat needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the meat.
The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. So, the total cost of the meat is:
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = \text{Amount of meat needed} \times \text{Cost per pound of meat} \]
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Cost of meat} = \$35.00 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of cheese needed.
Since there are no specific details about the quantity of cheese required per sandwich or overall, we will assume that the same proportion of cheese is used as meat for simplicity (though typically different proportions might be used). This means that if 5 sandwiches require 5 pounds of meat, then approximately the same quantity of cheese would also be used.

However, without specifying the exact ratio, we cannot accurately determine the amount of cheese needed unless additional information about how much cheese is consumed per sandwich is provided.

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of the cheese.
If we assume the same proportion of cheese as meat, and since the cost of cheese is not specified in the problem, we cannot determine its exact cost.

### Conclusion:
- **Cost of Meat**: $35.00
- **Cost of Cheese**: Not determined due to lack of information regarding the consumption rate of cheese per sandwich.

Therefore, based solely on the given data, Tyson would spend $35.00 on meat to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people. Without knowing the amount of cheese needed, we cannot provide an accurate estimate for the cheese cost.<|im_end|>","Each sandwich serves 4 people and he had 20 people in total to make food for so 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches

                    question:
                    At Allan's house, there . is twice as much corn as cannolis. He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house. Allan bought 60 more cannolis at the store and 40 fewer corns than the number of ! cannolis. Find the combined total of the number of corns and , cannolis Allan has in the house?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Determine the initial number of corns**:
   - We know that Allan has twice as many corns as cannolis.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cannolis.
   - Given: \( C = 40 \).
   - Therefore, the number of corns, \( C_{corn} \), is:
     \[
     C_{corn} = 2 \times C = 2 \times 40 = 80
     \]

2. **Calculate the additional corns bought**:
   - Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   - Since he also buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, we need to find out how many more corns he buys.
   - Number of cannolis bought: \( 60 \).
   - Corns per cannoli: \( 80 \) (since he initially had 80 corns).
   - Corns bought = \( 60 \) cannolies * \( 40 \) corns/cannoli = \( 2400 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of corns after buying more**:
   - Initial number of corns + Additional corns bought:
     \[
     Total\ corns = C_{corn} + 2400 = 80 + 2400 = 2480
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cannolis**:
   - Initial cannolis + Cannolis bought:
     \[
     Total\ cannolis = C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100
     \]

5. **Combine the total number of corns and cannolis**:
   - Add the total number of corns and cannolis together:
     \[
     Combined\ total = Total\ corns + Total\ cannolis = 2480 + 100 = 2580
     \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{2580}\).<|im_end|>","Before buying any corn and cannoli, Allan had twice as much corn as cannoli, which is 40 cannoli * 2 corn/cannoli = <<40*2=80>>80 corns
The total number of corns and cannolis that Allan had before is 80 corn + 40 corn = <<80+40=120>>120 corn
When he bought 40 fewer corns than cannolis, he bought 60 corn - 40 corn = <<60-40=20>>20 corns
In total, he bought 20 corns + 60 cannolis = <<20+60=80>>80 items
After the purchases, Allan has 120 items + 80 items = <<120+80=200>>200 total corns and cannolis combined.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into clear steps:

1. **Determine total steps needed**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps per day.
   
2. **Calculate completed steps before the jog**:
   - Elliott has already walked half of his target distance to and from school. Half of 10,000 steps is 5,000 steps.
   - Additionally, he walked an extra 1,000 steps on his way to and from school.
   - Therefore, before starting the jog, he has completed \(5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000\) steps.

3. **Account for remaining steps after the jog**:
   - After the jog, he still needs 2,000 more steps to reach his goal of 10,000 steps.
   - This means that before the jog, he had \(10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000\) steps in total.

4. **Find out how many steps Elliott took during the jog**:
   - Since he started with 6,000 steps before the jog, and now he has 8,000 steps in total, we can calculate the number of steps he took during the jog as follows:
     \[
     \text{Steps taken during the jog} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000
     \]

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.

{The final answer is}. 2,000 steps.<|im_end|>","Elliott took half of his steps on his school journey, which was 10,000 steps / 2 = <<10000/2=5000>>5,000 steps.
Adding this to his short walk means he has taken 5,000 + 1,000 = <<6000=6000>>6,000 steps.
He only has 2,000 steps left, which means that during the day, he has taken 10,000 goal steps – 2,000 remaining steps = <<10000-2000=8000>>8,000 steps.
The difference between these is therefore the steps he took during his jog, which was 8,000 total steps – 6,000 steps on his school walks and short walks = <<8000-6000=2000>>2,000 steps.

                    question:
                    Toby is reading a book that is 45 pages , long. It averages 200 words a page. Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 , minutes to get : to the airport. How many minutes early ? will Toby be?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of words in the book.
Given:
- The book is 45 pages long.
- Each page contains an average of 200 words.

Total words = Number of pages × Average words per page
\[ \text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total words} = 9000 \]

### Step 2: Determine the time it takes for Toby to read the entire book.
Given:
- Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute.

Time to read the book (in minutes) = Total words / Words per minute
\[ \text{Reading time} = \frac{9000}{300} \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Reading time} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time required including travel time.
Toby needs to travel to the airport, which takes 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time required is:
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Reading time} + \text{Travel time} \]
\[ \text{Total time} = 30 + 10 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Determine if Toby will arrive on time or earlier than planned.
Toby plans to leave when he finishes reading, but the total time required is 40 minutes. Since his flight departs in 60 minutes, we compare the two times:
- Departure time: 40 minutes from now.
- Flight duration: 60 minutes.

Since 40 < 60, Toby will not have enough time to finish reading before the plane leaves. 

Therefore, Toby will not arrive on time and will be late.

### Final Answer:
Toby will be late by \(40 - 60 = 20\) minutes. 

\[
\boxed{\text{20 minutes}}
\]<|im_end|>","He can read 1.5 pages in a minute because 300 / 200 = <<300/200=1.5>>1.5

He will arrive at the airport 40 minutes from now because 30 + 10 = <<30+10=40>>40
He will be 20 minutes early because 60 - 40 = <<60-40=20>>20

                    Carolyn works : for a ; delivery service company that hires . on a contract basis. In May, they hired 40 employees, paying : each employee $15 per . hour for a 40-hour workweek. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to its employees over May and June, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly payroll for May**
- Number of employees hired in May = 40
- Hourly wage rate = $15
- Hours worked per week = 40
- Weeks in May = 4 (assuming May has exactly 4 weeks)

Total earnings for May = 
\[ \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hourly wage rate} \times \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Weeks in May} \]
\[ = 40 \times 15 \times 40 \times 4 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 40 \times 15 = 600 \]
\[ 600 \times 40 = 24,000 \]
\[ 24,000 \times 4 = 96,000 \]

So, the total payroll for May is **$96,000**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who left after June**

Since 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired in June, we can find out how many employees left:
\[ \text{Number of employees who left} = \frac{\text{Total number of employees}}{4} \]
\[ = \frac{40}{4} \]
\[ = 10 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of employees after June**

After some employees leave, the number of remaining employees becomes:
\[ \text{Remaining employees} = \text{Total number of employees} - \text{Employees who left} \]
\[ = 40 - 10 \]
\[ = 30 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the payroll for June**
- Remaining employees = 30
- Hourly wage rate = $15
- Hours worked per week = 40
- Weeks in June = 4

Total earnings for June = 
\[ \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Hourly wage rate} \times \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Weeks in June} \]
\[ = 30 \times 15 \times 40 \times 4 \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 30 \times 15 = 450 \]
\[ 450 \times 40 = 18,000 \]
\[ 18,000 \times 4 = 72,000 \]

So, the total payroll for June is **$72,000**.

**Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees over May and June**

Total amount paid = Payroll for May + Payroll for June
\[ = 96,000 + 72,000 \]
\[ = 168,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to its employees in May and June is **$168,000**.<|im_end|>","When hired, each employee is paid $15*40 = $<<15*40=600>>600 per week.
The total earnings of a contracted employee in a month are 4 weeks * $600 per week = $<<4*600=2400>>2400
Paying 40 employees, the company paid 40*$2400= $<<40*2400=96000>>96000 to all of its contract employees in May.
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, that is 1/4*40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 employees.
The total number of employees whose contracts were valid in June was 40-10 = <<40-10=30>>30 employees.
The total amount of money paid to the contracted employees in June is 30*$2400 = $<<30*2400=72000>>72000

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of taffy
- The original price of one pound of taffy is $3.
- Sally buys 2 pounds, so we need to calculate the total cost for 2 pounds.

\[
\text{Total cost for taffy} = 2 \times (3 - 0.5) = 2 \times 2.5 = \$5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells
- The price of the mixed bag is $1.50.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the magnets
- Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.

\[
\text{Total cost for magnets} = 4 \times 0.25 = \$1
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all expenses
- Taffy: $5
- Mixed bag of seashells: $1.50
- Magnets: $1

\[
\text{Total expenses} = \$5 + \$1.50 + \$1 = \$7.50
\]

### Step 5: Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount given
- Sally initially had $10.

\[
\text{Money left} = \$10 - \$7.50 = \$2.50
\]

### Final Answer
The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$2.50}
\]<|im_end|>","Taffy is buying 1 pound for $3 and gets 1 pound half off. So 1/2 off of 1 pound is $3/2 = $1.50+$3.00=$4.50

Tim bought two packs of fireworks.
- The first pack costs $400.
- The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack.

\[ \text{Cost of second pack} = 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

**Step 2: Add the cost of the finale fireworks**

The finale fireworks cost $150.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost before any discounts**

Add the cost of both packs and the finale fireworks together.

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = \$400 + \$800 + \$150 \]

\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = \$1350 \]

**Step 4: Apply the 20% discount**

A 20% discount means Tim pays 80% of the original price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).

\[ \text{Discounted total} = 0.80 \times \$1350 \]

\[ \text{Discounted total} = \$1080 \]

**Final Answer:**

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs to bake, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies needed:**
   - Shannon plans to eat 2 cookies per day.
   - She wants this to last for 30 days.

\[
\text{Total cookies needed} = \text{Cookies per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

2. **Determine the amount of cookies that can be stored in the freezer:**
   - Shannon's recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies at a time.

\[
\text{Cookies per batch} = 12
\]

3. **Find out how many batches are required to meet the total cookie requirement:**

\[
\text{Batches needed} = \frac{\text{Total cookies needed}}{\text{Cookies per batch}} = \frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ batches}
\]

4. **Convert the number of batches into dozens:**

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, we convert batches to dozens:

\[
\text{Dozens needed} = \frac{\text{Batches needed}}{12} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

Now, let’s express this in whole numbers. Since partial batches aren't practical, Shannon should round up to ensure she doesn’t run out of cookies before her 30-day period ends. Therefore, she needs one more batch than calculated above.

5. **Finalize the calculation:**

Shannon needs to make an additional batch because \( \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167 \) which rounds up to 1 full batch plus an extra cookie from another batch if necessary.

Thus, the final number of dozens of cookies she needs to bake is:

\[
\boxed{1.8333}
\] 

However, since she cannot bake a fraction of a batch, she would need to bake 2 batches to ensure she has enough cookies for 30 days. This way, she will have exactly 2 dozen cookies, which covers all her daily consumption over the 30 days.<|im_end|>","She eats 2 cookies a night so for 30 nights she needs 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 cookies

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many candles will both smell like wet dog and explode, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of candles that are both more dangerous (smell like wet dog) and likely to explode.
2. Determine what percentage of those candles will be defective.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of candles that are both more dangerous and likely to explode:**
   - We know that 5% of all candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   - Out of those, only 5% of the total will actually explode.
   
   Let's denote the total number of candles made as \( N \). Here, \( N = 50000 \).

   Therefore, the number of candles that smell like wet dog but do not explode is:
   \[
   \text{Number of defected candles} = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500
   \]

2. **Determine which of these candles will actually explode:**
   - Only 5% of the defected candles will explode.
   
   So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
   \[
   \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.05 \times 2500 = 125
   \]

### Conclusion:
There will be 125 candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}
\]<|im_end|>","First find what percentage of the candles explode: 100% - 99% = 1%

Then multiply that percentage by the number of candles to find the number of them that have both defects: 0.05% * 50000 candles = <<0.05*.01*50000=25>>25 candles

                    Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular , price for each blouse is $20. ;  How much is the . total cost of the discounted blouses?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many discounts apply.
2. Calculate the total discount amount.
3. Subtract the total discount from the original price.

Step 1: Determine how many discounts apply.
Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack. Since she picked out all the available blouses, there are no additional discounts applied beyond the 30%.

Step 2: Calculate the total discount amount.
A 30% discount on one blouse means that she saves 30% of the regular price ($20) per blouse.

First, calculate the discount for one blouse:
\[ \text{Discount per blouse} = 0.30 \times 20 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 0.30 \times 20 = 6 \]

So, the discount per blouse is $6.

Since she bought 4 blouses, the total discount is:
\[ \text{Total discount} = 4 \times 6 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \]

Step 3: Subtract the total discount from the original price.
The original price for one blouse is $20, so the total original price for 4 blouses is:
\[ \text{Total original price} = 4 \times 20 \]

Perform the multiplication:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Now, subtract the total discount from the total original price:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 80 - 24 \]

Perform the subtraction:
\[ 80 - 24 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]<|im_end|>","Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.
Total discount on the blouses is $80 x 30% = $<<80*30*.01=24>>24.
Misha paid $80 - $24 = $<<80-24=56>>56 for the discounted blouses.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts:

1. **Determine the number of apples gathered from the average trees:**

   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees.
   
2. **Calculate the number of apples gathered from the shortest trees:**

   - Since Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees compared to the tallest trees, she gathers \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) apples from the shortest trees.

3. **Express the total number of apples gathered by both sisters in terms of \( x \):**

   - The total number of apples gathered by Joanne is \( 30 + x \).
   - The total number of apples gathered by her sister is \( 30 + 15 + (3x) \).

4. **Set up an equation based on the given information that their total is 500 apples:**

   \[
   30 + x + 30 + 15 + (3x) = 500
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( x \):**

   \[
   75 + 4x = 500
   \]
   Subtract 75 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 425
   \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{425}{4} = 106.25
   \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 106.25 apples from the average trees.<|im_end|>","Joanna gathered 30 apples / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 apples from the shortest trees.
Her sister gathered 30 apples * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 apples from the tallest trees.

In total, her sister gathered 60 + 45 = <<60+45=105>>105 apples.
From the tallest and shortest trees, Joanna gathered 30 + 15 = <<30+15=45>>45 apples.
So far, the sisters have a combined total of 105 + 45 = <<105+45=150>>150 apples.
Therefore, Joanna must have gathered 500 total apples – 150 apples so far = <<500-150=350>>350 apples from the average trees.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dromedaries are in the herd based on the given information about the number of heads and bumps.

Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( c \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dromedaries.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Given Information
We know that:
- Each camel has 1 head (since they are camels).
- Each dromedary also has 1 head (since they are dromedaries).

So, the total number of heads can be represented as:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

Next, let's consider the bumps:
- Each camel has 2 humps.
- Each dromedary has 1 hump.

Thus, the total number of bumps can be represented as:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations
Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

First, subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Substitute \( c = 124 \) back into equation 1:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, there are **56** dromedaries in the herd.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{56}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.

To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we need to break down the journey into its components and sum up the distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers per day for 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 200 \, \text{kilometers/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 800 \, \text{kilometers}
   \]

2. **Determine the distance traveled in the last two days:**
   - The remaining distance was 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Distance} = 0.30 \times 800 \, \text{kilometers} = 240 \, \text{kilometers}
   \]

3. **Sum the distances from the first and last two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance for First Two Weeks} = 800 \, \text{kilometers} + 240 \, \text{kilometers} = 1040 \, \text{kilometers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled in the third week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers per day for 7 days.
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 300 \, \text{kilometers/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 2100 \, \text{kilometers}

5. **Sum the distances for both weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 1040 \, \text{kilometers (first two weeks)} + 2100 \, \text{kilometers (third week)} = 3140 \, \text{kilometers}

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the size of Zack's locker
We know that Peter’s locker is \(\frac{1}{4}\) as big as Zack’s locker. Given that Peter’s locker is 5 cubic inches, we can set up the equation:
\[ \text{Peter's locker size} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]
Substituting the given value for Peter’s locker size:
\[ 5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]

### Step 2: Solve for Zack's locker size
To find the size of Zack’s locker, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[ 5 \times 4 = \text{Zack's locker size} \]
\[ 20 = \text{Zack's locker size} \]

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

### Step 3: Determine the size of Timothy's locker
We know that Zack’s locker is half as big as Timothy’s locker. Therefore, if Zack’s locker is 20 cubic inches, then Timothy’s locker must be twice as large:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 2 \times \text{Zack's locker size} \]
Substituting the size of Zack’s locker:
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Timothy's locker size} = 40 \]

Therefore, Timothy’s locker is 40 cubic inches.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the difference in elevation between Stanley and Oliver.
Stanley is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, while Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

\[ \text{Elevation Difference} = 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate how much higher Stanley's comb needs to be compared to Oliver's current position.
Oliver has already reached a height of 3,000 feet. The comb fell from Stanley's pocket, which was at an elevation of 10,000 feet.

\[ \text{Height of Comb} = 10,000 \]
\[ \text{Height Oliver is at} = 3,000 \]
\[ \text{Required Height for Comb} = 10,000 - 3,000 = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Since we've determined that the comb needs to be 7,000 feet above Oliver's current location, and Oliver is only at 3,000 feet, the remaining distance Oliver needs to climb is:

\[ \text{Distance Oliver Needs to Climb} = 7,000 \]

### Conclusion:
Oliver must climb **7,000** feet to reach the elevation where Stanley's comb can now be found.

2. **Sum the amounts from both banks:**
   - Amount from first bank: $4000
   - Amount from second bank: $8000

   \[
   \text{Total amount received} = \$4000 + \$8000 = \$12000

3. **Add this total to his initial capital:**
   - Initial capital: $5000

   \[

To solve this problem, we need to break down the costs into different periods and sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 6 months
- The initial rate for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
- Total cost for the first 6 months = $8/month * 6 months = $48

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8)
- The normal rate after the introductory period is $12 per month.
- Cost for months 7 and 8 at the normal rate = $12/month * 2 months = $24

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the last 2 months (months 9 and 10)
- After 8 months, the service increases to $14 per month.
- Cost for months 9 and 10 at the increased rate = $14/month * 2 months = $28

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs
Total cost over 10 months = Cost for the first 6 months + Cost for months 7 and 8 + Cost for months 9 and 10

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original price of the jogger jeans:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - According to the problem, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
     Therefore, \( x = 28 - 6 \).

2. **Calculate the amount saved on the jogger jeans:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 from buying both pairs.
   - Since he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, let's denote his savings as \( S_j \).
     Hence, \( S_j = \frac{1}{3}S_{joggers} \), where \( S_{joggers} \) is the total savings from the jogger jeans.

3. **Calculate the total savings from the tattered jeans:**
   - Cole also saved a total of $6 from the tattered jeans.
   - His savings can be expressed as \( S_t \).

4. **Express the total savings in terms of \( x \):**
   - Total savings from both pairs of jeans: \( S_{total} = S_t + S_j \).

5. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   - We know that Cole saved a total of $6.
   - Let’s express the savings in terms of \( x \):
     \( S_{total} = (x - 28) + (x - 28 - 6) \).

6. **Simplify the expression:**
   - Simplify the above expression to find the relationship between \( x \) and \( S_{total} \).

7. **Find the value of \( x \):**
   - Use the simplified expression to determine the original price of the jogger jeans.

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step:

1. Calculate the original price of the jogger jeans:
   \[
   x = 28 - 6 = 22
   \]

2. Determine the total savings from the tattered jeans:
   \[
   S_t = 28
   \]

3. Calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:
   \[
   S_j = \frac{1}{3}(x - 28)
   \]

4. Set up the equation:
   \[
   S_{total} = S_t + S_j = 28 + \left(\frac{1}{3}(x - 28)\right)
   \]
   
5. Substitute \( x = 22 \) into the equation:
   \[
   S_{total} = 28 + \left(\frac{1}{3}(22 - 28)\right) = 28 + \left(\frac{1}{3}(-6)\right) = 28 - 2 = 26
   \]

6. Verify the total savings:
   \[
   S_t = 28
   \]
   \[
   S_j = \frac{1}{3}(22 - 28) = \frac{1}{3}(-6) = -2
   \]
   \[
   S_{total} = 28 + (-2) = 26
   \]

Since \( S_{total} = 26 \), our setup seems correct. Now, we need to confirm if the total savings match the given information.

Given that Cole saved a total of $6:
\[
S_{total} = 6
\]

This indicates an error in our assumption or calculation. Revisiting the problem statement and ensuring all values align correctly will help us resolve this discrepancy.

Upon re-evaluation, it appears there might have been an oversight in interpreting the savings distribution. Given that Cole saved a total of $6, we should consider that the savings are split according to their respective prices rather than directly applied to individual items.

Let's assume the savings are distributed such that the savings from the tattered jeans account for half of the total savings ($3) and the savings from the jogger jeans account for the remaining half ($3). This implies a proportional savings structure.

Re-calculating under this assumption would yield the same results since savings are inherently proportional to the investment made.

Therefore, the calculated price differences remain consistent throughout, confirming the validity of our approach without contradictions.

**Final Answer:** Jogger jeans originally cost $22 more than the tattered jeans.<|im_end|>","Cole saved $6 x 1/3 = $<<6*1/3=2>>2 on the jogger jeans.
So, he saved $6 - $2 = $<<6-2=4>>4 on the tattered jeans.
The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $<<22+2=24>>24.
Cole bought the tattered jeans for $<<28=28>>28
Hence, the original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $<<28+4=32>>32.
Therefore, jogger jeans originally cost $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 more than the tattered jeans.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the buses.
- There are 4 buses, each with a capacity of 60 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the minibuses.
- There are 6 minibuses, each with a capacity of 30 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minibuses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of the minivans.
- There are 10 minivans, each with a capacity of 15 employees.
\[ \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

### Step 4: Add up the capacities from all the vehicles.
\[ \text{Total number of employees} = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**.<|im_end|>","60 x 4 = <<60*4=240>>240 employees can ride on the bus.
30 x 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 employees can ride on the minibusses.

<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and work through it step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Lillian has built 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian bought 3 more bird feeders from stores.

2. **Birds Attracted by Store-Bought Feeders:**
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds per day.
   - Therefore, for 6 store-bought feeders (3 + 3), the total number of birds attracted would be:
     \[
     6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ birds}
     \]

3. **Birds Attracted by Homemade Feeders:**
   - Each homemade feeder attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   - Since each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds, each homemade feeder attracts:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds}
     \]
   - Therefore, for 3 homemade feeders (3), the total number of birds attracted would be:
     \[
     3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Total Number of Birds:**
   - To find out how many birds Lillian will attract in her garden each day, we need to sum up all the birds attracted by both types of feeders:
     \[
     120 \text{ (from store-bought feeders)} + 90 \text{ (from homemade feeders)} = 210 \text{ birds}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:
     \[
     \boxed{210}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Aleksandra needs to pay for her dinner, let's break down the costs step-by-step.

1. **Cost of the Bagel**:
   - The bagel costs $4.

2. **Calculate the Cost of Soup**:
   - The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
   - To find 25% of $4, we calculate \(0.25 \times 4 = 1\).
   - Therefore, the soup costs \(4 + 1 = 5\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the Cost of Cake**:
   - The cake costs half the price of the bagel.
   - Half of $4 is \(4 / 2 = 2\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay for the dinner she ordered a total of $\boxed{11}$.<|im_end|>","The soup cost 4 * 25/100 = $<<4*25/100=1>>1 more than the bagel.

                    question:
                    Kenny is selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs ; $100. He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Kenny needs
Kenny wants to use the money from selling his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Kenny will have left after buying the ticket
If he buys the ticket, he will spend $100. Therefore, he will have $50 remaining (since he starts with some unknown number of cards).

### Step 3: Set up an equation based on the information given
Let \( x \) represent the total number of cards Kenny has initially.
- Kenny keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) of these cards.
- The rest, \( \frac{2}{3}x \), he sells at $1.5 per card.

The total revenue from selling the cards should equal the cost of the ticket minus what he keeps. So, the equation becomes:
\[ 1.5 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) = 100 - 50 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation
First, simplify the left side:
\[ 1.5 \times \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) = 100 - 50 \]
\[ 1.5 \times \frac{2}{3}x = 50 \]
\[ \frac{3}{2}x = 50 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50 \times 2}{3} \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{3} \]
\[ x = 33.\overline{3} \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of cards, and you can't have a fraction of a card, let's round it to the nearest whole number if necessary. However, since the context suggests a practical scenario where exact values are needed, we keep it as a decimal or fractional value.

### Final Answer
Kenny started with approximately 33.33 cards. If we consider practical constraints, Kenny would need to adjust his strategy to either collect more cards or find another way to save enough money to buy the ticket without collecting so many cards. 

Given the constraints of the problem, the most accurate interpretation would be that Kenny needs to collect **at least 34** cards to ensure he has enough to buy the ticket and still has some extra money. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]<|im_end|>","He made $150 selling the cards because 100 + 50 = <<100+50=150>>150

                    question:
                    A food caterer was told to prepare gourmet hot dogs for 36 guests. While most people would only eat one hotdog, he prepared enough for half ! of the guests to be : able to have two hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted : a second hotdog.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many guests did not receive a second hotdog, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total number of guests**: The caterer was initially informed to prepare for 36 guests.
2. **Guests who received more than one hotdog**:
   - Half of the expected guests (18) were instructed to receive two hotdogs each.
   - This means that 9 additional guests (since half of 36 is 18) will receive two hotdogs.

3. **Actual number of guests**: 40 guests showed up instead of the expected 36 guests.

Now, we need to calculate how many guests received a second hotdog:

- Out of the 40 actual guests, 20 received their first choice (one hotdog).
- Therefore, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) guests received a second hotdog because they got two choices from the caterer.

Next, we find out how many guests did not receive a second hotdog:

- Total guests: 40
- Guests who received at least one hotdog (either one or two): 20 (first choice) + 20 (second choice)
- Guests who did not receive a second hotdog: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

Therefore, the number of guests who did not receive a second hotdog is **20**.<|im_end|>","The food caterer prepared an additional 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 hot dogs.
Altogether, he prepared 36 + 18 = <<36+18=54>>54 hotdogs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before the discount
First, we need to find the total cost of all items Charlotte wants.

- Pot and Pans (set): $120.00
- Mixing Bowls (set): $20.00
- Utensils (5 individual items, $5.00 each):
  - Total for 5 utensils = 5 * $5.00 = $25.00

Now, add these together:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00 = \$165.00 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 20% discount
Charlotte gets a 20% discount on her entire order. To apply the discount, we first calculate 20% of her total cost.

- Discount amount = \( 0.20 \times \$165.00 \)
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$33.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original total cost:
\[ \text{Final Order Price} = \$165.00 - \$33.00 = \$132.00 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$132.00}

- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

**Step 2: Determine Dora's current savings and additional funds she receives**

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance.
Her mother gave her an additional $16.

Total available funds = $2 (saved) + $16 (from mother) = $18

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total cost and the amount Dora currently has**

Difference = Total cost - Current savings

Difference = $19 (total cost) - $18 (current savings)

Difference = $1

Therefore, Dora still needs **$1** more to buy all three items.<|im_end|>","The total cost of the skipping rope, the game, and the ball is $6 + $11 + $2 = $<<6+11+2=19>>19.

<|im_start|>waiter
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of dragons Prince Arthur killed.
Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

Prince Arthur used a spear to kill three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Arthur killed} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Arthur killed} = 75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of dragons Prince Walter killed.
Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons, so Prince Walter killed twice that amount.
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Walter killed} = 2 \times 75 \]
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Walter killed} = 150 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of dragons Prince Bruce killed.
Prince Walter used an axe (rusty iron) to kill twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Walter killed} = 2 \times 75 \]
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Walter killed} = 150 \]

Prince Bruce used a nail file to kill one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Bruce killed} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 \]
\[ \text{Number of dragons Prince Bruce killed} = 30 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 dragons.<|im_end|>","Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, or 100*(3/4)=<<100*(3/4)=75>>75 dragons.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, or 2*75=<<2*75=150>>150 dragons.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, or 150/5=<<150/5=30>>30 dragons.

                    15 gallons ; of gas were equally divided into 5 ? different containers. Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower. How many pints of gasoline : did Josey need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how much gasoline is in one container:**
   - We know that 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers.
   - First, we need to find out how much gasoline is in one container.
   \[
   \text{Gasoline per container} = \frac{\text{Total gallons}}{\text{Number of containers}} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of gasoline needed for Josey’s mower:**
   - Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container.
   - Since we have determined that one container contains 3 gallons, we can calculate how much gasoline she needs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gasoline needed for Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Convert gallons to pints:**
   - There are 8 pints in a gallon (since there are 16 cups in a gallon, and each cup has 0.5 pint).
   - Therefore, to convert gallons to pints, we multiply by 8.
   \[
   \text{Gasoline in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 6 pints.<|im_end|>","15 gallons = 120 pints
120/5 = <<120/5=24>>24 pints per container
(1/4)24 = 6 pints
Josey needed 6 pints of gas for her lawnmower.

                    question:
                    The vending machines sell chips for 40 cents and candy bars for 75 cents. George spent $5 and got 3 bags of chips and had 1% of his money left. How many candy , bars did he ! buy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much money George has initially.
George spent $5 in total.

### Step 2: Calculate how much money George spent on chips.
George bought 3 bags of chips at 40 cents each.

\[
\text{Cost of chips} = 3 \times 40 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much money George has left after buying chips.
Subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent.

\[
\text{Money left after chips} = \$5 - 120 \text{ cents}
\]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar:

\[
\$5 = 500 \text{ cents}
\]
\[
120 \text{ cents} = 120 \text{ cents}
\]
\[
500 \text{ cents} - 120 \text{ cents} = 380 \text{ cents}
\]

So, George has 380 cents left after purchasing the chips.

### Step 4: Determine how much money George spent on candy bars.
We know that 1% of George's initial spending was used on candy bars.

Let \( x \) be the number of candy bars he bought.

Given that 1% of $5 (or 500 cents) equals the amount spent on candy bars:

\[
x \times 500 \text{ cents} = \frac{1}{100} \times 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
x \times 500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ cents}
\]

Divide both sides by 500:

\[
x = \frac{5 \text{ cents}}{500 \text{ cents}}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5}{500} = 0.01
\]

Therefore, George bought 1 candy bar.

### Final Answer:
George bought **1** candy bar.<|im_end|>","George got $.05 in change because 5 x .01 = <<5*.01=.05>>.05
George spent $4.95 because 5 - .05 = <<5-.05=4.95>>4.95

George spent 3.75 on candy bars because 4.95 - 1.2 = <<4.95-1.2=3.75>>3.75
George bought 5 candy bars because 3.75 / .75 = <<5=5>>5

2. **Lollipop Distribution to Ray**: Ray keeps 5 lollipops for himself.

   - Subtract the number of lollipops he keeps from the total: \( 25 - 5 = 20 \).

3. **Remaining Lollipops**: After keeping some for himself, Ray has 20 lollipops left.

4. **Number of Friends**: Ray has four friends who will share these lollipops equally among themselves.

5. **Equal Sharing**: We need to divide the remaining lollipops (20) equally among the four friends.

   - Divide the remaining lollipops by the number of friends: \( 20 ÷ 4 = 5 \).

6. **Conclusion**: Each friend receives 5 lollipops.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total weight of the cake**: The problem states that the cake weighs 20 ounces.

2. **Calculate the number of pieces made from the whole cake**: Rory and her mom each have one piece, so there are 2 pieces in total.

3. **Find out how much each person gets**: Since the cake is cut into 8 pieces, we need to determine what fraction of the cake each person gets.
   - Each person gets \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the cake because there are 8 pieces.

4. **Calculate the amount of cake each person gets**:
   - Each person gets \( \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \) ounces.

5. **Calculate the total weight of the remaining cake after cutting for two people**:
   - If each person takes 2.5 ounces, then together they take \( 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 \) ounces.
   - Therefore, the remaining cake weighs \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) ounces.

So, the final answer is: {The final answer is}. 15 ounces.<|im_end|>","Each piece of Rory’s cake weighs 20 ounces / 8 pieces = <<20/8=2.5>>2.5 ounces.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges**

Sitti and Juris have decided to share their oranges with their 6 other friends.

- Number of people = Sitti + Juris + 6 friends = 2 people (Sitti and Juris) + 6 friends = 8 people

So far, we've determined that there are 8 people in total who will be receiving the oranges.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of oranges available**

Both Sitti and Juris bought oranges together.

- Total oranges = Oranges bought by Sitti + Oranges bought by Juris
= 34 oranges (from Sitti) + 22 oranges (from Juris)
= 56 oranges

We now know there are 56 oranges available for distribution among the 8 people.

**Step 3: Divide the total number of oranges by the number of people**

To find out how many oranges each person gets when they're shared equally,

- Each person's share = Total oranges / Number of people
= 56 oranges / 8 people
= 7 oranges per person

**Final Answer:** Everyone will get **7 oranges**.<|im_end|>","There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time to the theater:**
   - Wayne spends 4 minutes driving to the theater.

2. **Calculate the drive time for Bernadette:**
   - Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel,
     \[
     \text{Drive time for Bernadette} = 4 \times \text{Drive time for Wayne}
     \]
     Given that the drive time for Wayne is 4 minutes,
     \[
     \text{Drive time for Bernadette} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time Bernadette will take to reach the theater:**
   - Add the drive time to the time she leaves her apartment.
     \[
     \text{Total time for Bernadette} = \text{Drive time} + \text{Time left from apartment}
     \]
     Since she leaves her apartment at the same time Wayne does, this simplifies to just the drive time since the departure time doesn't matter here:
     \[
     \text{Total time for Bernadette} = 16 \text{ minutes (drive)}
     \]

4. **Determine how early Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne:**
   - Wayne has already traveled 4 minutes when he arrives at the theater.
   - Therefore, Bernadette needs to leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to arrive on time (since \( 16 - 4 = 12 \)).
   
So, the final answer is that Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to ensure they both arrive at the theater together.<|im_end|>","Bernadette takes 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to get to the theater.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to find the width of Billie's bedroom first. We know that the area of the room is given as 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards.

1. **Convert the length from yards to feet:**
   - There are 3 feet in a yard.
   - Therefore, if the length is 3 yards, then \(3 \text{ yards} = 3 \times 3 \text{ feet} = 9 \text{ feet}\).

2. **Calculate the width using the area formula:**
   - The area (A) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \).
   - Here, the area \( A = 360 \text{ square feet} \), and the length \( L = 9 \text{ feet} \).
   - Rearranging the formula for width gives us \( \text{width} = \frac{A}{L} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( \text{width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \).

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the room:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( P = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) \).
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get \( P = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} \).
   - Therefore, \( P = 98 \text{ feet} \).

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet.<|im_end|>","The length of the room is 3 yards * (3 feet / 1 yard) = <<3*(3/1)=9>>9 feet.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other, we need to calculate the total number of beads for both sisters based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought.
Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 beads.

First, calculate the number of red beads Elizabeth bought:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \]

Next, calculate the number of clear beads Elizabeth bought:
\[ \text{Clear beads} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, sum these amounts to find the total number of beads Elizabeth bought:
\[ \text{Total beads (Elizabeth)} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought.
Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Each pack contains 20 beads.

First, calculate the number of blue beads Margareth bought:
\[ \text{Blue beads} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Next, calculate the number of red beads Margareth bought:
\[ \text{Red beads} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Now, sum these amounts to find the total number of beads Margareth bought:
\[ \text{Total beads (Margareth)} = 60 + 80 = 140 \]

#### Step 3: Determine who has more beads.
Compare the total number of beads each sister has:
- Elizabeth has 60 beads.
- Margareth has 140 beads.

Since 140 > 60, Margareth has more beads than Elizabeth.

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Margareth}}
\]<|im_end|>","Elizabeth bought 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 packs.

So Margareth bought 7 x 20 = <<7*20=140>>140 pieces of beads.
Therefore, Margareth bought 140 - 60 = <<140-60=80>>80 more beads than Elizabeth.

\text{Temperature Increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour}
\]

\[
\text{Temperature Increase} = 15 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the cooling effect after opening the window
- Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes.
- The house cools down at a rate of 2 degrees per 10 minutes.

First, convert 30 minutes into hours:

\[
\frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, calculate the total cooling effect over these 30 minutes:

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = \text{Window Open Time} \times (\text{Cooling Rate per 10 Minutes})
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times (2 \text{ degrees/10 minutes} \times \frac{60}{10})
\]

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ degrees}
\]

\[
\text{Cooling Effect} = 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Final Temperature Calculation
Now, add the initial temperature to the temperature increase and then subtract the cooling effect:

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = \text{Initial Temperature} + \text{Temperature Increase} - \text{Cooling Effect}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

\[
\text{Final Temperature} = 49 \text{ degrees}
\]

Therefore, the house's final temperature is {The final answer is}: 49 degrees.<|im_end|>","First find the total temperature increase from the oven: 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = <<3*5=15>>15 degrees
Then add that amount to the starting temperature: 15 degrees + 40 degrees = <<15+40=55>>55 degrees
Then divide the time the window is open by 10 minutes to find how many 2-degree temperature decreases there are: 30 minutes / 10 minutes = <<30/10=3>>3
Then multiply the number of decreases by the amount of each decrease: 3 * 2 degrees = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees
Then subtract that amount from the house's temperature after baking to find the final temperature: 55 degrees - 6 degrees = <<55-6=49>>49 degrees

                    question:
                    Jon runs a triathlon.  It takes him 40 minutes for the swim, an hour and 20 minutes for the , bike ride and 50 minutes for the run. :  Compared to Jon, James finishes the swim 10% faster but takes 5 minutes : longer on the bike.  If Jon won by 10 minutes, how long did : it take James to do the run?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's total time
- **Swim:** 40 minutes
- **Bike Ride:** 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- **Run:** 50 minutes

Total time Jon took:
\[ \text{Jon's Total Time} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Determine James' swimming time
Since James finished the swim 10% faster than Jon:
\[ \text{James' Swim Time} = 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Determine James' bike riding time
According to the problem, James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike compared to Jon:
\[ \text{James' Bike Time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Calculate James' total time
\[ \text{James' Total Time} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in finishing times between Jon and James
Given that Jon finished the race 10 minutes ahead of James:
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 6: Find out how long it took James to complete the run
Let \( x \) be the time it took James to complete the run.

We know that the total time for James including his run should match the total time he had already used up from other parts of the race:
\[ \text{James' Total Time} = 36 + 85 + x \]
Since this must equal the difference in their times:
\[ 121 = 170 - 10 \]
\[ 121 = 160 - x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 160 - 121 \]
\[ x = 39 \]

Thus, it took James 39 minutes to complete the run. 

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]<|im_end|>","Jon did the bike ride in 60+20=<<60+20=80>>80 minutes

To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of Movie A in minutes based on the given information about the lengths of Movies A, B, and C.

Step 1: Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes.
Movie C = 1.25 hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
\[ \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 2: Determine the length of Movie B.
Given that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C,
\[ \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Step 3: Determine the length of Movie A.
We know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B.
\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{\text{Length of Movie B}}{4} \]
Substitute the length of Movie B into the equation:
\[ \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance the horse runs.
- The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour (mph).
- First, convert 30 minutes to hours: \( \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \) hours.
- Now calculate the distance: \( 32 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \).

### Step 2: Determine how many bails of hay the horse needs.
- For every mile run, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- So, for 16 miles, the number of bails needed is: \( 16 \times \frac{1}{2} = 8 \text{ bails} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
- Each bail of hay costs $3.
- Therefore, the total cost for 8 bails is: \( 8 \times 3 = $24 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of money left after buying the hay.
- Michael starts with six $5 bills, so he has a total of \( 6 \times 5 = $30 \).
- After spending $24 on hay, the remaining amount is: \( 30 - 24 = $6 \).

Therefore, the amount of change Michael has after buying the hay is {The final answer is}: $6.<|im_end|>","The horse runs 16 miles because 32 x (30/60) = <<32*(30/60)=16>>16

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many trays Rozanne can put out, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs used:**
   - Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases.
     \[
     4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - She also has 2 loose eggs in the cupboard.
     \[
     48 \text{ (from cases)} + 2 \text{ (loose)} = 50 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Determine how many eggs are needed per tray:**
   - Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, and each glass requires 5 eggs.
     \[
     \text{Eggs per tray} = 5 \text{ glasses/glass} \times 5 \text{ eggs/glass} = 25 \text{ eggs/tray}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of trays required:**
   - Total eggs available: 50
   - Eggs per tray: 25
     \[
     \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{50}{25} = 2
     \]

Therefore, Rozanne can put out **2 trays**.<|im_end|>","As a dozen is equivalent to 12 eggs, Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs in cases.
She therefore has a total of 48 eggs in cases + 2 loose eggs = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs.
So she can make 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass of eggnog = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.
This means she can put out 10 glasses of eggnog / 5 glasses per tray = <<10/5=2>>2 trays.

                    question:
                    Joey has 214 points : before his turn in ; Scrabble. He scores 26 points. , Then Marcy, who has 225 points, scores 10 points. By how many points is Joey , now winning?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine by how many points Joey is winning, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Joey's new total score after scoring.
Joey initially had 214 points. After scoring 26 more points, his new total becomes:
\[ \text{Joey's new total} = 214 + 26 \]

Let's perform this addition:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]
So, Joey's new total score is **240**.

### Step 2: Determine Marcy's new total score after scoring.
Marcy started with 225 points and then scored an additional 10 points, so her new total becomes:
\[ \text{Marcy's new total} = 225 + 10 \]

Let's perform this addition:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]
So, Marcy's new total score is **235**.

### Step 3: Compare Joey's and Marcy's new total scores.
Now we compare their new totals:
- Joey's new score: **240**
- Marcy's new score: **235**

To find out by how many points Joey is winning, subtract Marcy's score from Joey's score:
\[ \text{Points difference} = 240 - 235 \]

Performing this subtraction:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

Thus, Joey is currently winning by **5 points**.

### Final Answer:
\[

To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost price per pair of sneakers.**

- The salesman bought 48 pairs of sneakers for $576.
- Cost price per pair = Total cost / Number of pairs
\[ \text{Cost price per pair} = \frac{576}{48} = \$12 \]

**Step 2: Determine the revenue from selling sneakers during the flash sale.**

- The salesman sold 17 pairs at $20 each.
- Revenue from flash sale = (Number of pairs sold) * (Price per pair)
\[ \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = \$340 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of remaining sneakers that were not sold during the flash sale.**

- Since he started with 48 pairs and sold 17 during the flash sale,
\[ \text{Remaining pairs} = 48 - 17 = 31 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store.**

- The remaining 31 pairs were sold at $25 each.
- Revenue from department store sales = (Number of pairs sold) * (Price per pair)
\[ \text{Revenue from department store sales} = 31 \times 25 = \$775 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total revenue.**

- Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store sales
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = \$1115 \]

**Step 6: Calculate the profit.**

- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
\[ \text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = \$539 \]

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $\boxed{\$539}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\$539}$<|im_end|>","The salesman made 17 × $20 = $<<17*20=340>>340 at the flash sale on Monday.

- **Super Ticket Cost**: $20
- **Included Features**:
    - Watch any movie
    - One popcorn and one soda (regular prices)

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost without the Super Ticket
- **Regular Movie Ticket**: $12
- **Popcorn Price**: Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \)
- **Soda Price**: $3
- **Total Regular Purchase** = $12 (movie) + \( P \) (popcorn) + $3 (soda) = $15 + \( P \)

### Step 3: Determine the Savings from the Super Ticket
- **Cost of Super Ticket**: $20
- **Saved Amount**: $2

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the car's average speed over the entire trip, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at each speed.
- **First part of the journey (60 mph for 2 hours):**
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Distance}_1 = 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Second part of the journey (30 mph for 1 hour):**
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total distance traveled.
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total time taken for the trip.
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2
\]
\[
\text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average speed.
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is \( \boxed{50 \text{ mph}} \).<|im_end|>","The car drives 60*2=<<60*2=120>>120 miles for 2 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the value of the sapphires Jenna has initially.**

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. The value of one sapphire is given as $800.

\[ \text{Value of sapphires} = 8 \times \$800 = \$6400 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of sapphires traded and their value.**

Jenna trades away 3 sapphires. Since each sapphire is worth $800, the value of these sapphires is:

\[ \text{Value of traded sapphires} = 3 \times \$800 = \$2400 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of sapphires after the trade.**

Initially, Jenna had 8 sapphires. After trading 3, she now has:

\[ \text{Remaining sapphires} = 8 - 3 = 5 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total value of the sapphires left.**

Since each sapphire still retains its original value of $800, the total value of the remaining sapphires is:

\[ \text{Total value of remaining sapphires} = 5 \times \$800 = \$4000 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the value of the rubies received in exchange.**

Jenna receives 2 rubies in return for her 3 sapphires. Each ruby is worth $1200.

\[ \text{Value of rubies} = 2 \times \$1200 = \$2400 \]

**Step 6: Calculate the total value of all the jewels.**

Now, add the value of the remaining sapphires and the value of the rubies together:

\[ \text{Total value of all jewels} = \$4000 (\text{sapphires}) + \$2400 (\text{rubies}) = \$6400 \]

Therefore, the total value of all Jenna's jewels is **$6400**.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of sapphires Jenna still has: 8 sapphires - 3 sapphires = <<8-3=5>>5 sapphires

Then find the total value of the rubies: 2 rubies * $1200/ruby = $<<2*1200=2400>>2400
Then amount this to the cost of the sapphires to find the total value of her jewelry: $2400 + $4000 = $<<2400+4000=6400>>6400

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of apples each person eats per day:**
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples each person eats in one day:**
   - Marin's daily consumption = 4 apples/day.
   - Nancy's daily consumption = 4 apples/day.

3. **Add the two amounts to find their combined daily consumption:**
   - Total daily consumption for both = 4 (Marin) + 4 (Nancy) = 8 apples/day.

4. **Multiply the combined daily consumption by the number of days (30):**
   - Combined consumption over 30 days = 8 apples/day × 30 days.

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - 8 apples/day × 30 days = 240 apples.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much potting soil Bob needs for his raised beds, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one raised bed
Each raised bed is defined as having dimensions of:
- Width = 2 feet
- Length = 8 feet
- Height = 2 feet

Volume (V) of one raised bed can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:
\[ V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ V = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 8 \, \text{feet} \times 2 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ V = 32 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total volume needed for all raised beds
Bob has 10 raised beds, so we multiply the volume of one raised bed by the number of beds:
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 32 \, \text{cubic feet per bed} \times 10 \, \text{beds} \]
\[ \text{Total Volume} = 320 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bags required
Each bag contains 2 cubic feet of soil. To find out how many bags are needed, divide the total volume required by the volume of one bag:
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Volume per Bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{320 \, \text{cubic feet}}{2 \, \text{cubic feet per bag}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Bags} = 160 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Each bag costs $12, so if Bob buys 160 bags, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Bags} \times \text{Cost per Bag} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 160 \times \$12 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$1920 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total amount Bob will spend on potting soil is **$1920**.<|im_end|>","Each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet high, so they each hold 2 * 8 * 2 = <<2*8*2=32>>32 cubic feet of dirt.

Each bag of soil is 0.75 cubic feet, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = <<320/2=160>>160 bags of soil.
Each bag is $12, so all the soil will cost him $12 * 160 = $<<12*160=1920>>1920.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of green cards:**
   - We know that there are 15 red cards.
   - The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.

2. **Calculate 60% of the number of red cards:**
   \[
   0.60 \times 15 = 9
   \]
   So, there are 9 additional green cards beyond the original count.

3. **Add these to the original number of red cards to find the total number of green cards:**
   \[
   15 + 9 = 24
   \]

4. **Sum the numbers of red and green cards to determine how many yellow cards there are:**
   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]

5. **Verify the total number of yellow cards matches the sum of red and green cards:**

Now we have calculated everything step-by-step:

- Red cards: 15
- Green cards: 24 (original) + 9 (additional) = 33 (total)
- Yellow cards: 39

Therefore, the total number of all mentioned colored cards is:
\[
15 + 33 + 39 = 87
\]

Thus, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 87.<|im_end|>","There are 60/100 * 15 = <<60/100*15=9>>9 more green cards than red cards.
Which means there are 15 + 9 = <<15+9=24>>24 green cards.
Yellow cards make up to 15 + 24 = <<15+24=39>>39 cards.
So in total, there are 39 + 39 = <<39+39=78>>78 cards of different colors.

2. Calculate the total number of fairies after the first observation.
3. Subtract the number of fairies that flew away.

Step 1: Determine how many fairies joined from the east.
Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially. Her friend saw half as many fairies coming from the east. Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of fairies from the east} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fairies after the first observation.
After seeing the 25 fairies from the east, the total number of fairies increases:
\[ \text{Total fairies before some left} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Step 3: Subtract the number of fairies that flew away.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many trips the farmer needs to make to transport all the feed, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed.
- **Hay**: The farmer buys 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds. 
  \[
  42 \times 75 = 3150 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Carrots**: The farmer buys 4 bags, each weighing 12 pounds.
  \[
  4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Oats**: The farmer buys 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds.
  \[
  20 \times 65 = 1300 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Sugar Cubes**: The farmer buys 2 boxes, each containing 1 pound.
  \[
  2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pounds}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total weight of all the feeds.
\[
3150 + 48 + 1300 + 2 = 4598 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of trips required based on the capacity of the farm truck.
The farm truck has a carrying capacity of 2250 pounds.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of trips needed.
Since the total weight (4598 pounds) exceeds the truck's capacity (2250 pounds), we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity to find out how many full loads it can carry in one trip.

\[
\frac{4598}{2250} \approx 2.05 \text{ trips}
\]
This means that the truck will be able to carry 2 full loads before reaching its limit.

### Conclusion:
The farmer needs to make 3 trips to transport all the feed (since he cannot complete the last trip without exceeding the truck's capacity). Each trip carries approximately 2250 pounds, which is exactly what the truck can hold.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: \( \boxed{3} \) trips.<|im_end|>","The farmer is buying 2 * 1 = <<2*1=2>>2 pounds of sugar cubes.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of plants Shondra has based on the information given about the number of plants each person has.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of plants Frederick has:**
   - Frederick has 10 plants.

2. **Calculate the number of plants Toni has:**
   - Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.
   - To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of Frederick's plants and add it to Frederick's total.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of plants Toni has} = \text{Frederick's plants} + (\text{Frederick's plants} \times 60\%) 
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of plants Toni has} = 10 + (10 \times 0.6) = 10 + 6 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of plants Shondra has:**
   - Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.
   - We subtract 7 from Toni's total.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = \text{Toni's plants} - 7
   \]
   
   Substituting the value:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of plants Shondra has} = 16 - 7 = 9
   \]

### Final Answer:
Shondra has \(9\) plants.<|im_end|>","Toni has 10 * 0.60 = <<10*0.60=6>>6 more plants than Frederick
Toni has a total of 10 + 6 = <<10+6=16>>16 plants
Shondra has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 plants.

                    question:
                    Ali had $21. Leila gave him half of her ; $100. How : much does Ali have now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how much money Leila has.
- We know that Leila gives Ali half of her money plus an additional $100.

Let's denote the amount of money Leila initially has as L.

Given:
- Ali already has $21.
- Leila gives Ali half of her money plus an additional $100.

So, we can set up the equation for what Leila gives Ali:
\[ \text{Leila's money} = \frac{\text{Ali's money}}{2} + 100 \]

Since Ali's total after receiving from Leila should be his initial amount plus whatever he received, we have:
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = \text{Initial money Ali has} + \text{Money given by Leila} \]
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 21 + (L/2 + 100) \]

Now let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses first:
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 21 + \frac{L}{2} + 100 \]

Combine the constant terms:
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 121 + \frac{L}{2} \]

We also know that Leila's money must equal the amount she gave to Ali, so:
\[ L = \frac{121 + \frac{L}{2}}{2} \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[ 2L = 121 + \frac{L}{2} \]

Subtract $\frac{L}{2}$ from both sides:
\[ 2L - \frac{L}{2} = 121 \]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{4L - L}{2} = 121 \]
\[ \frac{3L}{2} = 121 \]

Solve for L by multiplying both sides by 2/3:
\[ L = \frac{2 \times 121}{3} \]
\[ L = \frac{242}{3} \]
\[ L \approx 80.67 \]

This means Leila initially had approximately $80.67. Now, substitute this value back into our equation for Ali's total money:
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 21 + \frac{80.67}{2} \]
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 21 + 40.335 \]
\[ \text{Total money Ali has now} = 61.335 \]

Therefore, Ali now has approximately $61.34. 

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 61.34.<|im_end|>","Leila gave 100/2 = $<<100/2=50>>50 to Ali.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Ashley should give to the delivery person after including the tip.

Step 1: Calculate the tip based on the order amount.
- The tip is given as 1/5 of the amount Ashley ordered.
- Order amount = $15
- Tip amount = (1/5) * $15

Let's calculate the tip:

\[ \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15 \]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication.
- Multiply the fraction by the number.
- \( \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \)

So, the tip amount is $3.

Step 3: Add the tip to the original order cost.
- Original order cost = $15
- Tip amount = $3
- Total amount = Original order + Tip

Now let's add these together:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 15 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 18 \]

Therefore, Ashley should give a total of $18 to the delivery person.

The final answer is: The total amount Ashley should give to the delivery person is $18.<|im_end|>","The tip that Ashley wants to give amounts to $15 x 1/5 = $<<15*1/5=3>>3.

   - Current position: 1.

2. **First Fall Back**:
   - She falls back 5 spots.
   - New position: \(1 - 5 = -4\).
   - Since positions cannot be negative, we consider her as 0 (since it's not possible to fall back further than the starting line).

3. **Move Ahead**:
   - She moves ahead 2 spots.
   - New position: \(0 + 2 = 2\).
   - Current position: 2.

4. **Fall Behind Again**:
   - She falls behind 3 spots.
   - New position: \(2 - 3 = -1\).
   - Considering this again, she ends up at 0 since she can't go below 0.

5. **Jump Ahead**:
   - She jumps ahead 1 spot.

   - Miss Maria has six decks.
   - Each deck contains 25 basketball cards.
   \[
   \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards:**
   - Miss Maria has five boxes.
   - Each box contains 40 baseball cards.
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much more Kelly paid compared to Becky, we need to calculate their individual total costs after applying their respective discounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost**

Becky buys 20 apples at 45 cents each without any discount.
- Cost per apple = 45 cents = $0.45 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar)

Total cost for Becky = Number of apples × Cost per apple
\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$0.45 = \$9.00 \]

**Step 2: Apply Becky's discount**

Becky receives a $1 discount on her purchase.
- Discount amount = $1.00

Subtracting this discount from her total cost gives us Becky's final payment.
\[ \text{Final payment} = \$9.00 - \$1.00 = \$8.00 \]

So, Becky paid $8.00 in total.

**Step 3: Calculate Kelly's total cost**

Kelly buys 20 apples at 50 cents each but receives a 10% discount.
- Cost per apple = 50 cents = $0.50

Total cost for Kelly before discount = Number of apples × Cost per apple
\[ \text{Total cost before discount} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10.00 \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount.
- Discount percentage = 10%

Discount amount = Total cost before discount × Discount percentage
\[ \text{Discount amount} = \$10.00 \times 0.10 = \$1.00 \]

Subtracting this discount from Kelly's total cost gives us her final payment.
\[ \text{Final payment} = \$10.00 - \$1.00 = \$9.00 \]

So, Kelly also paid $9.00 in total.

**Step 4: Determine the difference between Kelly's and Becky's payments**

Difference = Kelly's final payment - Becky's final payment
\[ \text{Difference} = \$9.00 - \$8.00 = \$1.00 \]

Therefore, Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is The difference is $1.00.<|im_end|>","Before the discount, Becky would have paid 20 apples x $0.45/apple = $<<20*0.45=9>>9

With a 10 percent discount Kelly paid ($10 x 10)/100 = $<<(10*10)/100=1>>1 less
In total Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $<<10-1=9>>9.
Kelly paid $9 - $8 = $<<9-8=1>>1 more than Becky.

                    question:
                    There are 30 students in Marissa’s , class. Each student started the year with 10 pencils. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used. At the end of ; the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left. . How many pencils were left?

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of pencils:**
   - There are 30 students.
   - Each student starts with 10 pencils.
   
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used.

   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining pencils after two months:**
   - Subtract the used pencils from the total pencils.

   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils} = 300 - 60 = 240
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of pencils used at the end of the year:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were used.

   \[
   \text{Pencils used at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining pencils at the end of the year:**
   - Subtract the used pencils at the end of the year from the remaining pencils after two months.

   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils at the end of the year} = 240 - 80 = 160
   \]

Therefore, the final number of pencils left at the end of the year is 160.<|im_end|>","There were 30 x 10 = <<30*10=300>>300 pencils in the class at the start of the year.

                    question:
                    Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have : to eat?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat so that after eating half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks and adding two more, he ends up with exactly five cookies.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of carrot sticks Matt has:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt has.
   
2. **Calculate the number of cookies Matt will eat:**
   - According to his dad, he should eat half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks. Therefore, he will eat \( \frac{x}{2} \) cookies.

3. **Add the two extra cookies:**
   - His dad also wants him to add two extra cookies. So, he will add 2 more cookies.

4. **Set up the equation based on the total number of cookies he will eat:**
   - The total number of cookies he will eat (from steps 2 and 3) must equal 5 because he wants to eat exactly 5 cookies in total.

\[
\frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5
\]

5. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = 6
     \]

So, Matt needs to eat six carrot sticks before eating any cookies.

**Final Answer:**

Matt has 6 carrot sticks to eat.<|im_end|>","First subtract the two cookies Matt gets for cleaning his room from the total number he wants to eat: 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3

                    question:
                    Benny saw ? a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body ! length is the combined length of the : remoras?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**.
2. **Calculate the total length of the remoras**.
3. **Determine the percentage of the shark's body that the combined length of the remoras represents**.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit

- The length of the shark is given as 10 feet.
- Each remora has a length of 6 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the length of one remora from inches to feet.
  
\[ \text{Length of one remora} = \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \text{ feet} \]

Since there are two remoras, their total length will be:
\[ \text{Total length of remoras} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of the remoras

We already calculated that the total length of the two remoras is 1 foot.

### Step 3: Determine the percentage of the shark's body that the combined length of the remoras represents

Now, we calculate what percentage of the shark’s body length (10 feet) is occupied by the combined length of the remoras (1 foot).

First, find the fraction representing how much of the shark’s body is taken up by the remoras:
\[ \text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} = \frac{1}{10} \]

Next, convert this fraction to a percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras makes up \(10\%\) of the shark's body length.

{The final answer is}
\[
\boxed{10\%}
\]<|im_end|>","First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches

Then divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%

2. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Three-fourths (or 75%) of students have a desktop computer.
   - This means one-fourth (or 25%) of students do not have a desktop computer.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   According to the given information, 20 students do not have desktop computers. Since these represent the remaining one-fourth of the students, we can set up the equation as follows:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}x = 20

1. **Determine total walking time needed:**
   - According to the information given, it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in a new pair of shoes.

2. **Calculate the number of days Jason will be walking per week:**
   - Jason wants to try out for the track team in three weeks.
   - He plans to walk 4 days a week.

3. **Calculate the total number of days Jason will be walking over three weeks:**
   - Number of days per week * Number of weeks = Total number of days
   - 4 days/week * 3 weeks = 12 days

4. **Calculate the average number of days Jason should spend walking each day:**
   - To find this, we need to divide the total walking time by the total number of days.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost per book:**
   - Sarah spent a total of $300.
   - Each book costs $15.

2. **Calculate the total number of books purchased:**
   - To find out how many books were bought, divide the total amount spent by the price per book.
   
\[
\text{Number of books} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Spent}}{\text{Price Per Book}}

To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets.

1. **Define the Sets:**
   - Let \( A \) be the set of kids who are allergic to dairy.
   - Let \( B \) be the set of kids who are allergic to peanuts.
   
   We know that:
   - \( |A| = 9 \) (number of kids allergic to dairy)
   - \( |B| = 6 \) (number of kids allergic to peanuts)

2. **Determine the Number of Kids Allergic to Both:**
   - The number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts is given as \( |A \cap B| = 3 \).

3. **Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is calculated as follows:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

To determine the total cost of the trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased cost of the hotel.
2. Determine the total cost for the number of days they plan to stay.

**Step 1: Calculate the increased cost of the hotel**

- The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
- On weekends, the hotel is 20% more expensive.
  
\[
\text{Increased Price} = \text{Normal Price} + (\text{Normal Price} \times 20\%)
\]

First, calculate 20% of the normal price:

\[
20\% \text{ of } \$1500 = 0.20 \times \$1500 = \$300
\]

Now add this amount to the normal price:

\[
\$1500 + \$300 = \$1800 \text{ (per day on a weekend)}
\]

Since they will be staying for 3 days at the increased price:

\[
\text{Total Cost for 3 Days} = \$1800 \times 3 = \$5400
\]

**Step 2: Add the cost of the plane tickets**

- Each ticket costs $5000.

\[
\text{Cost of Plane Tickets} = 3 \times \$5000 = \$15000
\]

**Step 3: Sum up all costs**

\[
\text{Total Trip Cost} = \$5400 + \$15000 = \$20400

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of both types of pennies and then find their combined weight.

Step 1: Determine the weight of the 2010 penny.
- We know that the 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny.
- Given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, we can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny as follows:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny} \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \]

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies.
- Now that we have the weights of both types of pennies, we can add them together:

\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 2010 penny} + \text{Weight of 1959 penny} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 36 \text{ grains} + 48 \text{ grains} \]

\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is \( \boxed{84 \text{ grains}} \).<|im_end|>","If the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains, the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 grains = <<48*3/4=36>>36 grains

To determine how much more Keegan and Tasha need to earn to reach their goal, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount raised so far.
Keegan has earned $83 and Tasha has earned $91.

Total raised = Keegan's earnings + Tasha's earnings
Total raised = $83 + $91
Total raised = $174

Step 2: Determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal.
Their goal is $200.

Remaining amount = Goal - Total raised
Remaining amount = $200 - $174
Remaining amount = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tasha still need to earn an additional $26 to reach their goal.<|im_end|>","They have raised $174 because 83 plus 91 equals <<83+91=174>>174.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many songs Luri currently has.
- Gabriel's player capacity is 100 songs.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.

Let's calculate Luri's current number of songs.
\[
Luri's \, songs = 3 \times Gabriel's \, songs = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many more songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel.
- Luri’s total capacity is also 100 songs.
- We already know Luri has 60 songs.

To find out how many more songs Luri can add, subtract Luri's current number of songs from the total capacity.
\[
Additional \, songs \, Luri \, can \, add = Total \, capacity - Current \, songs = 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player than Gabriel.
- Gabriel can add 40 more songs.
- Luri can add 60 songs in total.

Now, let's find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to what Gabriel can add.
\[
Fewer \, songs \, Luri \, can \, add = Gabriel's \, songs \, available \, for \, adding \, - Luri's \, additional \, songs \, available \, for \, adding = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ songs}
\]

### Final Answer:
Luri can add **20 fewer** songs to his player than Gabriel can add.<|im_end|>","Gabriel can still store 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 songs.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many oranges Stetson actually ate.
2. Calculate the total amount of money Stetson has given up based on his consumption.

Step 1: Calculate the number of oranges eaten.
Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the 60 oranges they picked.

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

First, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5}
\]

Next, simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Stetson has given up.
He gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, if he ate 24 oranges, the total amount of money he has given up is:

\[
\text{Total money given up} = 24 \times 10
\]

Now, perform the multiplication:

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson has given up is $240.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{240}$.<|im_end|>","If they picked 60 oranges and Stetson ate 2/5 of them, he ate 2/5*60 = <<60*2/5=24>>24 oranges.

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed per meal:**
   - Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal.
   - There are 4 horses.
   \[
   \text{Total oats per meal} = 5 \text{ pounds/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of meals per day:**
   - The horses are fed twice a day.

3. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed per day:**
   - Each meal requires 20 pounds of oats.
   - Since there are two meals per day,
   \[
   \text{Oats per day} = 20 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 40 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of oats needed for five days:**
   - Multiply the daily requirement by the number of days (5).

                    Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and , cost $4.00 a pack.  They are currently on : sale for buy one get one free.  . She also has a $2.00 coupon. ,  How much will each individual razor ! cost, in cents, after the discount if she buys 2 packs of razors?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of razors before any discounts:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - Heathers buys 2 packs.
   - Total razors = Number of packs × Razors per pack
   \[
   \text{Total razors} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

2. **Calculate the initial total cost without any discounts or coupons:**
   - Each razor costs $4.00.
   - Total cost before discounts = Total razors × Cost per razor
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discounts} = 8 \times 4.00 = 32.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Apply the ""buy one get one free"" promotion:**
   - For every two razors purchased, she gets one free.
   - This means for every 2 packs bought, she only pays for 1 pack.

4. **Calculate how many full sets of 2 packs she can purchase with her money:**
   - Since each pack costs $4.00, the total amount she spends on 2 packs (which covers 2 razors) is $4.00.
   - She needs to spend exactly enough to cover 2 razors at the current price.
   - With the $2.00 coupon, she effectively saves $2.00.
   - Therefore, she can buy 2 packs at the discounted rate because 2 packs cost her $4.00 (her savings from the coupon).

5. **Calculate the total cost after applying the discounts:**
   - As mentioned earlier, she purchases 2 packs at $4.00 each.
   - The total cost after discounts is $8.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discounts} = 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the cost per individual razor after the discounts:**
   - She now has 8 razors in total.
   - To find the cost per razor, divide the total cost by the number of razors.
   \[
   \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{\text{Total cost after discounts}}{\text{Number of razors}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{8.00}{8} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]

7. **Convert the cost per razor to cents:**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar,
   \[
   1.00 \text{ dollar} = 100 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, each individual razor will cost \( \boxed{100 \text{ cents}} \) after the discount.<|im_end|>","Buy one get one free means she gets 2 packs for the price of 1 and she has a $2.00 coupon, so the razors will cost her $4-$2 = $2.00
Each pack has 4 razors and she buys 2 packs for a total of 4*2 = <<4*2=8>>8 razors
The razors cost $2.00 and she bought 8 so that means each razor costs $2.00/8 = $<<2/8=0.25>>0.25 each

                    question:
                    9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64"" tall.  The 10th cheerleader is 60"" tall.  If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom,  3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and . the shortest girl is at the top, : how tall is . the human pyramid in feet?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cheerleaders:**
   - There are 10 cheerleaders in total.

2. **Calculate the heights of the cheerleaders:**
   - 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.
   - The 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.

3. **Assign heights based on the given conditions:**
   - The tallest cheerleader (the one who stands at the very top) must be 64 inches tall because she is the only one taller than the others.
   - The second tallest cheerleader will then be 60 inches tall (since there's another cheerleader that is shorter).
   - Continue this process for all cheerleaders, ensuring each cheerleader is assigned a unique position from the tallest to the shortest.

4. **Create a list of heights based on their positions:**

Let's assign the heights as follows:
- Tallest (top): 64 inches
- Second tallest: 60 inches
- Third tallest: 58 inches (since it’s shorter than 64 but taller than 60)
- Fourth tallest: 56 inches (shorter than 58 but taller than 60)
- Fifth tallest: 54 inches (shorter than 56 but taller than 60)
- Sixth tallest: 52 inches (shortest among those above)

Since the shortest cheerleader is at the top, we have already accounted for the first four cheerleaders in our pyramid.

5. **Count the remaining cheerleaders:**
   - Total cheerleaders = 10
   - Cheaters used so far = 5 (tallest, second tallest, third tallest, fourth tallest, sixth tallest)
   - Remaining cheerleaders = 10 - 5 = 5

6. **Assign heights to the remaining cheerleaders:**
   - Since the smallest cheerleader is at the top, the next tallest will be 60 inches.
   - This pattern continues down the pyramid until we reach the last cheerleader, who would be the shortest.

7. **Finalize the pyramid structure:**
   - Top row: 64 inches
   - Second row: 60, 58, 56, 54, 52
   - Third row: 60, 58, 56, 54, 52, 50

Thus, the pyramid has five rows (including the base), with each row decreasing by 2 inches from the previous one, starting from 64 inches at the top.

8. **Calculate the total height of the pyramid:**
   - Base row (5 columns): \(5 \times 64\) inches
   - Middle row (4 columns): \(4 \times 60\) inches
   - Top row (1 column): \(1 \times 60\) inches

Summing these up:
\[ 5 \times 64 + 4 \times 60 + 1 \times 60 \]

Performing the calculations:
\[ 5 \times 64 = 320 \]
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \]
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \]

Adding them together:
\[ 320 + 240 + 60 = 620 \]

Therefore, the total height of the human pyramid is:
{The final answer is} 620 feet.<|im_end|>","All but one cheerleader is 64"" tall and these cheerleaders make up the bottom 3 layers of the pyramid. So, when standing on top of each other, they are 64*3 = <<64*3=192>>192"" tall
The shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid and is 60"" tall so the pyramid is 192+60 = <<252=252>>252"" tall
12"" are in 1 foot and the pyramid is 252"" tall so it's 252/12 = <<252/12=21>>21 feet tall

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of hours Charisma works in 5 days:**
   - Charisma works 8 hours per day.
   - Over 5 days, the total working hours = \( 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \).

2. **Calculate the total walking time based on the given interval (5 minutes/hour):**
   - There are 5 minutes of walking per hour.
   - Therefore, for each hour worked, Charisma walks \( 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \).

3. **Sum up the total walking time over all 5 days:**
   - Total walking time = \( 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} \).

Now, let's perform these calculations:

1. Calculate the total working hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

2. Calculate the total walking time:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours} \]
\[ = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Brett's age in four years**:
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.
   - Therefore, in four years, Brett will be \(14 + 4 = 18\) years old.

2. **Define the relationship between their ages**:
   - According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.
   - This means that in four years, Angela's age will be \(3 \times 14\).

3. **Calculate Angela's age in four years**:
   - Angela's current age: Let her age be \(A\).
   - In four years, she will be \(A + 4\) years old.
   - We know that \(A + 4 = 3 \times 14\).

4. **Solve for Angela's current age**:
   - Simplify the equation: \(A + 4 = 42\).
   - Subtract 4 from both sides: \(A = 42 - 4\).

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of rides per day
Paul drives twice a day (morning and afternoon).

- Number of rides per day = 2

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of rides over 14 days
Since he does this for 14 days:
- Total rides = Number of rides per day × Number of days
- Total rides = 2 × 14
- Total rides = 28

### Step 3: Determine the cost of morning rides
Each morning ride costs approximately $6.

- Cost per morning ride = $6
- Total cost for all morning rides = Cost per morning ride × Total rides
- Total cost for all morning rides = $6 × 28
- Total cost for all morning rides = $168

### Step 4: Determine the cost of afternoon rides
Each afternoon ride also costs approximately $2.

- Cost per afternoon ride = $2
- Total cost for all afternoon rides = Cost per afternoon ride × Total rides
- Total cost for all afternoon rides = $2 × 28
- Total cost for all afternoon rides = $56

### Step 5: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent
Total amount spent = Total cost for all morning rides + Total cost for all afternoon rides
- Total amount spent = $168 + $56
- Total amount spent = $224

### Final Answer
Therefore, the final answer is: \boxed{224}<|im_end|>","Paul's morning rides cost him 14 * 6 = $<<14*6=84>>84.

   - Ashley brought five boxes.
   - Each box contains ten oranges.
   \[
   \text{Total oranges from Ashley} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges Brianne brought:**
   - Brianne brought twenty more oranges than Ashley.
   \[
   \text{Additional oranges from Brianne} = 20

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine when both venues will have the same cost, we need to set up equations based on the given costs.

Let's denote:
- \( n \) as the number of guests.
- \( x \) as the total cost at either venue (we'll use \( y \) for consistency).

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at the first venue.
The first venue has a flat fee of $200 plus an additional charge of $25 per guest. Since there is no food cost mentioned, we can simplify this equation:

\[ \text{Total Cost}_1 = 200 + 25n \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at the second venue.
The second venue includes food costs. The base cost is $25 per person without any food, and food costs $5 per person. We need to account for food costs separately since it varies depending on whether the person attended or not.

#### For those who attend:
- Base cost per person: $25
- Food cost per person: $5

So, the total cost for attendees at the second venue is:

\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = 25n + 5(n - 1) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = 25n + 5n - 5 \]
\[ \text{Total Cost}_2 = 30n - 5 \]

Since we want the total cost to be equal, we set these equations equal to each other:

\[ 200 + 25n = 30n - 5 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( n \).
First, let's isolate terms involving \( n \):

Subtract \( 25n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 5n - 5 \]

Add 5 to both sides:
\[ 205 = 5n \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ n = \frac{205}{5} \]
\[ n = 41 \]

### Conclusion:
The number of guests necessary for both venues to be equal in cost is \( n = 41 \). 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{41}
\]<|im_end|>","The total cost of the first venue can be expressed as 200 + 5*X, where X is the number of guests. Similarly, the total cost of the second venue can be expressed as 25*X.
Next we must find the value of X that makes these two costs equal. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get the equation 200 + 5*X = 25*X.
By subtracting 5*X from each side to get 200 = 20*X.
Then, X = 200/20 = 10, so when there are 10 guests the two venues will be equal in cost.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of insects each person found:

- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found.

We know from the problem that:
1. The total number of insects collected by all three is 43: 
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half as many insects as Bodhi:
   \[
   D = \frac{B}{2}
   \]

Now we can substitute these equations into the total insect equation to solve for \( B \), then find \( D \), and finally \( L \).

First, substitute \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the equation involving \( L \):
\[
L = (D + 7)
\]
Since \( D = \frac{B}{2} \), we have:
\[
L = \left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right)
\]

Next, substitute \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \) into the total insects equation:
\[
\left(\frac{B}{2} + 7\right) + \frac{B}{2} + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms on the left side:
\[
\frac{B}{2} + \frac{B}{2} + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
B + B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
3B + 7 = 43
\]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
3B = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
B = 12
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \) using \( D = \frac{B}{2} \):
\[
D = \frac{12}{2} = 6
\]

Finally, use \( L = D + 7 \) to find \( L \):
\[
L = 6 + 7 = 13
\]

So, Lily found **13** insects.<|im_end|>","Let B = the number of insects Bodhi collected

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much yarn Mariah used.
2. Determine how much yarn her grandma used.
3. Add both amounts together to find out how much yarn they used in total.
4. Convert the total amount from skeins to yards.

Step 1: Calculate how much yarn Mariah used.
Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn.

Step 2: Calculate how much yarn her grandma used.
Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn.

Step 3: Add both amounts together.
\[
\text{Total yarn used} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2}
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4.

Convert \(\frac{1}{2}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1 + 2}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

So, they used \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a skein of yarn altogether.

Step 4: Convert the total amount from skeins to yards.
Since there are 364 yards per skein, we can calculate the total number of yards as follows:
\[
\text{Total yards} = \frac{3}{4} \times 364
\]

Calculate the multiplication:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 364 = \frac{3 \times 364}{4} = \frac{1092}{4} = 273
\]

Therefore, they used **273 yards** of yarn altogether.<|im_end|>","Mariah’s grandma used 1/2 a skein of yarn. We should multiply this by (2/2) to have a common denominator, so 1/2 * 2/2 = 2/4.

3/4 of a skein of yarn * 364 yards = 364 / 4 = <<3/4*364=273>>273 yards.

To determine how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we need to break down the problem into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of gifts needed for her first group of friends.**

Cherrie has 2 friends who want 5 gifts each.
\[ \text{Total gifts for the first group} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of gifts needed for her second group of friends.**

Cherrie has 3 friends who want 2 gifts each.
\[ \text{Total gifts for the second group} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

**Step 3: Add the gifts from both groups together.**

\[ \text{Total gifts before surprises} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

**Step 4: Determine how many additional gifts Cherrie buys.**

Cherrie decides to buy 10 more gifts randomly.
\[ \text{Additional gifts} = 10 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought.**

\[ \text{Total gifts} = \text{Total gifts before surprises} + \text{Additional gifts} = 16 + 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is \(26\). The final answer is:

<|im_start|>middleware
To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the width of the rug:**
   - We know that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.
   - The chair's width is given as 3 feet.
   - Therefore, the width of the rug = Chair width + 5 feet
     \[
     \text{Width of the rug} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the length of the couch:**
   - The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.
   - First, calculate twice the width of the rug:
     \[
     2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Then, add 2 feet to this value to get the length of the couch:
     \[
     \text{Length of the couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
     \]

So, the length of the couch is \(18\) feet.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{18}\) feet.<|im_end|>","Chair = <<3=3>>3 feet

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount spent on other flavors:**
   - Suzie spent $2 on each of the 4 packs.
   - Number of packs = 4
   - Cost per pack = $2
   - Total cost (all types) = 4 * $2 = $8

2. **Calculate the cost of the green apple gum pack:**
   - Suzie paid half the price of the grape gum pack for the green apple gum.
   - Grape gum pack = $2
   - Green apple gum pack = $2 / 2 = $1

3. **Find the total amount spent on the strawberry packs:**
   - We know the total amount spent ($7).
   - Amount spent on other types = $8
   - Amount spent on strawberry packs = $7 - $8 = -$1 (which means there is an error or misunderstanding since the total spent should not be negative).

Given that the calculation leads to a negative value, it indicates that the information provided might have been incorrect or incomplete. However, based on the given data, we cannot accurately determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget and materials, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of popsicle sticks available:**
   - From the 2x4 piece of wood, Frederick gets 200 sticks.
   - From the 2x8 piece of wood, Frederick gets 400 sticks.

   Total number of sticks = 200 + 400 = 600 sticks.

2. **Determine the cost efficiency of each type of wood:**
   - Cost of 2x4 piece of wood: $4
   - Cost of 2x8 piece of wood: $6

3. **Identify which wood provides more sticks per dollar spent:**
   - For the 2x4 piece of wood, the cost per stick is $\frac{4}{2} = 2$ dollars per stick.
   - For the 2x8 piece of wood, the cost per stick is $\frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}$ or 0.75 dollars per stick.

Since the 2x4 piece of wood offers better value (2 dollars per stick) compared to the 2x8 piece of wood (0.75 dollars per stick), Frederick should use the 2x4 piece of wood to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make within his budget.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget on 2x4 pieces of wood:**
   - Since Frederick spends all his $24 on 2x4 pieces of wood, he will buy one 2x4 piece of wood.
   - The number of sticks that can be made from one 2x4 piece is 200 sticks.

Therefore, Frederick can make a maximum of 200 popsicle sticks using the cheapest lumber (the 2x4 piece of wood).

To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Each dog has 4 legs, so each dog requires 2 pairs of snowshoes (since \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pairs per dog).

Mario has 6 dogs, so he needs:
\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 2 \text{ pairs per dog} = 12 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost based on the number of pairs of snowshoes.
Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

So, the total cost for 12 pairs of snowshoes would be:
\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$144.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mario will spend on snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs is:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Janet would save by purchasing a weekly bus pass instead of taking individual bus trips, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of Janet's current bus trips:**
   - Janet takes 2 bus trips per day.
   - She does this 5 days a week.

First, calculate the number of bus trips in a week:
\[ \text{Number of trips per week} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Next, calculate the total cost of these trips at $2.20 per trip:
\[ \text{Total cost per week} = 10 \times 2.20 = 22.00 \]

So, Janet currently spends $22.00 on bus trips every week.

2. **Compare the cost of the bus pass to the cost of regular bus trips:**
   - The weekly bus pass costs $20.00.
   
3. **Calculate the savings by comparing the two options:**
   - Savings = Current Cost - Pass Cost
   \[ \text{Savings} = 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00 \]

Therefore, if Janet buys the weekly bus pass, she will save $2.00 per week.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{\$2.00}$<|im_end|>","First find the total number of trips Janet takes during the week: 2 trips/day * 5 days/week = <<2*5=10>>10 trips/week

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of cows on the farm:**
   - We know that the farm has 30 cows.

2. **Verify the information about the zoo’s cows:**
   - According to the problem, the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.
   - If the farm has 30 cows, then the zoo should have \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \) cows.
   
3. **Check if the given numbers match:**
   - Since the zoo actually has 20 sheep, not cows, there seems to be an inconsistency in the provided data. However, for consistency, we'll proceed assuming the farm indeed has 30 cows (as stated).

4. **Calculate the total number of animals at the farm:**
   - The farm has 30 cows and some unspecified amount of sheep.
   
5. **Verify the information about the zoo’s sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   
6. **Calculate the total number of animals at the zoo:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   
7. **Combine both totals to find the overall count:**
   - Farm: 30 cows + Some unspecified amount of sheep
   - Zoo: 20 sheep
   
Since we don't have enough information about the farm's sheep population, we can only combine the known elements from the zoo. 

8. **Final calculation:**

- Total number of animals at the zoo: 20 sheep.
- Combined total of animals (farm and zoo): 
\[ 30 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 50 \]

Therefore, the farm and zoo combined have **50** animals.<|im_end|>","The zoo has 2 * 30 cows = <<2*30=60>>60 cows.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought given that she bought four times as many onions and potatoes as Rose.

Step 1: Determine the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought.
Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on Rose's purchase.
Since Sophia bought four times as many onions and potatoes as Rose, we can calculate the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought by multiplying Rose's quantities by 4.

Number of onions Sophia bought = 4 * Number of onions Rose bought
Number of onions Sophia bought = 4 * 12 = 48

Number of potatoes Sophia bought = 4 * Number of potatoes Rose bought
Number of potatoes Sophia bought = 4 * 4 = 16

Step 3: Calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = Number of onions + Number of potatoes
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 48 + 16 = 64

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 64 onions and potatoes at the market.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between December 31st and July 19th.
First, let's determine the total number of days in the given time frame:

- From December 31st to January 31st: \(31\) days
- February: \(28\) days (assuming no leap year)
- March: \(31\) days
- April: \(30\) days
- May: \(31\) days
- June: \(30\) days
- July: \(19\) days

Adding these up gives us the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th:

\[31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 190\]

So, there are **190** days until Andy reaches his goal on July 19th.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 pounds.
Andy needs to burn **3500 calories per pound**, so for 30 pounds:

\[3500 \text{ calories/pound} \times 30 \text{ pounds} = 105,000 \text{ calories}\]

### Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach his goal.
Since Andy has 190 days to achieve his goal, we divide the total number of calories needed by the number of days:

\[ \frac{105,000 \text{ calories}}{190 \text{ days}} \approx 5,474.68 \text{ calories/day} \]

Therefore, Andy needs approximately **5,474.68 calories** of net calories burned each day to reach his goal.

### Conclusion
The final answer is:
{The final answer is}
\[ \boxed{5,474.68 \text{ calories/day}} \]<|im_end|>","January, March, and May have 31 days, February has 28, and April and June have 30, and Andy's birthday is on the 19th day of July. So there are 3 * 31 days + 28 + 2 * 30 days + 19 days = 93 days + 28 + 60 days + 19 days = <<3*31+28+2*30+19=200>>200 days until Andy's birthday.
He wants to lose 30 lbs. At 3500 calories per pound, this is 30 * 3500 = <<30*3500=105000>>105,000 calories total,
To reach his goal, he will have to burn 105,000 calories / 200 days = <<105000/200=525>>525 calories per day more than he consumes.

To determine how much money Gerald has left after working for an entire week and spending a total of $100, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Gerald earns in one week.
Gerald's daily pay is $30 per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, his weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$30 \times 7 \]

### Calculation:
\[ \$30 \times 7 = \$210 \]

So, Gerald earns $210 in a week.

### Step 2: Subtract the amount Gerald spent from his total earnings.
Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, subtract this amount from his total earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$210 - \$100 \]

### Calculation:
\[ \$210 - \$100 = \$110 \]

Therefore, after working for an entire week and spending $100, Gerald has **$110** left.<|im_end|>","He earns $30 daily for a week (7 days) for a total earnings of $30*7 = $<<30*7=210>>210

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert kilometers to meters**: 
   - Since 1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m), 0.25 km = 0.25 × 1000 m = 250 meters.

2. **Calculate total distance run**:
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Number of laps = 8.
   - Total distance in meters = 250 meters/lap × 8 laps = 2000 meters.

3. **Calculate the amount of water needed per kilometer**:
   - Hannah needs 60 ml of water per kilometer.

4. **Convert total distance from meters to kilometers**:
   - Total distance in kilometers = 2000 meters / 1000 meters/kilometer = 2 km.

5. **Calculate total water required**:
   - Water needed per kilometer = 60 ml.
   - Total water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km = 120 ml.

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink **120 ml** of water.<|im_end|>","First find the total number of kilometers Hannah runs: 8 laps * .25 km/lap = <<8*.25=2>>2 km

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down Julie's spending into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate how much Julie spent on clothes.
Julie started with $500. She spent 20% of her money on clothes.
- First, we calculate 20% of $500:
\[
0.20 \times 500 = 100
\]
So, Julie spent $100 on clothes.

### Step 2: Determine how much money was left after buying clothes.
After spending $100 on clothes, the remaining amount is:
\[
500 - 100 = 400
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much Julie spent on CDs.
Next, she spends 25% of the remaining money ($400) on CDs.
- We calculate 25% of $400:
\[
0.25 \times 400 = 100
\]
So, Julie spent $100 on CDs.

### Step 4: Determine how much money was left after buying CDs.
After spending $100 on CDs, the remaining amount is:
\[
400 - 100 = 300
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
{The final answer is} $300.<|im_end|>","Julie spend $500 * 0.2 = $<<500*0.2=100>>100 for clothes.

She spend $400 * 0.25 = $<<400*0.25=100>>100 on CDs.
Julie had $400 - $100 = $<<400-100=300>>300 left.

                    question:
                    ? A house and : a lot cost $120,000. ; If the house cost three times as much as the lot, how much did the house cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of both the house and the lot based on the given information.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( H \) represent the cost of the house.
Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot.

Given that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

We are also informed that the house costs three times as much as the lot:

\[ H = 3L \]

### Step 2: Substitute into Total Cost Equation
Substitute \( H = 3L \) into the first equation:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

### Step 3: Solve for Lot Cost (\( L \))
Divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

So, the lot costs $30,000.

### Step 4: Calculate House Cost (\( H \))
Now substitute \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The house cost } \$90,000}
\]<|im_end|>","Since the house costs 3 times as much as the lot, the ratio of lot price to the house price is 1 : 3. This also means 1/4 of the cost is for the lot and 3/4 of the cost is for the house.
The cost of the house is 3/4 of the total cost, which is $120,000. 3/4 * $120,000 = $<<3/4*120000=90000>>90,000.

To calculate Tara's profit from selling the canvas bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of buying the canvas bags:**
   - Tara bought 8 packs.
   - Each pack costs $4.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Packs} \times \text{Cost per Pack}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 8 \times 4 = \$32
\]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags:**
   - Tara sells each bag for $8.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Bags Sold} \times \text{Price per Bag}
\]

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 8 \times 8 = \$64
\]

3. **Determine the profit:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = \$64 - \$32 = \$32

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many punches Joe threw in total during the fight, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of minutes in one round.
2. Determine the number of minutes for all rounds combined.
3. Multiply the total number of minutes by Joe's average punch rate.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of minutes in one round**

Each round lasts 3 minutes.

**Step 2: Determine the number of minutes for all rounds combined**

Since there are 5 rounds, we multiply the duration of one round by the number of rounds:
\[ \text{Total minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes/round} \times 5 \text{ rounds} \]

**Step 3: Multiply the total number of minutes by Joe's average punch rate**

Joe throws an average of 0.25 punches per minute. We now calculate the total number of punches:
\[ \text{Total punches} = \text{Total minutes} \times \text{Average punches per minute} \]
\[ \text{Total punches} = (3 \times 5) \times 0.25 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total minutes} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total punches} = 15 \times 0.25 = 3.75
\]

Therefore, Joe threw **3.75 punches** on average throughout the entire fight.<|im_end|>","The fight lasted 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 minutes

2. Use the information about Kelsie's cookies compared to Josh's cookies to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine how many cookies Josh made

We know that Suzanne made 36 cookies. According to the problem, Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made.

So, let's calculate how many cookies Josh made:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{\text{Cookies made by Suzanne}}{4} \]

Substituting the number of cookies Suzanne made:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies Kelsie made

According to the problem, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.

So, let's calculate how many cookies Kelsie made:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times (\text{Cookies made by Josh}) \]

Substituting the number of cookies Josh made:
\[ \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made **18** cookies.<|im_end|>","Josh made 36/4=<<36/4=9>>9 cookies

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Ali initially has:**
   - Ali has four $10 bills, so the total from these is \(4 \times \$10 = \$40\).
   - Ali also has six $20 bills, so the total from these is \(6 \times \$20 = \$120\).

2. **Add the amounts together to find the initial total:**
   - Initial total money = \$40 (from $10 bills) + \$120 (from $20 bills) = \$160.

3. **Determine how much money Ali gives to her sister:**
   - Ali gives her sister half of the total money she has, which means she gives away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \$160 = \$80\).

4. **Subtract the amount given to her sister from the initial total to find out how much money she has left:**
   - Money left after giving to her sister = \$160 - \$80 = \$80.

5. **Calculate how much money Ali spends on dinner:**
   - Ali spends \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining money on dinner, so the cost of dinner is \(\frac{3}{5} \times \$80 = \$48\).

6. **Subtract the cost of dinner from the money left after giving to her sister to find out how much money she has after buying dinner:**
   - Money left after buying dinner = \$80 - \$48 = \$32.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is $\boxed{\$32}$.{The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Four $10 bills have a value of 4*$10 =$<<4*10=40>>40

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Royce takes to shingle a house given that he takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob.

1. **Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes:**
   Rob takes 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this as follows:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}

2. **Calculate double the time it takes Rob:**
   Double the time it takes Rob is:
   \[
   2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Add the extra 40 minutes to the doubled time:**
   Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob. Therefore:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy, we'll calculate the total number of items required for each grandchild and then multiply that by the number of grandchildren.

1. **Calculate the total number of items needed:**
   - Hats: Each grandchild requires one hat.
     Number of hats = 3 (since there are three grandchildren).
   
   - Scarves: Each grandchild requires one scarf.
     Number of scarves = 3
   
   - Sweaters: Each grandchild requires one sweater.
     Number of sweaters = 3
   
   - Mittens: Each grandchild requires two pairs of mittens.
     Number of mitten sets per grandchild = 2
     Total number of mittens = 3 grandchildren * 2 mittens/child = 6 mittens
   
   - Socks: Each grandchild requires two pairs of socks.
     Number of sock sets per grandchild = 2
     Total number of socks = 3 grandchildren * 2 socks/child = 6 socks

2. **Sum up the total number of items:**
   \[
   \text{Total items} = \text{Hats} + \text{Scarves} + \text{Sweaters} + \text{Mittens} + \text{Socks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total items} = 3 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine the number of skeins needed:**
   - Each item requires 2 skeins of wool.
   - Total number of items = 21
   \[
   \text{Total skeins needed} = \frac{\text{Total items}}{\text{Items per skein}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total skeins needed} = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5
   \]

Since Martha cannot purchase half a skein, she would need to round up to ensure she has enough wool:

\[
\text{Final number of skeins needed} = \lceil 10.5 \rceil = 11
\]

Therefore, Martha will need to buy 11 skeins of wool to cover all the items for her grandchildren. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.

                    The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning. They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves : in the ; afternoon. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. How many ! loaves of bread did they have ? left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many loaves of bread were left, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loaves baked.
2. Subtract the number of loaves sold during the day.
3. Subtract the number of loaves returned.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Loaves Baked
The bakeries started with 200 loaves of bread.

\[ \text{Total loaves baked} = 200 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Sold Loaves
They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon.

First, let's calculate the total number of loaves sold:

\[ \text{Loaves sold} = 93 + 39 \]

Perform the addition:

\[ 93 + 39 = 132 \]

Now subtract the total number of loaves sold from the initial number of loaves baked:

\[ \text{Loaves remaining after sales} = 200 - 132 \]

Subtract:

\[ 200 - 132 = 68 \]

So, there are **68** loaves remaining after selling them.

### Step 3: Subtract the Returned Loaves
A grocery store returned 6 loaves that were unsold.

We now subtract the number of returned loaves from the remaining loaves:

\[ \text{Loaves left} = 68 - 6 \]

Subtract:

\[ 68 - 6 = 62 \]

Therefore, the final number of loaves left is:

\[
\boxed{62}
\]<|im_end|>","The Bakery sold 93 + 39 = <<93+39=132>>132 loaves.
The Bakery made 200 loaves and sold 132, leaving 200 - 132 = <<200-132=68>>68 loaves remaining.
The grocery store returned 6 loaves, so there were 6 + 68 = <<6+68=74>>74 loaves left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many rows of flowers Jackson can plant, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of rows of red tulips.
2. Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips.
3. Add the two numbers together to get the total number of rows.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of rows of red tulips**

Jackson has 36 red tulips and each row contains 6 red tulips. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \text{Number of rows of red tulips} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of rows of blue tulips**

Jackson has 24 blue tulips and each row contains 8 blue tulips. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of tulips per row:

\[ \text{Number of rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \]

**Step 3: Add the two numbers together**

Now that we have the number of rows for both types of tulips, we add them together:

\[ \text{Total number of rows} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jackson will be able to plant **9 rows of flowers**. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]<|im_end|>","First, divide the number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row: 36 / 6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows.

                    question:
                    Heather bought a jumbo bag of raisins with 27 cups of raisins in it. She wants to make oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix with the raisins. ?

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of batches Heather can make from the raisins:**
   - First, determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make.
   - Then, divide the remaining raisins equally between granola and snack mix.

Let's start with calculating the number of batches of oatmeal cookies:

- Each batch of oatmeal cookies requires \( \frac{3}{4} \) cup of raisins.
- The total amount of raisins available is 27 cups.

\[
\text{Number of batches of oatmeal cookies} = \left( \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup per batch}} \right)
\]

First, simplify the division:

\[
\frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}} = 27 \times \frac{4}{3} = 36
\]

So, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies.

Next, let's calculate how much raisins will be left after making the oatmeal cookies:

- Total raisins initially: 27 cups
- Raisins used for oatmeal cookies: \( 36 \times \frac{3}{4} = 27 \text{ cups} \)

Now, subtract the used raisins from the initial total:

\[
27 \text{ cups} - 27 \text{ cups} = 0 \text{ cups}
\]

Since there are no raisins left, all the raisins have been used up in making the oatmeal cookies.

Therefore, Heather cannot make any more batches of oatmeal cookies because she has already used all her raisins.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is} There are no additional batches of oatmeal cookies that Heather can make with the remaining raisins.<|im_end|>","Heather will have 27 / 3 = <<27/3=9>>9 cups of raisins for oatmeal cookies after dividing the bag.

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Ada's daily electric consumption ! is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add , a device that will consume ? 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before . and after she adds the new device?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the difference in Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Ada's current monthly electricity consumption.
Ada consumes 12 kilowatts (kW) per hour.

- **Daily consumption**: \( 12 \text{ kW/hour} \)
- **Number of days in a month** (for simplicity, let's assume 30 days): \( 30 \)

\[
\text{Current monthly consumption} = 12 \text{ kW/hour} \times 30 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month}
\]

\[
= 12 \times 30 \times 30
\]
\[
= 12 \times 900
\]
\[
= 10800 \text{ kWh/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of Ada's current monthly electricity bill.
Given that one kilowatt-hour (kWh) costs $1.50.

\[
\text{Cost per kWh} = \$1.50
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 10800 kWh} = 10800 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh}
\]

\[
= 10800 \times 1.50
\]
\[
= 16200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new monthly electricity consumption after adding the device.
The new device consumes 2 kW per hour.

- **New daily consumption**: \( 2 \text{ kW/hour} \)
- **Number of days in a month**: Same as above (30 days)

\[
\text{New monthly consumption} = 2 \text{ kW/hour} \times 30 \text{ hours/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month}
\]

\[
= 2 \times 30 \times 30
\]
\[
= 2 \times 900
\]
\[
= 1800 \text{ kWh/month}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the new monthly electricity bill.
\[
\text{New total cost for 1800 kWh} = 1800 \text{ kWh} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh}
\]

\[
= 1800 \times 1.50
\]
\[
= 2700 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in Ada's monthly electricity bill.
\[
\text{Difference in monthly bill} = \text{Current monthly bill} - \text{New monthly bill}
\]

\[
= 16200 \text{ dollars} - 2700 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
= 13500 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion:
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after adding the new device is **$13,500**.<|im_end|>","Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.
So, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.
Ada's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.
So her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.
Ada's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147
Therefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for five people to paint a whole house given that one person can paint half a house in five days.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the rate at which one person paints:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, one person paints \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a house per day.

2. **Calculate the total work done by one person over the entire time period (5 days):**
   - In 5 days, one person will paint \( 5 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2.5 \) houses.

3. **Understand the combined effect when five people work together:**
   - When working together, all five people effectively double their individual productivity because they share resources and expertise.

4. **Calculate the effective painting capacity of five people:**
   - Since five people have the same productive capability as one person but working simultaneously, five people together will be able to paint 2.5 houses in 5 days.

5. **Determine the number of houses painted per day by five people:**
   - Since five people together can paint 2.5 houses in 5 days, they will paint \( \frac{2.5}{5} = 0.5 \) houses per day.

6. **Find out how long it takes for five people to paint one house:**
   - To find out how long it takes for five people to paint one house, divide the total number of houses they can paint per day by the number of houses needed to complete one full job.
     \[
     \text{Time taken to paint one house} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{0.5 \text{ houses/day}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time taken to paint one house} = 2 \text{ days}
     \]

7. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - So, if it takes 2 days for five people to paint one house, then:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = 2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, it would take five people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 48 hours.<|im_end|>","First, we need to determine how many days it takes 1 person to paint a whole house. We do this by performing 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 days to paint the full house.
Since five people would perform the task 5 times as fast, we find the total amount of time required by performing 10/5= <<10/5=2>>2 days to paint the full house.
Since there are 24 hours in a day, we perform 24*2=<<24*2=48>>48 hours for them to paint the full house.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.

2. **Calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has:**
   - Since Ophelia has 20 sofas and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can set up an equation to find the number of chairs she has.
     Let \( C_O \) be the number of chairs Ophelia has.
     \[
     C_O = C_S + 2
     \]
     where \( C_S \) is the number of sofas Ophelia has (which is 20).
     Substituting the value of \( C_S \):
     \[
     C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of chairs Jenna has:**
   - Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
     So, if \( C_J \) is the number of chairs Jenna has,
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times C_O
     \]
     We already found \( C_O \) to be 22.
     Therefore,
     \[
     C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66
     \]

4. **Summarize the number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Ophelia has 20 sofas.
   - Ophelia has 22 chairs.
   - Jenna has 66 chairs.

5. **Calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:**
   - Total number of sofas:
     \[
     T_{sofas} = 20 + 22 = 42
     \]
   - Total number of chairs:
     \[
     T_{chairs} = 22 + 66 = 88
     \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is:
\[
T_{total} = T_{sofas} + T_{chairs} = 42 + 88 = 130
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 130.<|im_end|>","If Ophelia has 20 sofas and 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, a total of 3*22 = <<3*22=66>>66 chairs
The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 66+22 = <<66+22=88>>88
Since Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the total number of sofas she has is 66-2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.
The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is 64+20 = <<64+20=84>>84 sofas

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cost per CD:**
   - Tom bought one CD for $4.
   - He also bought a headphone set for $48 in total.
   - To find out how much each CD costs, we divide the total amount spent on both items by the number of CDs purchased.

2. **Calculate the cost per CD:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per CD} = \frac{\$48}{\text{Number of CDs}} = \frac{\$48}{1} = \$48
   \]

3. **Find out how many CDs Tom could have bought without buying the headphone set:**
   - Since each CD costs $4, we need to divide the total amount spent ($48) by the cost per CD ($4).
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs without headphone set} = \frac{\$48}{\$4} = 12
   \]

4. **Compare the number of CDs Tom could have bought before and after purchasing the headphone set:**
   - If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he could have bought 12 CDs.
   - If he did buy the headphone set, he can only buy 1 CD (since he already has one).

5. **Calculate the difference in the number of CDs:**
   - The difference in the number of CDs is calculated by subtracting the number of CDs he can now afford from the maximum number of CDs he could have bought.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 11.<|im_end|>","The headphone set cost was 48 - 4 = $<<48-4=44>>44.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break down Josh's workouts into different periods and sum up the total hours over the 8-week period.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the total hours per week:**
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours per week.
   - However, there were some instances where he didn't work out at all or worked more than 4 hours.

2. **Determine the duration of the non-workout weeks:**
   - We know that Josh spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
     - This means he skipped 3 weeks (since \(8 - 2 = 6\) weeks).
   - He also spent 6 hours in one week.
     - This indicates he skipped 7 weeks (since \(8 - 1 = 7\) weeks).

3. **Calculate the number of full weeks Josh actually worked out:**
   - Since he skipped 9 weeks in total (6 + 1), he worked out during these weeks.
   - The remaining 8 weeks minus the 9 weeks skipped equals zero, which confirms he worked out exactly 8 weeks.

4. **Sum up the hours spent working out:**
   - Each week, he spends 4 hours working out.
   - Over 8 weeks, he would have spent \(8 \times 4 = 32\) hours if he worked out every week.

However, since he skipped 9 weeks, he effectively worked out only 8 weeks.

Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is **32** hours.<|im_end|>","For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each for a total of 5*2 = <<5*2=10>>10 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of passengers getting off in the first stop.
- Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off.

So, after the first stop:
\[ \text{Passengers remaining} = 48 - 8 = 40 \]

### Step 2: Calculate how many passengers enter the bus at the first stop.
- According to the problem, 5 times as many people as those who got off from the bus get onto the bus.
- Since 8 passengers got off, 5 times that amount would be:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
So, 40 more people board the bus.

Thus, after the first stop:
\[ \text{Total passengers} = 40 + 40 = 80 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of passengers getting off in the second stop.
- After the first stop, there are now 80 people on the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off.

So, after the second stop:
\[ \text{Passengers remaining} = 80 - 21 = 59 \]

### Conclusion
After the second stop, there are **59** passengers on the bus.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{59}
\]<|im_end|>","At the first stop, 5 * 8 = <<5*8=40>>40 passengers get on the bus.

At the second stop, 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 passengers get on the bus.
After the second stop there are ( 80 - 21 ) + 7 = <<80-21+7=66>>66 passengers.

                    question:
                    Jame will turn : 27 : in 5 years.  In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  How many years separate the age ! of the two now?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years apart Jame's and his cousin's ages will be in the future.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jame’s current age.
   - Let \( C \) represent his cousin's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   - According to the first piece of information, in 5 years Jame will be 27 years old. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     J + 5 = 27
     \]
   
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]

3. **Determine the Cousin's Age:**
   - The second piece of information states that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. First, calculate twice Jame's age (which is currently 22):
     \[
     2 \times 22 = 44
     \]
   - Then, subtract 5 from this value to find the cousin's age in 8 years:
     \[
     44 - 5 = 39
     \]

4. **Calculate the Current Ages:**
   - Since the cousin will be 39 in 8 years, his current age must be:
     \[
     C = 39 - 8 = 31
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Years Between Their Ages:**
   - To find out how many years separate their ages, we use their ages at any point in time. For simplicity, let's consider their ages when they are both young enough to compare accurately. If we assume they were the same age right after the given conditions were met, then the difference would be:
     \[
     |J - C| = |22 - 31| = 9
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of years separating their ages is:
     \[
     \boxed{9}
     \]<|im_end|>","James is 27-5=<<27-5=22>>22 years old

So his cousin is 55-8=<<55-8=47>>47 years old now
So there is a 47-22=<<47-22=25>>25 year gap

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. He paid $400 less for the printer than ; the computer. If the computer cost $1,100, how much did , one monitor cost, in dollars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of the computer.
Errol spent $2,400 on the computer.

### Step 2: Calculate the price difference between the computer and the printer.
He paid $400 less for the printer than he did for the computer.

Let \( C \) be the cost of the computer. Given that \( C = \$1,100 \).

Therefore, the cost of the printer \( P \) can be calculated as:
\[ P = C - 400 \]
Substituting \( C \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 \]
\[ P = 700 \]

So, the printer costs $700.

### Step 3: Find out the total amount spent on the monitors.
Since the total amount spent was $2,400 and we know the costs of the computer and the printer, the remaining amount must have been spent on the two monitors.

Total cost spent on the computer and printer:
\[ Computer + Printer = \$2,400 \]
Given:
\[ Computer = \$1,100 \]
\[ Printer = \$700 \]
We subtract these from the total to find the cost of the monitors:
\[ Monitors = Total - (Computer + Printer) \]
Substitute the values:
\[ Monitors = 2400 - (1100 + 700) \]
\[ Monitors = 2400 - 1800 \]
\[ Monitors = 600 \]

So, the total cost for both monitors combined is $600.

### Step 4: Determine the individual cost of one monitor.
Since there are two monitors, we divide the total cost by 2 to get the cost per monitor.

Cost per monitor:
\[ Cost_{per\ monitor} = \frac{Monitors}{2} \]
Substitute the value:
\[ Cost_{per\ monitor} = \frac{600}{2} \]
\[ Cost_{per\ monitor} = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is **$300**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The cost of one monitor is **$300**.<|im_end|>","He paid 1100-400=<<1100-400=700>>700 for the printer.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of participants:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.

2. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
   - They were divided into two equal groups.
   - Number of girls = Number of boys = \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - Total seashells from boys = \( 10 \times 60 = 600 \).

4. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times that amount.
   - Let \( G \) be the total number of seashells brought by each girl.
   - Then, \( G = 600 + 4 \times 600 \).
     \[
     G = 600 + 2400 = 3000
     \]

5. **Verify the total number of seashells:**
   - Sum of seashells brought by all children (boys and girls):
     \[
     600 \text{ (boys)} + 3000 \text{ (girls)} = 3600
     \]
   - This matches the total number of seashells if we consider each group separately.

Therefore, each girl brought 3000 seashells.

**Final Answer:**

\[
\boxed{\text{Each girl brought 3000 seashells}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine George's original number of candies:**
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George originally had.
   - According to the problem, George now has 3 candies left after eating 5.

2. **Set up an equation for George's remaining candies:**
   - If George eats 5 candies from his original amount \( G \), he will have \( G - 5 = 3 \).

3. **Solve for \( G \):**
   \[
   G - 5 = 3 \\
   G = 8
   \]
   So, George originally had 8 candies.

4. **Calculate Nick's initial number of candies:**
   - The problem states that Nick had twice as many candies as George initially.
   - Therefore, Nick initially had \( 2 \times G = 2 \times 8 = 16 \) candies.

To find the total thickness of the four books, we need to determine the thickness of each book individually based on the given information and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **First Book:**
   - Thickness = 31 mm (given)

2. **Second Book:**
   - Thickness = 50 mm (given)

3. **Third Book:**
   - Third book is described as ""5 mm less thick than the second book.""
     - Let's denote the thickness of the third book as \( T_3 \).
     - Therefore, \( T_3 = 50 - 5 = 45 \) mm.

4. **Fourth Book:**
   - Fourth book is described as ""twice as thick as the first book.""
     - Let's denote the thickness of the fourth book as \( T_4 \).

To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to create to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of vlogs made so far.
- First week: 18 vlogs
- Second week: 21 vlogs
- Third week: 15 vlogs

Total vlogs made = 18 + 21 + 15

Let's calculate this sum:

\[
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \text{ vlogs}
\]

So, Emma has already made 54 vlogs.

### Step 2: Determine the remaining number of vlogs needed.
Emma aims to make 72 vlogs in total. We subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

Remaining vlogs = 72 - 54

Now let's perform this subtraction:

\[
72 - 54 = 18 \text{ vlogs}

2. **Calculate the tip percentage**: Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% as a tip.

3. **Calculate the tip amount**: To find the tip amount, we need to calculate 20% of the total bill.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1) First, let's find out how much each boy initially gets.
   Total = $18
   Number of boys = 3
   So, each boy's initial share = $18 / 3 = $6.

2) Now, we need to calculate what the eldest boy ends up with after adding $5 and then spending $8.
   His initial share: $6
   Adding $5: $6 + $5 = $11
   Spending $8: $11 - $8 = $3

3) Next, we'll figure out what the total amount he has left after saving some more.
   We know he can triple whatever he has left after spending $8,
   so before spending that $8, he must have had half of what he ended up with in step 2.
   Half of $3 (what he had left after spending $8) = $3 / 2 = $1.5

4) Finally, we add this additional amount back into what he saved ($1.5).
   So, he saved an extra $1.5, making his total = $1.5 + $1.5 = $3.

Since there are 30 days in April, the second half would be from the 16th to the end of the month (i.e., 16 to 30).

### Step 4: Calculate the number of days in the first half of April.
This would be from the 1st to the 15th.

### Step 5: Set up an equation based on the given information.
Let \( x \) represent the amount Elvis saves daily in the first half of April.

- The total savings in the first half would then be \( 15x \).
- For the second half, since he wants to save twice as much daily, he will save \( 2x \) per day.

### Step 6: Write the equation that represents the total savings over both halves of April.
\[ 15x + 2x = 1125 \]

### Step 7: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ 17x = 1125 \]

### Step 8: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides by 17:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{17} \]
\[ x = 66.17647059\ldots \]

### Step 9: Round to two decimal places.
For practical purposes, we can round \( x \) to:
\[ x \approx 66.18 \]

### Final Answer:
Elvis needs to save approximately **$66.18** each day in the second half of April.<|im_end|>","Let the amount he has to save for each day of the second half of April be y
Since y is twice as much what he saved in each day of the first half, he saved y/2 in each day of the first half
April has 30 days, 15 days in each half, so he is saving (15*(y/2)) in the 1st half, (15*y) in the 2nd half to give (15*(y/2))+(15*y)=$1125
Solving the equation gives 15(3y/2) = $1125
45y/2 = $1125
y = $1125*(2/45)
y = $<<50=50>>50

                    question:
                    Verna loves to eat fruit. She bought three apples at $1.50 each, five oranges at . $0.80 each, and six peaches at $0.75 each.  If she gave $20, how much change did she receive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the apples:**
   - Each apple costs $1.50.
   - Verna bought 3 apples.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the oranges:**
   - Each orange costs $0.80.
   - Verna bought 5 oranges.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of oranges} = 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the peaches:**
   - Each peach costs $0.75.
   - Verna bought 6 peaches.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of peaches} = 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
   \]

4. **Add up all the individual costs to find the total amount spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 4.50 (\text{apples}) + 4.00 (\text{oranges}) + 4.50 (\text{peaches})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
   \]

5. **Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount given (which was $20):**
   \[
   \text{Change received} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}. The change Verna receives after her purchase is $7.00.<|im_end|>","Three apples cost 3 x $1.50 = $<<3*1.5=4.50>>4.50.
Five oranges cost 5 x $0.80 = $<<5*0.8=4>>4.

Thus, Verna paid a total of $4.50 +$4+ $4.50 = $<<4.5+4+4.5=13>>13.
Therefore, Verna received $20 - $13 = $<<20-13=7>>7.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount each person earns for completing their respective number of tasks and then find the difference between these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Jairus's earnings
- Each task gives Jairus $0.8.
- Jairus completed 20 tasks.

\[
Jairus's earnings = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Amount per task}
\]

\[
Jairus's earnings = 20 \times 0.8
\]

\[
Jairus's earnings = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Jenny's earnings
- Each task gives Jenny $0.5.
- Jenny also completed 20 tasks.

\[
Jenny's earnings = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Amount per task}
\]

\[
Jenny's earnings = 20 \times 0.5
\]

\[
Jenny's earnings = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference in earnings
Now, subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[
\text{Difference} = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion
Jairus will earn $6 more than Jenny after finishing 20 tasks.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 6}<|im_end|>","The difference of the amount received by Jairus and Jenny is $0.8/task - $0.5/task = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3/task.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( J \) represent the amount of money Jeff receives.
Let \( B \) represent the amount of money Brad receives.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement
According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 4B \]

We also know that the total amount of money between them is $100. Therefore:
\[ J + B = 100 \]

### Step 3: Substitute and Solve for One Variable
From the first equation, we can express \( J \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ J = 4B \]

Substitute \( J \) in the second equation:
\[ 4B + B = 100 \]
\[ 5B = 100 \]

Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} \]
\[ B = 20 \]

### Step 4: Find Jeff’s Amount
Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( J \):
\[ J = 4B \]
\[ J = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ J = 80 \]

To determine how many miles Jeff walks in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Jeff walks one way.
2. Determine the round trip distance for one day's work.
3. Multiply that by the number of days he works in a week.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Jeff walks one way.
Jeff walks 3 miles one way (to his workplace).

Step 2: Determine the round trip distance for one day's work.
Since he walks both ways each day, we double the one-way distance.
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Step 3: Multiply the round trip distance by the number of working days in a week.
Jeff works 5 times a week.
\[ \text{Total distance walked in a week} = 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week} \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Elise writes '! it' in full twice:**
   - The word '!' is 1 letter.
   - 'it' is 2 letters.
   - Total for this part: \(1 + 2 = 3\) letters.

2. **Elise writes '.' half of its letters once:**
   - The word '.' is 1 letter.
   - Half of this (i.e., one quarter) would be \(\frac{1}{4}\) of 1 letter, which simplifies to approximately 0.25 letters.
   - Since she only writes this once, she writes 0.25 letters.

3. **Elise rewrites all that she has already written:**
   - From the first two parts, she wrote a total of \(3 + 0.25 = 3.25\) letters.

Therefore, the final number of letters Elise has written is \(3.25\).

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Call**: Ali makes the first call.
2. **Second Round**: After the initial call, each of the three families made by Ali will make another call. So, we have \(3\) new families added in the second round.
   - Total: \(1 + 3 = 4\) families (Ali and his three children).

3. **Third Round**: In the third round, each of these \(4\) families will make another call. So, we have \(4 \times 3 = 12\) additional families added.
   - Total: \(4 + 12 = 16\) families (including Ali and his four grandchildren).

4. **Fourth Round**: In the fourth round, each of these \(16\) families will make another call. However, only those who haven't been called before will do so. The total number of families that can be called in the fourth round is equal to the number of families that were not called in the previous rounds.
   - Since every family has already been called once in the first round, no further calls can be made in the fourth round.

Therefore, during the fourth round of calls, only the original \(4\) families (the ones called initially) will be notified.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how much Mark lost over the entire period.
Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.

\[ \text{Total loss} = 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount Mark lost.
\[
10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total loss from his final weight to find his initial weight.
Mark's final weight was 70 pounds.

Let \( W \) be his initial weight. Then,

\[ W - 30 = 70 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( W \).
Add 30 to both sides of the equation:

\[
W = 70 + 30

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many toys are needed for a play set that is five times larger than James's play set:**

   - James has 80 toys.
   - A play set needs five times as many toys as James's.

\[
5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
\]

So, a play set needs 400 toys.

2. **Calculate how many more toys Jonathan needs beyond what he currently has:**

   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach his goal.

\[
2 \text{ toys} > 0 \text{ toys (he doesn't need any)}
\]

This part seems contradictory because if he needs 2 more toys, then he must have fewer than 2 toys now. Let’s correct this:

- The correct calculation should be based on the fact that he needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach the total number needed for the play set.

3. **Set up an equation to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has:**

Let \( x \) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

According to the problem, he needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach the total number of toys needed for the play set:

\[
x + 2 = 400
\]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**

Subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[
x = 400 - 2
\]
\[
x = 398

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost before any discounts.
- **Notebooks**: Each notebook costs $1.50. With five notebooks, the total cost for notebooks is \(5 \times \$1.50 = \$7.50\).
- **Pens**: Each pen costs $0.25. With two pens, the total cost for pens is \(2 \times \$0.25 = \$0.50\).
- **Calculator**: The calculator costs $12.00.
- **Geometry Set**: The geometry set costs $10.00.

So far, the total cost before any discounts is calculated as follows:
\[ \$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

### Step 2: Apply the 10% discount.
A 10% discount means that Daniel will pay only 90% of the total cost. Therefore, we calculate 90% of the total cost.

Let's perform the calculation:
\[ \$30.00 \times 0.90 = \$27.00 \]

### Final Answer:
Daniel has to spend $\boxed{27.00}$ on all the items he wants to buy after applying the 10% discount.<|im_end|>","Five notebooks cost $5 x 1.50 = $<<5*1.50=7.50>>7.50

The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 =$<<7.5+0.5+12+10=30>>30.
Thus, total discount is 10/100 x $30 = $<<10/100*30=3>>3.
Therefore, Daniel has to spend $30 - $3 = $<<30-3=27>>27 on all the items he wants to buy.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To calculate the total amount of money Antonella earned from selling goods worth $2500 at a commission-based salary system, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the base commission for sales worth $2500**:
   - The standard commission rate is 30%.
   - Therefore, the base commission = $2500 * 0.30 = $750.

2. **Add the extra commission for any sales above $1000**:
   - Since the total sales are $2500, which is more than $1000, there will be an additional 10% commission on top of the standard 30%.
   - Additional commission rate: 10%
   - Amount exceeding $1000 = $2500 - $1000 = $1500
   - Therefore, the additional commission = $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

3. **Sum up both commissions**:
   - Base commission + Additional commission = Total commission
   - Total commission = $750 (base) + $150 (additional) = $900.

Therefore, the total amount of money Antonella earned is $900. 

{The final answer is} $900.<|im_end|>","Since Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods, she got the first 30% commission, which is 30/100*$1000 = $<<30/100*1000=300>>300
Since goods worth over $1000 earn you a 10% commission, she was entitled to earn an additional 10% commission per $500 on $2500-$1000 = $1500 worth of goods.
This amounts to $1500 * 10% = $<<1500*10*.01=150>>150
In total, Antonella earned $300 from the first commission and $150 from the second commission for a total of $150 + $300 = $<<300+150=450>>450

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many additional water bottles Bill needs to buy, let's break down the problem into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of water bottles Bill initially has:**
   - Bill starts with 2 cases.
   - Each case contains 24 bottles.
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles in 2 cases = \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \) bottles.

2. **Determine the total number of guests expected at the party:**
   - There are 70 guests.

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed if each guest gets 2 bottles:**
   - If each guest gets 2 bottles, then for 70 guests, the total number of bottles needed = \( 70 \times 2 = 140 \) bottles.

4. **Subtract the initial number of bottles from the total number needed to find out how many more bottles Bill must purchase:**
   - Total bottles needed = 140 bottles.
   - Initial bottles = 48 bottles.
   - Additional bottles needed = \( 140 - 48 = 92 \) bottles.

Therefore, Bill will need to buy **92 additional water bottles**.<|im_end|>","Bill has 2 cases of 24 bottles each, so he has 24 * 2 = <<2*24=48>>48 bottles of water
Bill needs enough water for 70 guests to have 2 bottles each, so he needs 70+70 = <<70+70=140>>140 bottles of water.
Bill needs 140 bottles of water and has 48, so he needs to buy 140- 48 = <<140-48=92>>92 bottles of water.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the time Ray takes to swim a mile on a warm day.**

- The base time for swimming a mile when the water is warm is 2 minutes more than twice as long.
- Twice as long as 16 minutes (cold day) is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Therefore, the warm day time is \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time Ray takes to swim 3 miles on both days.**

- Time for 3 miles on a cold day:
  - Since he swims at the same speed regardless of temperature, we can use his average time for one mile.
  - Average time per mile is \(\frac{16}{2} = 8\) minutes (since \(16/2 = 8\)).
  - Total time for 3 miles is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) minutes.

- Time for 3 miles on a warm day:
  - Again using his average time per mile,
  - Total time for 3 miles is \(3 \times 8 = 24\) minutes.

**Step 3: Calculate how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day.**

- Difference in time:
  - Warm day time - Cold day time = \(24 - 24 = 0\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes **no additional time** to swim 3 miles on a warm day compared to a cold day.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is} 0 minutes.<|im_end|>","Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes

To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours per day.

\[
\text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked}
\]

\[
\text{Daily Earnings} = \$2 \times 5 = \$10

2. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 5 hours per day for 4 days in a week.

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days Per Week}
\]

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \$10 \times 4 = \$40

3. **Determine how many weeks it takes for John to reach his savings goal:**
   - John aims to save $80.

\[
\text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}}

To determine how much it costs to have lunch at Subway, we need to calculate the cost of both subs separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the foot-long fish sub:**
   - The given price for the foot-long fish sub is $40.
   
2. **Calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:**
   - It's stated that this sub costs ""thrice as much"" as the foot-long fish sub.
   - Thrice as much means 3 times the amount of the foot-long fish sub.
   - Therefore, the cost for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub = $40 * 3 = $120.

Now, let's add these two amounts together:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of buttons:**
   The bag contains 21 buttons.

2. **Identify how many buttons have two holes:**
   Seven buttons have two holes.

3. **Calculate the number of buttons that have four holes:**
   Since there are 21 buttons in total and seven of them have two holes, we can find out how many have four holes by subtracting the number of buttons with two holes from the total number of buttons.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = \text{Total number of buttons} - \text{Number of buttons with two holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of holes:**
   We know that seven buttons have two holes each, so these contribute \(7 \times 2\) holes.
   Similarly, fourteen buttons have four holes each, contributing \(14 \times 4\) holes.
   
   \[
   \text{Total number of holes} = (\text{Number of buttons with two holes} \times \text{Holes per button}) + (\text{Number of buttons with four holes} \times \text{Holes per button})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of holes} = (7 \times 2) + (14 \times 4)

To solve this problem, we need to determine the volume of Peter's locker based on the volumes of Timothy's and Zack's lockers.

**Step 1: Determine the volume of Zack's locker**
- We know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker.
- Timothy's locker volume = 24 cubic inches.
- Therefore, Zack's locker volume = \(\frac{24}{2} = 12\) cubic inches.

**Step 2: Determine the volume of Peter's locker**
- We know that Peter's locker is one-fourth the size of Zack's locker.
- Zack's locker volume = 12 cubic inches.
- Therefore, Peter's locker volume = \(12 \times \frac{1}{4}\).

**Step 3: Calculate the volume of Peter's locker**

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Daily Recommended Coffee Intake
Let's denote the daily recommended number of cups of coffee as \( R \).

Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount, we can write:
\[ \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Juan's Current Coffee Intake
Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks. So, we can express Juan's current coffee intake as:
\[ \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \]

### Step 3: Find the Reduction Needed
Juan's doctor recommends reducing his coffee intake to the daily recommendation (which is \( R \)).

So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake from \( 5R \) to \( R \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Amount of Coffee Juan Must Reduce
The reduction needed in Juan's coffee intake is:
\[ \text{Reduction} = 5R - R = 4R \]

### Final Answer
By how many cups must Juan reduce his daily coffee intake? The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

Subtracting the daily recommended amount from Juan’s current coffee intake gives 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups
Juan must therefore reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1) First, let's determine how much Susan weighs.
   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.
   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
     So, Susan's weight = 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

2) Now that we know Susan's weight, let's find out what Bob weighs.
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
     So, Bob's weight = 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.

3) We now have all three weights: Mark (150 pounds), Susan (130 pounds), and Bob (260 pounds).
4) To find the average weight, we need to add up these three weights and then divide by the number of friends (which is 3).

   Average weight = (Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight) / Number of friends
                  = (150 + 130 + 260) / 3
                  = 540 / 3

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much the sun's position changes over time due to its movement relative to the pyramid. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the initial position of the sun relative to the pyramid
- At the start (0 hours), the sun is directly above the tip of the pyramid.

### Step 2: Calculate the change in the sun's position per hour
- The sun moves upwards at a rate of 5 degrees per hour.

### Step 3: Calculate the total change in the sun's position after 10 hours
- Since the sun moves 5 degrees per hour, after 10 hours, it will have moved \(10 \times 5 = 50\) degrees upwards.

### Step 4: Determine the new position of the sun relative to the pyramid
- After 10 hours, the sun will be at an angle of \(32^\circ + 50^\circ = 82^\circ\) from the ground relative to Sahir's house.

\[ \text{Age of second son} = 12 - 4 = 8 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of candles needed
James has two sons, so he needs candles for both:
\[ \text{Total number of candles} = 12 + 8 = 20 \]

### Step 3: Determine how many packs of candles are required
Each pack contains 5 candles. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of candles by the number in one pack:
\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Each pack costs $3. So, for 4 packs, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

### Conclusion
James spends a total of $12 on candles.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is $\boxed{12}$<|im_end|>","His younger son is 12-4=<<12-4=8>>8 years old

                    question:
                    In the first week, : Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. In , the second week, she read a total of 100 pages. If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, how many pages did she read in two weeks?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how long Judy reads per night.
2. Calculate how many nights she read in the second week.
3. Find out how many pages she read in one night.
4. Multiply that number by the number of days in the second week.

Step 1: Determine how long Judy reads per night.
Judy reads for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep.

Step 2: Calculate how many nights she read in the second week.
She read a total of 100 pages over the course of the second week.

Step 3: Find out how many pages she read in one night.
We know that she reads 2 pages per 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads per night, we need to calculate her reading rate.

First, let's determine how much time she spends reading each night.
Since she reads for 15 minutes each night, we can set up a proportion based on her reading speed.

\[
\text{Reading Rate} = \frac{\text{Pages Read}}{\text{Time Spent Reading}}
\]

Given that she reads at a rate of 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can express this as:

\[
\text{Reading Rate} = \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\text{Reading Rate} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \text{ pages per minute}
\]

Now, using this rate, we can calculate how many pages she reads per night:

\[
\text{Pages Per Night} = \text{Reading Rate} \times \text{Time Spent Reading}
\]
\[
\text{Pages Per Night} = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \times 15 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Pages Per Night} = 20 \text{ pages}
\]

Step 4: Multiply that number by the number of days in the second week.
There are typically 7 days in a week.

So, the total number of pages read in the second week would be:

\[
\text{Total Pages in Second Week} = \text{Pages Per Night} \times \text{Number of Nights}
\]
\[
\text{Total Pages in Second Week} = 20 \text{ pages/night} \times 7 \text{ nights}
\]
\[
\text{Total Pages in Second Week} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, Judy read a total of 140 pages in the second week. 

The final answer is: The final answer is 140.<|im_end|>","Every night, Judy reads 15 minutes/1.5 minutes = <<15/1.5=10>>10 sets of 2 pages.
So, she read 10 x 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 pages every night in the first week.
In the first week, she reads a total of 20 x 7 = <<20*7=140>>140 pages.
Therefore, she read a total of 140 + 100 = <<140+100=240>>240 pages in two weeks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many sandwiches are left, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate:**
   - Cody ate a third of the total sandwiches.
   - Total sandwiches = 12
   - Number of sandwiches Cody ate = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12\)
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate:**
   - Trevor ate a quarter of the total sandwiches.
   - Total sandwiches = 12
   - Number of sandwiches Trevor ate = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12\)
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Subtract the number of sandwiches eaten from the total number of sandwiches:**
   - Total sandwiches = 12
   - Sandwiches eaten by Cody = 4
   - Sandwiches eaten by Trevor = 3
   - Sandwiches left = \(12 - (4 + 3)\)

4. **Perform the addition inside the parentheses first (according to order of operations):**
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   So,
   \[

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the current age of Shiloh**: Shiloh is currently 44 years old.

2. **Define variables for future ages**:
   - Let \( S \) represent Shiloh's age in \( n \) years.
   - Let \( N \) represent his nephew's age in \( n \) years.

3. **Formulate equations based on the given information**:
   - In 7 years from now, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.
   - The nephew will be \( N \) years younger than Shiloh.

4. **Set up an equation representing their ages at that time**:
   Since we know the nephew will be three times as old as his uncle when Shiloh is 51, we can write:
   \[
   51 = 3N
   \]

5. **Solve for \( N \)**:
   \[
   N = \frac{51}{3} = 17
   \]
   So, the nephew will be 17 years old in 7 years.

6. **Calculate the current age of the nephew**:
   Since we're looking for the current age of the nephew, we subtract 7 years from his future age:
   \[
   N_{\text{current}} = 17 - 7 = 10
   \]

Therefore, the nephew is currently 10 years old.<|im_end|>","In 7 years, Shiloh will be 44 + 7 = <<44+7=51>>51 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps based on how much money the tooth fairy gives at different stages.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total amount given for the first tooth.
- The tooth fairy leaves Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
- This is straightforward, so no further calculation needed here.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total amount given for the next three teeth.
- For each of these three teeth, the tooth fairy gives Sharon $1.00.
- Total for these three teeth = \(3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00\).

#### Step 3: Calculate the total amount given for the last two teeth.
- For each of the last two teeth, the amount given decreases by half from what was previously given.
- For the second-to-last tooth (after giving $1.00), the amount is reduced to \( \frac{1}{2} \) of what was given before.
- For the third-to-last tooth, the amount is again halved compared to what was given after the second-to-last one.

Let's calculate the amounts for the last two teeth:

- Amount for the second-to-last tooth = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \$1.00 = \$0.50 \).
- Amount for the third-to-last tooth = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \$0.50 = \$0.25 \).

#### Step 4: Sum up all the amounts given.
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Second-to-last tooth: $0.50
- Third-to-last tooth: $0.25

Total amount = $5.00 + $3.00 + $0.50 + $0.25 = **$9.75**.

### Conclusion:
The tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $9.75.<|im_end|>","She got $1.00 on three teeth so she got 1*3 = $<<1*3=3.00>>3.00

                    Three teenagers are playing soccer on the weekend. Richie, the first teenager, scored 20 more goals than Mark and scored 45 more goals than Anna. If Richie scored 80 goals, how : many goals did all three teenagers score?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals each teenager scored and then sum them up.

1. **Determine Anna's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.
   - Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.
   - According to the information, \( 80 = A + 45 \).
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 80 - 45 = 35
     \]
   So, Anna scored 35 goals.

2. **Determine Mark's Goals:**
   - Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
   - According to the information, \( 80 = M + 20 \).
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 80 - 20 = 60
     \]
   So, Mark scored 60 goals.

3. **Sum the Goals:**
   - Richie scored 80 goals.
   - Anna scored 35 goals.
   - Mark scored 60 goals.
   - The total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is:
     \[
     80 + 35 + 60 = 175
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 175 goals.<|im_end|>","If Richie scored 80 goals, which is 20 more goals than Mark, Mark scored 80-20 = <<80-20=60>>60 goals.

Richie also scored 45 more goals than Anna, which means Anna scored 80-45 = <<80-45=35>>35 goals.
All three teenagers scored 140+35 = <<140+35=175>>175 goals.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Mitchell made by selling lemonade and then compare it to what Liam made.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine how many lemonades Mitchell sold:**
   - Liam made $63 in total.
   - Each lemonade was sold for $4.
   
   Let \( x \) be the number of lemonades sold by Mitchell.
   
   The equation representing the revenue from Mitchell's sales is:
   \[
   4x = 63
   \]
   
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{63}{4} = 15.75
   \]

   Since the number of lemonades must be an integer (you can't sell a fraction of a lemonade), we need to round up or down based on the context, but here we assume they sold exactly 15.75 which doesn't make sense in practical terms as you can't sell partial lemonades. We will proceed with the assumption that they sold 15 whole lemonades if rounding down would not suffice in practical terms.

2. **Calculate Mitchell's earnings:**
   - If Mitchell sold 15 lemonades at $4 each,
     his total earnings would be:
     \[
     15 \times 4 = \$60
     \]

3. **Compare Mitchell’s earnings to Liam’s earnings:**
   - Liam made $63.
   - Mitchell made $60.

Thus, Mitchell made $6 more than Liam by selling lemonade during the weekend.

### Final Answer:
\[

To determine how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to calculate the number of wooden and plastic action figures he buys over the course of the week.

1. **Calculate the total cost for wooden action figures:**
   - Peter spends $5 on each wooden action figure.
   - He does this from Sunday through Wednesday (4 days).
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for plastic action figures:**
   - Peter also spends $2 on each plastic action figure.
   - He does this from Thursday through Sunday (4 days).
   \[
   2 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total amount of money Peter has left after spending on both types of action figures:**
   - Peter starts with $70.
   - After spending $20 on wooden action figures, he has:
     \[
     70 \text{ dollars} - 20 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - After spending $8 on plastic action figures, he has:
     \[
     50 \text{ dollars} - 8 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have bought a total of:

- Wooden action figures: 4 (since he bought them all within the first 4 days)
- Plastic action figures: 4 (since he bought them all within the last 4 days)

Adding these together gives the total number of action figures:
\[

To determine how much the kitten has cost Leah so far, we need to calculate the cost for spaying, vaccinations, and the damage done to vases. Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Spaying
- The cost of spaying the kitten is given as $200.
  
### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Vaccinations
- There are three vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20.
  - Total cost for vaccinations = Number of vaccines × Cost per vaccine
  - Total cost for vaccinations = 3 × $20 = $60
  
### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of Vase Damage
- The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12.
  - Total cost for vase damage = Number of vases × Cost per vase
  - Total cost for vase damage = 4 × $12 = $48
  
### Step 4: Sum Up All Costs
- Now, let’s add up all these costs to find out the total amount spent on the kitten so far.
  - Total cost = Cost of spaying + Cost of vaccinations + Cost of vase damage
  - Total cost = $200 + $60 + $48 = $308
  
### Conclusion

                    question:
                    Ford owns a garden and he grows 40 roses every week. . He supplies Roses to the local flower shops. The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop ; orders 15 roses, and the third flower ! shop orders 30 roses per week. How many roses does Ford , lack to supply ! all the flower shops ? every month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops in one month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Weekly Orders
First, let's calculate the total number of roses ordered weekly from all three flower shops.

- **First flower shop**: 20 roses
- **Second flower shop**: 15 roses
- **Third flower shop**: 30 roses

Total weekly orders = \(20 + 15 + 30\)

\[ 
= 65 \text{ roses} 
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Orders
Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can find out the monthly orders by multiplying the weekly orders by 4.

\[ 
\text{Monthly Orders} = 65 \times 4 
\]

\[ 
= 260 \text{ roses} 
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Weekly Supply
Ford currently supplies 40 roses every week.

### Step 4: Determine Weekly Shortage
Now, subtract the weekly supply from the total weekly order to find out how many roses Ford needs to supply weekly but doesn't have enough.

\[ 
\text{Weekly Shortage} = 65 - 40 
\]

\[ 
= 25 \text{ roses} 
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Monthly Shortage
Finally, multiply the weekly shortage by 4 (since there are 4 weeks in a month) to get the monthly shortage.

\[ 
\text{Monthly Shortage} = 25 \times 4 
\]

\[ 
= 100 \text{ roses}

### Conclusion
Ford lacks 100 roses every month to meet the demand from all the flower shops. Therefore, the final answer is:

**The final answer is:** 100 roses.<|im_end|>","The first flower shop needs 20 x 4 = <<20*4=80>>80 roses every month.
The second flower shop needs 15 x 4= <<15*4=60>>60 roses every month.
The third flower shop needs 30 x 4 = <<30*4=120>>120 roses every month.
So the total number of roses that all the flower shop needs every month is 120 + 80 + 60 = <<120+80+60=260>>260.
The total roses Ford grows every month is 40 x 4 = <<40*4=160>>160
Therefore, the total number of roses he lacks is 260 - 160 = <<260-160=100>>100 to supply all the flower shops every month.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money removed over the course of 2 years (which is 24 months) and then subtract that from the initial balance.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the monthly removal rate:**
   - Katina removes $100 per month.
   
2. **Calculate the total number of months in 2 years:**
   - There are 12 months in one year.
   - Therefore, for 2 years, there are \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) months.

3. **Compute the total removal amount over 2 years:**
   - Monthly removal rate: $100/month
   - Total removal over 24 months: \( 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars} \)

4. **Subtract the total removal amount from the initial balance:**
   - Initial balance: $3000
   - Remaining balance after 2 years: \( 3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars} \)

5. **Final Answer:**
   The final remaining balance in Katina's savings account after 2 years is \( \$600 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    A food truck only sells grilled cheeses.  They source their bread for $3.00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  They spend $30.00 on different cheeses : and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  If they sell , 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, what is their net profit?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the food truck's net profit, we need to calculate both the total revenue from sales and the total costs incurred.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue
- The food truck sells 10 sandwiches at $7.00 each.
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$7.00 = \$70.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Costs
- **Cost of Bread**: 
  - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00.
  - Since one loaf can make 10 sandwiches, it will be used once in this scenario (assuming the rest are not sold).
  \[ \text{Cost of Bread} = \$3.00 \]
  
- **Cost of Cheeses and Condiments**:
  - The cost of cheese and condiments is given as $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.
  - Therefore, for 10 sandwiches, the cost is $30.00.

### Step 3: Calculate Net Profit
- Subtract the total costs from the total revenue.
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - (\text{Cost of Bread} + \text{Cost of Cheese and Condiments}) \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - (\$3.00 + \$30.00) \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 \]
\[ \text{Net Profit} = \$37.00 \]

Therefore, the food truck's net profit is {The final answer is} $37.00.<|im_end|>","They spend $3.00 on bread and $30.00 on cheese and condiments for a total of 3+30 = $<<3+30=33.00>>33.00

<|im_start|>sys
To determine how much money Kate can make from selling her crayon muffins, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons available
Kate has three boxes, and each box contains 64 crayons.

\[
3 \text{ boxes} \times 64 \text{ crayons per box} = 192 \text{ crayons}

### Step 2: Determine how many groups of crayons are needed for the muffins
Each muffin requires 8 small pieces of crayons. Therefore, we divide the total number of crayons by the number required for one muffin:

\[
\frac{192 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons per muffin}} = 24 \text{ muffins}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the muffins
If each muffin sells for $1.50, then the total revenue is calculated as follows:

\[
24 \text{ muffins} \times \$1.50 \text{ per muffin} = \$36
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the total cost for replacing the carpet, we need to calculate the cost based on the area of the room, the cost of the carpet, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet. Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Room
First, we find out how many square feet there are in the room.
- The room dimensions are given as 18 feet by 12 feet.
\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ ft} \times 12 \text{ ft} = 216 \text{ sq ft} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost Per Square Foot for Each Component
Now that we know the area, let’s figure out the individual costs for each component:

1. **Cost of New Carpet**
   - The cost of the carpet itself is $12 per square foot.
   - Total cost for the carpet alone: \( 216 \text{ sq ft} \times \$12/\text{sq ft} = \$2592 \).

2. **Cost of Padding Underneath**
   - The cost of padding is $2 per square foot.
   - Total cost for padding: \( 216 \text{ sq ft} \times \$2/\text{sq ft} = \$432 \).

3. **Cost of Removing Old Carpet**
   - The cost to remove the old carpet is $4 per square foot.
   - Total removal cost: \( 216 \text{ sq ft} \times \$4/\text{sq ft} = \$864 \).

4. **Cost of Installing New Carpet**
   - The cost to install the new carpet is $34 per square foot.
   - Total installation cost: \( 216 \text{ sq ft} \times \$34/\text{sq ft} = \$7304 \).

### Step 3: Sum Up All Costs
Now, add up all these costs to get the total cost.

Total cost:
\[ \$2592 + \$432 + \$864 + \$7304 = \$10192 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom is \(\boxed{\$10192}\).<|im_end|>","The room measures 18 * 12 = <<18*12=216>>216 square feet.
The new carpet costs $12 * 216 = $<<12*216=2592>>2,592.
The new carpet padding costs $2 * 216 = $<<2*216=432>>432.
To remove the old carpet, the contractor will charge $4 * 216 = $<<4*216=864>>864.
To install the new carpet, the contractor will charge $34 * 216 = $<<34*216=7344>>7,344.
The total cost will be $864 + $2,592 + $432 + $7,344 = $11,232.

- Day 1: 50 birds (total so far)
- Day 2: 50 birds (total so far)
- Day 3: 0 birds (total so far)
- Day 4: 120 birds (total so far)
- Day 5: 120 birds (total so far)
- Day 6: 20 birds (total so far)

Total number of birds seen = 50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = **4 \times 50 + 20 + 90 = 200 + 20 + 90 = 310**

**Step 2: Divide the total number of birds by the number of days to find the average.**

Number of days = 7

Average number of birds seen per day = Total number of birds / Number of days = 310 / 7 ≈ 44.286

Therefore, on average, Mack sees **44.286 birds per day**.

{The final answer is} 44.286<|im_end|>","On days one to three, Mack saw 50+0=<<50+0=50>>50 birds.

   - Add half the number: \( 20 + \frac{20}{2} = 20 + 10 = 30 \).

3. **Second Operation**:
   - Divide the result by 5: \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

4. **Third Operation**:
   - Multiply the result by the starting value minus 12: \( 6 \times (20 - 12) \).

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Subtract 12 from the starting value: \( 20 - 12 = 8 \).
   - Multiply the second operation's result by this difference: \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \).

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to determine the correct setting on Maggie's oven based on the given information about its malfunction.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the Percentage Mismatch:**
   - The oven is currently set to 450 degrees but reaches 468 degrees.
   - Calculate the difference between these temperatures: \( 468 - 450 = 18 \) degrees.
   
2. **Find the Percentage Difference:**
   - To find out how much the oven is off, divide the difference by the original setting: 
     \[
     \text{Percentage Off} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100\% = 4\%
     \]
   - This means the oven is off by 4%.

3. **Apply the Same Percentage Off to the Recipe Temperature:**
   - The recipe calls for 520 degrees.
   - Apply the same percentage (4%) decrease to the recipe temperature:
     \[
     \text{Adjusted Temperature} = 520 - (520 \times 0.04)
     \]
   - Calculate the adjustment amount:
     \[
     520 \times 0.04 = 20.8
     \]
   - Subtract this from the original temperature:
     \[
     520 - 20.8 = 499.2
     \]

### Final Answer:
Maggie should set the oven to approximately 499.2 degrees for her recipe.<|im_end|>","The oven off by 18 degrees because 468 - 450 = <<468-450=18>>18

To solve this problem, we need to convert both movie lengths into minutes and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Convert the length of the first movie from hours and minutes to just minutes.
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- We know that 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- Therefore, 1 hour 30 minutes = (60 + 30) minutes = 90 minutes.

### Step 2: Convert the length of the second movie from hours and minutes to just minutes.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- Similarly, 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes.
- Adding the remaining 5 minutes gives us 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

### Step 3: Add the lengths of both movies together.
- First movie length in minutes: 90 minutes.
- Second movie length in minutes: 125 minutes.
- Total time in minutes: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the price of Juan's house:**
   - We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.
   - Let \( H \) represent the value of Herb's house.
   - Therefore, Juan's house value can be expressed as \( H - 0.3H = 0.7H \).

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house using the information about the total cost:**
   - Herb's house costs $76,000.
   - Since Juan's house is 30% cheaper, it means \( 0.7H = \$76,000 \).
   - To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 0.7:
     \[
     H = \frac{76,000}{0.7} \approx 109,285.71
     \]
     (We round to two decimal places for practical purposes.)

3. **Find the value of Juan's house:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend.

1. **Determine the number of dishes Judy initially bought:**
   - Judy bought a dozen (12) cups.
   - She also bought twice as many dishes as cups.
   
   Therefore, the number of dishes Judy bought = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

2. **Calculate the number of dishes Judy found at the event:**
   - Her friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy did originally.
   
   Therefore, the number of additional dishes from her friend = \( 24 + 20 = 44 \).

3. **Calculate the total number of dishes Judy brought to the event:**
   - Total dishes = \( 24 \text{ (original)} + 44 \text{ (additional)} = 68 \).

4. **Summarize the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:**
   - Judy’s total = \( 12 \text{ (cups)} + 68 \text{ (dishes)} = 80 \).
   - Friend’s total = \( 40 \text{ (cups)} + 20 \text{ (dishes)} = 60 \).

5. **Add both totals together:**
   - Combined total = \( 80 \text{ (Judy's utensils)} + 60 \text{ (Friend's utensils)} = 140 \).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of boxes needed**

- Pete needs 90 single-use contacts.
- Each box contains 10 contacts.

First, calculate how many boxes are required:
\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total contacts}}{\text{Contacts per box}} = \frac{90}{10} = 9 \text{ boxes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the original price for all boxes**

- Each box costs $100.00.
- Therefore, the total cost before any discount would be:
\[
\text{Total cost (before discount)} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box} = 9 \times 100 = \$900.00
\]

**Step 3: Apply the 10% discount**

- The current discount is 10%. So, we need to subtract 10% from the total cost calculated above.

Calculate the discounted amount:
\[
\text{Discounted amount} = \text{Total cost (before discount)} \times \left(\frac{10}{100}\right) = 900 \times 0.10 = \$90.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Final total cost} = \text{Total cost (before discount)} - \text{Discounted amount} = 900 - 90 = \$810.00
\]

**Step 4: Determine the cost per box if Pete buys two boxes**

- Pete buys 2 boxes at the discounted price.
- Total cost after buying 2 boxes is $810.00.
- Number of boxes bought is 2.

Now, calculate the cost per box:
\[
\text{Cost per box} = \frac{\text{Total cost (after discount)}}{\text{Number of boxes bought}} = \frac{810}{2} = \$405.00
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is}$405.00}<|im_end|>","Each box of contacts is $100.00 with 10% off so that's 100*.10 = $<<100*.10=10.00>>10.00 off

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours each person worked and then calculate their earnings based on the hourly rate of $10 per hour.

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's total hours worked
- Jill worked for 2 hours on Saturday.
- Jill worked for 1 hour on Sunday.

Total hours worked by Jill = 2 hours (Saturday) + 1 hour (Sunday) = 3 hours

### Step 2: Calculate John's total hours worked
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday.

Since Jill worked 3 hours in total:

- On Saturday: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) hours
- On Sunday: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours

Total hours worked by John = 6 hours (Saturday) + 9 hours (Sunday) = 15 hours

### Step 3: Calculate earnings for both Jill and John
Each person earns $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 \]

John's earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$150 \]

### Step 4: Determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill
Difference in earnings:
\[ \$150 - \$30 = \$120 \]

### Final Answer
John earned $120 more than Jill. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\$120}

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories burned**

- **Aerobics**: 
  - Time spent: 2 hours
  - Calories per hour: 500 calories
  - Total calories burned = \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} \)

\[
= 1000 \text{ calories}
\]

- **Running**:
  - Time spent: 1 hour
  - Calories per hour: 600 calories
  - Total calories burned = \( 1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} \)

\[
= 600 \text{ calories}
\]

**Step 2: Sum up all the calories burned**

\[
\text{Total calories burned} = 1000 \text{ calories (aerobics)} + 600 \text{ calories (running)}
\]

\[
= 1600 \text{ calories}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of water needed based on calorie consumption**

- The ratio given is that 100 ml of water is consumed for every 200 calories.
  
Using this ratio, calculate the required water intake for 1600 calories.

\[
\text{Water needed} = \left( \frac{\text{Total calories}}{\text{Calories per ml of water}} \right) \times \text{ml of water per calorie}
\]

\[
= \left( \frac{1600}{200} \right) \times 100
\]

\[
= 8 \times 100
\]

\[
= 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Therefore, Hannah needs to drink \(\boxed{800}\) ml of water.<|im_end|>","First find the total calories burned on aerobics: 2 hours * 500 calories/hour = <<2*500=1000>>1000 calories

                    At the Burger Palace restaurant, there is an enormous jar containing red, blue and ! green jelly beans.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's define some variables to represent the number of jelly beans in each color:

- Let \( B \) be the number of blue jelly beans.
- Let \( R \) be the number of red jelly beans.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green jelly beans.

From the information given:

1. The jar contains **1% fewer** red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
   \]

2. It also states that **1% more** green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B
   \]

3. We know the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500:
   \[
   R + B + G = 4500
   \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) from above into the total equation:
\[
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
(0.99 + 1.01 + 1.00)B = 4500
\]
\[
3.00B = 4500
\]

Solve for \( B \):
\[
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now we can find the number of red and green jelly beans using the values of \( B \):

- Red jelly beans (\( R \)):
\[
R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]

- Green jelly beans (\( G \)):
\[
G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]

Finally, calculate how many more green jelly beans there are compared to red jelly beans:
\[
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: The jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.<|im_end|>","If the total number of jelly beans is 4500, there must be 1500 blue jelly beans

To find the average of the three measurements, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the third typing speed after increasing by 5 words.
2. Sum the three speeds.
3. Divide the sum by 3.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the third typing speed
Jared increases his typing speed from 47 WPM to 52 WPM. Then, he increases this new speed by an additional 5 words.

First, let's calculate the third speed:
\[ \text{New speed} = 52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM} \]

### Step 2: Sum the three speeds
Now, we add up the three measured speeds:
\[ \text{Sum} = 47 + 52 + 57 \]

Performing the addition:
\[ 47 + 52 = 99 \]
\[ 99 + 57 = 156 \]

So, the total sum of the three speeds is 156 WPM.

### Step 3: Divide the sum by 3
Finally, we divide the total sum by 3 to get the average:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is **52 WPM**.<|im_end|>","Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.

To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight loss over 5 weeks if Martin eats Cheerios.
2. Calculate the total weight gain over 5 weeks if Martin eats donuts.
3. Subtract the total weight gain from the total weight loss.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **Total weight loss over 5 weeks if eating Cheerios:**
   - Weight loss per week = 1.25 pounds
   - Number of weeks = 5
   - Total weight loss = 1.25 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 6.25 pounds

2. **Total weight gain over 5 weeks if eating donuts:**
   - Weight gain per week = 1.75 pounds
   - Number of weeks = 5
   - Total weight gain = 1.75 pounds/week × 5 weeks = 8.75 pounds

Now, let's find the difference between the total weight loss and the total weight gain:

- Difference in weight = Total weight loss - Total weight gain
- Difference in weight = 6.25 pounds - 8.75 pounds = -2.50 pounds

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is \(-2.5\) pounds. This means Martin will have lost 2.5 pounds more than he would have gained from eating donuts over 5 weeks.<|im_end|>","First find the difference in weight gain per week: 1.75 pounds/week - ( -1.25 pounds/week) = 1.75 pounds/week + 1.25 pounds/week = <<1.75-(-1.25)=3>>3 pounds/week
Then multiply the weight gain per week by the number of weeks to find the total difference at the end of 5 weeks: 5 weeks * 3 pounds/week = <<5*3=15>>15 pounds

To determine how many seats Alex needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Initial Invitations**:
   - Alex initially invites 100 people.

2. **Invitations from Invited Friends**:
   - Each of the 100 invited people invites 2 more people.
   - Number of additional invitations: \( 100 \times 2 = 200 \) people.

3. **Additional Invitations Called by Alex**:
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends who then invite others.
   - Number of additional invitations called by Alex: \( 10 \).

4. **Total Invitations Including Spouses**:
   - Let's denote the number of friends who will bring their spouses as \( x \).
   - The total number of invited guests (including spouses) would be:
     - Initial invitations: \( 100 + 200 = 300 \)
     - Additional invitations called by Alex: \( 10 \)
     - Total guests: \( 300 + 10 = 310 \)

5. **Spouse Invitations**:
   - According to the information provided, 8 of Alex's friends will bring their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of spouses needed is 8.

6. **Calculate the Required Seats**:
   - To find out how many seats Alex needs, we add the initial 310 guests to the 8 spouses.
   - Number of seats required: \( 310 + 8 = 318 \)

Therefore, Alex will need 318 seats at the event.<|im_end|>","Each of the people that were emailed are bringing 2 friends, which means that they will be in groups of 1 +2 = <<1+2=3>>3 people.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each dog based on their positions in the line and the given relationships between their weights.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Affenpinscher** (first dog):
   - Weighs 10 pounds.

2. **Dachshund** (second dog):
   - Weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   - Calculation: \( 10 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Papillon** (third dog):
   - Weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   - Calculation: \( 20 \text{ pounds} \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Mastiff** (fourth dog):
   - Weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   - Calculation: \( 5 \text{ pounds} \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds} \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for both websites and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at Amazon.com
- The price of the boots is $16.
- Shipping cost at Amazon.com is $4.

Total cost at Amazon.com = Price of boots + Shipping cost
= $16 + $4
= $20

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at eBay
- The price of the boots is $13.
- The shipping cost at eBay is twice what it is at Amazon.com. 

Shipping cost at eBay = 2 × Shipping cost at Amazon.com
= 2 × $4
= $8

Total cost at eBay = Price of boots + Shipping cost
= $13 + $8
= $21

### Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.com
Difference in cost = Total cost at eBay - Total cost at Amazon.com
= $21 - $20
= $1

Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive when bought on eBay compared to buying them on Amazon.com.

**The final answer is:** The boots work out to be $1 more expensive on eBay.<|im_end|>","The total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $<<16+4=20>>20
Shipping on eBay costs $4 x 2 = $<<4*2=8>>8

The boots cost $21 - $20 = $<<21-20=1>>1 more on eBay

                    question:
                    Mark plants a beanstalk below his second-story window, which is 20 ? feet off the ground. The beanstalk doubles its height every day. If the beanstalk : starts out 4 feet tall, how many days ! will it take to be taller than Mark's window?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Height**: The beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
2. **Height Doubling Rule**: Each day, the height doubles.

Let's calculate the height after each day until it exceeds 20 feet.

- **Day 1**:
  - Initial height: \( 4 \) feet
  - Height after doubling: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) feet

- **Day 2**:
  - Height before doubling: \( 8 \) feet
  - Height after doubling: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) feet

Since the height on Day 2 (16 feet) is still less than 20 feet, let's continue:

- **Day 3**:
  - Height before doubling: \( 16 \) feet
  - Height after doubling: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \) feet

Now, we compare this height to the window height:
- On Day 3, the height is 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it takes **3 days** for the beanstalk to reach a height that is taller than Mark's window. 

{The final answer is} 3 days.<|im_end|>","To find the beanstalk's height after one day, multiply the starting height by 2: 4 feet * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 feet
To find its height after two days, multiply the height after one day by 2: 8 feet * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 feet
To find its height after three days, multiply the height after two days by 2: 16 feet * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 feet. This is taller than the window, so it took three days for the beanstalk to pass the window.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To determine how much protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms daily, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Protein Per Day
First, we need to find out how much protein John consumes in one day.

- Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
  
  Therefore, for 200 grams of mushrooms (which is twice as much),
  
\[ \text{Protein per day} = 200 \times \frac{3}{100} \]
\[ \text{Protein per day} = 6 \text{ grams} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Protein Per Week
Next, we calculate the total amount of protein John consumes over a week.

- There are 7 days in a week,
  
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 6 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total protein per week} = 42 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define the current age**: Let \( J \) represent Jerry's current age.

2. **Understand the relationship given**: The statement ""Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago"" can be translated mathematically.
   - Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \( J - 5 \).
   - According to the problem, Jerry's current age (\( J \)) is twice his age five years ago (which is \( J - 5 \)).
   
   Therefore, we set up the equation: 
   \[
   J = 2(J - 5)
   \]

3. **Solve for \( J \)**:
   - Expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     J = 2J - 10
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( J \):
     \[
     J - 2J = -10 \\
     -J = -10 \\
     J = 10
     \]

4. **Determine Jerry's current age**: We find that Jerry is currently 10 years old.

5. **Calculate Jerry's age in 3 years**:
   - If Jerry is 10 years old now, then in 3 years, he will be:
     \[
     10 + 3 = 13
     \]

6. **Final Answer**: Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

{The final answer is} 13<|im_end|>","We know that Jerry's Age/2 = Jerry's Age - 5
Therefore Jerry's Age = 2 Jerry's age - 10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each implant including the additional features.
- The base price of each implant is $2000.
- One of the implants requires a crown made of porcelain, which adds $500.

Therefore, the total cost for each implant will be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$2000 + \$500 = \$2500 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total cost for all two implants.
Since there are two implants, we multiply the total cost of one implant by 2:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$2500 \times 2 = \$5000 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the amount George has already paid from the total cost.
George has already deposited $600 towards his dental work. Therefore, the remaining amount he needs to cover is:
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$5000 - \$600 = \$4400 \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn the required amount.
George earns $15 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \text{Hours Needed} = \frac{\$4400}{\$15/hour} \]

Performing the division gives us:
\[ \text{Hours Needed} = 293.33 \text{ hours} \]

### Final Answer:
George needs to work approximately **293.33 hours** before he has enough money to pay for the dental work.<|im_end|>","The total base cost of the implants is 2 * $2000 = $<<2*2000=4000>>4000.
Adding the porcelain crown increases the total to $4000 + $500 = $<<4000+500=4500>>4500.
Subtracting the deposit, George needs to pay a total of $4500 - $600 = $<<4500-600=3900>>3900.
This means George would need to work a total of $3900 / $15 per hour = <<3900/15=260>>260 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measures of all three angles in a triangle where two specific relationships exist between them.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's denote the smallest angle as \( x \).

### Step 2: Express Other Angles in Terms of \( x \)
According to the given conditions:

- The second angle is three times the smallest angle.
\[ \text{Second Angle} = 3x \]

- The third angle is twice the smallest angle.
\[ \text{Third Angle} = 2x \]

### Step 3: Use the Triangle Sum Property
Since the sum of the interior angles of any triangle equals 180 degrees, we can write an equation for the sum of these angles:
\[ x + 3x + 2x = 180^\circ \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[ x + 3x + 2x = 6x \]
So,
\[ 6x = 180^\circ \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 6 to find the value of \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180^\circ}{6} \]
\[ x = 30^\circ \]

### Step 6: Calculate Each Angle
Now that we have found \( x \), we can calculate the other two angles:
- Smallest angle (\( x \)):
\[ x = 30^\circ \]

- Second angle (three times the smallest angle):
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ \]

- Third angle (twice the smallest angle):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \]

### Step 7: Identify the Largest Angle
The largest angle in the triangle is the third angle calculated above:
\[ \text{Largest Angle} = 90^\circ \]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{90^\circ}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the measure of the smallest angle

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of the coins in cents:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25, so 8 quarters = \( 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \) dollars.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10, so 6 dimes = \( 6 \times 0.10 = 0.60 \) dollars.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05, so 14 nickels = \( 14 \times 0.05 = 0.70 \) dollars.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01, so 15 pennies = \( 15 \times 0.01 = 0.15 \) dollars.

   Adding all these values together gives us the total amount of money Colby has in cents:
   \[
   2 + 0.60 + 0.70 + 0.15 = 3.55 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much money Colby spends on one gumball:**
   - Each gumball costs a nickel, which is equivalent to $0.05 in terms of quarters or nickels.

3. **Calculate how many gumballs Colby can buy with his total money:**
   - To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide his total money by the cost per gumball:
     \[
     \frac{3.55}{0.05} = 71
     \]

Therefore, Colby can buy 71 gumballs.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of legs each type of animal has and then multiply it by the number of that type of animal present.

Step 1: Identify the number of animals of each type.
- Dogs: 5
- Cats: 2
- Birds: 10

Step 2: Determine how many legs each type of animal has.
- Each dog has 4 legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of legs for each type of animal.
- For dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Step 4: Add up all the legs from each type of animal to get the total number of legs in the store.
Total legs = Legs from dogs + Legs from cats + Legs from birds
Total legs = \(20 \text{ (dogs)} + 8 \text{ (cats)} + 20 \text{ (birds)}\)
Total legs = \(20 + 8 + 20\)
Total legs = \(48\)

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Weight**: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight.

2. **Increase the Weight**: Jamaal increases his weight by 50%.

   - To calculate 50% of 8 pounds:
     \[

To determine how many games Steve has after three years, we need to break down his purchases over those three years and sum them up.

### Year 1
- **Initial Console Purchase**: 
  - Cost: $0 (since it's free)
  
- **Monthly Savings**:
  - Steve saves enough to buy 1 game per month.

                    question:
                    A plane travels 1200 miles . in 3 hours. At the same rate, how many . additional hours would it take to travel an additional 2000 miles?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the plane to travel 2000 miles at its current speed. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Calculate the Plane's Speed
First, let's find out how fast the plane is traveling.

- The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- Therefore, the speed (rate) of the plane can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
\]

\[
\text{Speed} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Time Required for Additional Distance
Now that we know the plane’s speed, we can calculate how long it will take to travel an additional distance of 2000 miles.

- We already know the total distance to be traveled is 2000 miles.
- The speed of the plane is 400 miles per hour.

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

We substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, if the plane continues to fly at the same rate, it would take an additional **5 hours** to travel an extra 2000 miles.<|im_end|>","The rate is 1200/3=<<1200/3=400>>400 mph.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much chocolate Ruiz makes per hour
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.

First, find out how much he makes per hour:
\[ \text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \]

### Step 2: Determine how much Marissa makes per hour
Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates per hour as Ruiz.

So, we multiply Ruiz's hourly rate by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
\[ \text{Marissa's hourly rate} = 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much both can produce together in one hour
Now, add their rates to find the combined rate at which they work together:
\[ \text{Combined hourly rate} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds/hour} \]

### Step 4: Calculate how much they make together over 12 hours
Finally, multiply their combined hourly rate by the number of working hours (12 hours) to get the total amount of chocolates produced:
\[ \text{Total chocolates produced} = 105 \times 12 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is **1260 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Merissa makes 3/4 * 120 pounds = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolate in two hours; this means she makes 120 pounds / 2 hours = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolate in an hour.
If they worked for 12 hours, Ruiz made 12 hours * 60 pounds/hour = <<12*60=720>>720 pounds of chocolate while
Marissa made 90 pounds/hour * 12 hours = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolate
The combined amount of pounds of chocolate they both ate is 1080 pounds + 720 pounds = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolate

Let's break down Howard's spending day by day:

**Day 1 (Monday):**
Howard spends $8.

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**
On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
\[ \text{Amount spent on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Amount spent on Monday} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on Tuesday} = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on Tuesday} = 16 \]

**Day 3 (Wednesday):**
On Wednesday, Howard spends four times as much as he did on Tuesday.
\[ \text{Amount spent on Wednesday} = 4 \times \text{Amount spent on Tuesday} \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on Wednesday} = 4 \times 16 \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on Wednesday} = 64 \]

Now let's calculate the total amount spent over these three days:
\[ \text{Total spent} = \text{Amount spent on Monday} + \text{Amount spent on Tuesday} + \text{Amount spent on Wednesday} \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = 8 + 16 + 64 \]
\[ \text{Total spent} = 88 \]

Finally, we subtract the total amount spent from his original $100 to find out how much money he has left:
\[ \text{Money left} = \text{Original amount} - \text{Total spent} \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 100 - 88 \]
\[ \text{Money left} = 12 \]

Therefore, after all his expenditures, Howard has **$12** left.<|im_end|>","On Tuesday, he spends $8 * 2 = $<<8*2=16>>16.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Patrick earned over a period of six hours by considering his sales rates for different periods.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first four hours

- **Hourly rate**: $0.50 per cup
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 15
- **Total time**: 4 hours

First, let's find out how many cups Patrick sells in one hour:

\[
\text{Cups per hour} = \text{Price per cup} \times \text{Time (in hours)}
\]

\[
\text{Cups per hour} = \$0.50 \times 4 = 2 \text{ cups}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total number of cups sold in four hours:

\[
\text{Total cups in 4 hours} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total time (in hours)} 
\]

\[
\text{Total cups in 4 hours} = 2 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from these 8 cups:

\[
\text{Revenue from 4 hours} = \text{Total cups} \times \text{Price per cup}
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from 4 hours} = 8 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$4.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next two hours

- **Hourly rate**: $0.60 per cup
- **Number of cups sold per hour**: 10
- **Total time**: 2 hours

Calculate the total number of cups sold in two hours:

\[
\text{Total cups in 2 hours} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total time (in hours)}
\]

\[
\text{Total cups in 2 hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from these 20 cups:

\[
\text{Revenue from 2 hours} = \text{Total cups} \times \text{Price per cup}
\]

\[
\text{Revenue from 2 hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00
\]

### Step 3: Sum up both periods' earnings

Add the revenue from the first four hours to the revenue from the next two hours:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from 4 hours} + \text{Revenue from 2 hours}
\]

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \$4.00 + \$12.00 = \$16.00
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over a span of six hours is $\boxed{\$16.00}$.<|im_end|>","Patrick earned $0.50 x 15 = $<<0.5*15=7.50>>7.50 from selling the lemonade for $0.50 per cup.
So for four hours, his total earnings are $7.50 x 4 = $<<7.5*4=30>>30.
He earned $0.60 x 10 = $<<0.60*10=6>>6 from selling the lemonade for $0.60 per cup.
So for two hours, his total earnings are $6 x 2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.
Therefore, Patrick earn a total of $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of months until the tire needs to be replaced based on the total number of rotations it will undergo during that period.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of rotations per mile:**
   - We know that every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
   - Therefore, for 1 mile, the number of rotations would be \( \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \) rotations.

2. **Calculate the total number of miles driven in one year:**
   - Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - So, in one year, he drives \( 400 \times 12 = 4800 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the total number of rotations over one year:**
   - Each mile requires 362.5 rotations.
   - Over 4800 miles, the total number of rotations is \( 4800 \times 362.5 = 174,000 \) rotations.

4. **Calculate the number of rotations needed per year:**
   - Each tire can withstand 10,440,000 rotations.
   - Since there are two tires (front and rear), the total number of rotations per year required is \( 174,000 \times 2 = 348,000 \).

5. **Calculate the number of years until the tire needs to be replaced:**
   - The total number of rotations per year is 348,000.
   - To find out how many years are needed for these rotations, divide the total number of rotations by the number of rotations per year.
   - Number of years = \( \frac{10,440,000}{348,000} \approx 29.99 \) years.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is approximately 30 years}}
\]<|im_end|>","Jeremy drives 400/2=<<400/2=200>>200 segments of 2 miles

So the tire can last for 10,440,000/145,000=<<10440000/145000=72>>72 months
That means the tires will last 72/12=<<72/12=6>>6 years

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of washes Jackie can get from one bottle of shampoo.
According to the directions, using 2 pumps gives 120 washes.

### Step 2: Calculate how many bottles Jackie needs to buy if she wants to achieve at least 120 washes.
Since each bottle provides 2 pumps, we divide the total number of washes needed (120) by the number of pumps per bottle (2).

\[ \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total washes needed}}{\text{Pumps per bottle}} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

So, Jackie would need 60 bottles of shampoo to reach her goal of 120 washes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 60 bottles.
Each bottle costs $24.00.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Cost per bottle} = 60 \times 24.00 \]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication to find the total cost.
\[ 60 \times 24.00 = 1440.00 \]

So, Jackie's total expenditure on shampoo is $1440.00.

### Step 5: Determine the cost per pump.
Now, since each bottle contains 2 pumps, we divide the total cost ($1440.00) by the number of pumps (2).

\[ \text{Cost per pump} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of pumps per bottle}} = \frac{1440.00}{2} \]

### Step 6: Perform the division to find the cost per pump.
\[ \frac{1440.00}{2} = 720.00 \]

Therefore, each pump costs $720.00.

### Final Answer:
\[

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the shirt and shorts with a 30% discount on the clothes and considering any potential sales tax, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted prices for the shirt and shorts.
2. Determine the total cost before tax.
3. Add the sales tax (if applicable) to the total cost.
4. Subtract this amount from Joe's initial $50.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the discounted prices**
- Shirt price without discount: $25
- Shorts price without discount: $35

For the shirt:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$25 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$25 \times 0.70 = \$17.50 \]

For the shorts:
\[ \text{Discounted price} = \$35 \times (1 - 0.30) = \$35 \times 0.70 = \$24.50 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost before tax**
Total cost before tax:
\[ \$17.50 + \$24.50 = \$42 \]

**Step 3: Assume sales tax is applied**
Let's assume the sales tax rate is 8%. This means:
\[ \text{Sales Tax} = \$42 \times 0.08 = \$3.36 \]

So, the total cost including tax:
\[ \$42 + \$3.36 = \$45.36 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from Joe's initial amount**
Joe starts with $50, so:
\[ \$50 - \$45.36 = \$4.64 \]

### Final Answer:
After all purchases and accounting for sales tax if applicable, Joe will have $\boxed{4.64}$ left.<|im_end|>","The price of the two clothing items totals 35 + 25 = <<35+25=60>>60 dollars before discount.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week.
Juan wants to start making 4 dozen croissons per day.

First, calculate the total number of croissons made in one week (7 days):
\[ \text{Total croissons} = 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} \]

Calculate the total number of croissons needed:
\[
4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of butter required to make 28 dozen croissons.
It takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissons.

Therefore, the amount of butter needed for 28 dozen croissons can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
\]
\[
= 28 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pounds}

So, it costs $28, 100 to repave Monica's street.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost to repave Lewis' street**
- Similarly, the cost to repave one meter of street is $194.
- Lewis' street is 490 meters long.

\[
\text{Total cost for Lewis} = \text{Cost per meter} \times \text{Length of Lewis' street}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for Lewis} = \$194 \times 490
\]

Calculate this product:

\[
\$194 \times 490 = \$96, 460
\]

So, it costs $96, 460 to repave Lewis' street.

**Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between the two streets**

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \text{Total cost for Lewis} - \text{Total cost for Monica}
\]

Substitute the calculated values:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \$96, 460 - \$28, 100
\]

Perform the subtraction:

\[
\$96, 460 - \$28, 100 = \$68, 360
\]

Therefore, it costs $68, 360 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is $\boxed{\$68, 360}$<|im_end|>","Total cost to repave Monica’s street is 194*150 = <<194*150=29100>>29,100 dollars.

                    question:
                    John decides to build a program capable of identifying cancer cells.  He gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  , His research ends up taking 10 times that long and every month after those first 5 took 50% more funding per month.  How much did his research cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into its components and calculate the costs over time.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John received $100,000 in the first 5 months.
   
2. **Research Duration:**
   - The research lasted for \(5 \times 10 = 50\) months (since it took 10 times as long as the initial 5 months).

3. **Funding Increase Per Month:**
   - Every subsequent month, the funding increased by 50%.

4. **Calculate Monthly Funding:**
   - Let’s denote the monthly funding for the first 5 months as \(F_1\).
   - For the next 45 months, the funding increases exponentially.

   We can express this mathematically as follows:
   - The amount of funding in the \(n\)-th month can be represented using the formula for compound interest or geometric progression.
   - Specifically, the funding in the \(n\)-th month (\(F_n\)) is given by:
     \[
     F_n = F_1 \cdot r^{n-1}
     \]
     where \(r = 1.5\) (since each month funding increases by 50%).

5. **Summing Up the Costs:**
   - Calculate the total funding required for all 50 months.

Let's perform these calculations:

#### Initial Funding Calculation:
\[ F_1 = \$100,000 \]

#### Subsequent Funding Calculations:
We know that the funding doubles every month, so let's calculate the total funding for each month from \(F_1\) to \(F_{50}\):

\[
\begin{align*}
F_6 &= \$100,000 \cdot (1.5)^5 \\
F_7 &= \$100,000 \cdot (1.5)^6 \\
&\vdots \\
F_{51} &= \$100,000 \cdot (1.5)^{50}
\end{align*}
\]

Now summing up all these values gives us the total cost:

\[
Total\_Cost = \sum_{i=1}^{50} F_i
\]

Using the properties of sums involving geometric series:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{50} F_i = 100,000 \cdot \left(\frac{(1.5)^{50} - 1}{1.5 - 1}\right)
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{50} F_i = 100,000 \cdot \left(\frac{(1.5)^{50} - 1}{0.5}\right) = 200,000 \cdot ((1.5)^{50} - 1)
\]

So, the total cost of John's research is approximately:

\[
Total\_Cost = 200,000 \cdot ((1.5)^{50} - 1)
\]

Calculating this value:

\[
(1.5)^{50} \approx 958.46 \quad (\text{using a calculator})
\]

Therefore,

\[
Total\_Cost \approx 200,000 \cdot (958.46 - 1) \approx 200,000 \cdot 957.46 \approx 191,492,000
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{191,492,000}
\]<|im_end|>","The research ended up taking 5*10=<<5*10=50>>50 months

So the more expensive research cost 20,000*1.5=$<<20000*1.5=30000>>30,000
So that research cost 45*30,000=$<<45*30000=1350000>>1,350,000

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team based on the information provided.

1. **First Player's Steak:**
   - The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   
2. **Second Player's Beef Tips:**
   - The second player ate beef tips, which contain 8 beef tips, each being 1 ounce.
     \[
     \text{Total ounces from beef tips} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Third Player's Steaks (one pound):**
   - The third player ate a one-pound steak.
     \[
     \text{Conversion from pounds to ounces} = 1 \text{ pound} \times 16 \text{ ounces per pound} = 16 \text{ ounces}
     \]
     
4. **Fourth and Fifth Players' Vegetarian Meals:**
   - The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.
  
5. **Calculate Total Ounces of Meat Consumed:**
   - Sum up all the ounces of meat consumed by the team.
   - First player: 6 ounces
   - Second player: 8 ounces
   - Third player: 16 ounces
   - Fourth player: 0 ounces
   - Fifth player: 0 ounces
   
\[
\text{Total ounces of meat} = 6 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 30 \text{ ounces}

                    question:
                    A Reddit group has 1000 members. If each ! member posts ? an average of 3 posts per ; day, what's the total number of posts that the ! group will have in March?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days in March
March typically has 31 days.

### Step 2: Determine the number of days each member posts on average
Since we don't know how many days each member posts on average, we'll assume they post every day. This means each member posts for the entire month (31 days).

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of posts from one member
Each member posts 3 times per day. Therefore, if there are 31 days in March, then each member would post:
\[ \text{Posts per member} = 3 \times 31 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of posts from all members
There are 1000 members in the group. So, the total number of posts is:
\[ \text{Total posts} = \text{Posts per member} \times \text{Number of members} \]
\[ \text{Total posts} = (3 \times 31) \times 1000 \]

### Step 5: Perform the calculation
First, calculate the posts per member:
\[ 3 \times 31 = 93 \]

Then multiply by the number of members:
\[ 93 \times 1000 = 93,000 \]

Therefore, the total number of posts in March is:
\[

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Gary spends on water for his laundry over the course of one year. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Water Usage
Gary does laundry twice a week. Each load uses 20 gallons of water.
- Number of loads per week = 2
- Total water usage per week = 2 loads/week × 20 gallons/load = 40 gallons/week

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Water Usage
There are approximately 4 weeks in a month (considering a month has about 4 full weeks).
- Total water usage per month = 40 gallons/week × 4 weeks/month = 160 gallons/month

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Water Usage
There are 12 months in a year.
- Total water usage per year = 160 gallons/month × 12 months/year = 1920 gallons/year

### Step 4: Calculate Cost Per Gallon
Water costs $0.15 per gallon.
- Cost per gallon = $0.15/gallon

### Step 5: Calculate Total Annual Laundry Cost
Total annual cost = Total water usage per year × Cost per gallon
- Total annual cost = 1920 gallons/year × $0.15/gallon = $288/year

### Final Answer
The final answer is:
\boxed{288}<|im_end|>","First multiply the number of times Gary does laundry per week by the number of weeks per year to find how many times he does it in a year: 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = <<2*52=104>>104 loads/year

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats in the auditorium.
- There are 4 rows of seats.
- Each row contains 18 seats.

Total number of seats = Number of rows × Seats per row
\[ \text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 \]
\[ \text{Total seats} = 72 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many seats were occupied by the administrators.
- One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.
- Total seats = 72.

Number of seats occupied by administrators = \( \frac{1}{4} \) of total seats
\[ \text{Seats for administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 \]
\[ \text{Seats for administrators} = 18 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of seats occupied by the administrators from the total to find the remaining seats.
Remaining seats after administrators:
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = \text{Total seats} - \text{Seats for administrators} \]
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 \]
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 54 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
- One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.
- Remaining seats (after administrators) = 54.

Number of seats occupied by parents = \( \frac{1}{3} \) of remaining seats
\[ \text{Seats for parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 \]
\[ \text{Seats for parents} = 18 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of seats occupied by students.
- Students occupy the rest of the seats.
- Remaining seats (after administrators and parents) = 54.

Number of seats occupied by students = Total seats - Seats for administrators - Seats for parents
\[ \text{Seats for students} = \text{Total seats} - (\text{Seats for administrators} + \text{Seats for parents}) \]
\[ \text{Seats for students} = 72 - (18 + 18) \]
\[ \text{Seats for students} = 72 - 36 \]
\[ \text{Seats for students} = 36 \]

Therefore, the number of students who attended the event was **36**.<|im_end|>","There are 4 x 18 = <<4*18=72>>72 seats in the school auditorium.

\[ \text{Total street lights per intersection} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

So, there are **24** street lights per pole in each intersection.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.

There are 4 intersections, so we need to multiply the total number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections:

\[ \text{Total street lights across all intersections} = 24 \times 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the total number of street lights across all intersections is **96**.

### Step 4: Subtract the non-working street lights.

We know that 20 streetlights are not working. To find out how many streetlights are working, we subtract the number of non-working streetlights from the total number of streetlights:

\[ \text{Working street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76 \]

### Conclusion:

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{76}
\]<|im_end|>","If the number of poles at each intersection is 6, and the road has 4 intersections, the total number of poles having street lights is 6*4=<<6*4=24>>24

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to consider the maximum number of plays for each DVD individually.

Step 1: Determine the maximum number of plays for each DVD.
- The first DVD has been played 356 times.
- The second DVD has been played 135 times.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plays for both DVDs together.
- Since the DVDs can play up to 1000 times each before breaking, we add their individual maximum plays together.

\[ \text{Total plays} = 356 + 135 \]

Step 3: Perform the addition.
\[ 356 + 135 = 491 \]

Therefore, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 491.

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of the physical therapy sessions, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of session times**
John goes to physical therapy twice every week.

- Number of weeks = 6
- Sessions per week = 2
- Total number of session times = Weeks * Sessions/Week = 6 * 2 = 12

**Step 2: Determine the duration of each session**
Each session lasts for 2 hours.

- Duration of one session = 2 hours

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours spent in sessions**
Total number of hours = Session Times * Hours per Session = 12 * 2 = 24 hours

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost**
Cost per hour = $125

Total cost = Hours * Cost per Hour = 24 * $125

**Step 5: Perform the multiplication**
\[ \text{Total cost} = 24 \times 125 = 3000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy was **$3000**.<|im_end|>","Each week he did 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 hours of physical therapy

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of sticks chewed during the school day.
- Jim chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours at school.
- His school day lasts 8 hours.

To find out how many times he chews during this period:
\[ \text{Number of chewing sessions} = \frac{\text{Total hours}}{\text{Hours per session}} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \]

So, Jim chews \( 4 \) times during the school day.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of pieces of gum chewed during the school day.
Since he chews 1 piece of gum each time, the total number of pieces chewed during the school day is:
\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \]

### Step 3: Add the pieces of gum chewed on the way home from school.
Jim chews an additional 1 piece of gum on the way back from school.

### Step 4: Add the pieces of gum chewed after dinner.
Jim chews another 1 piece of gum after dinner.

### Step 5: Sum up all the pieces of gum chewed during the entire day.
\[ \text{Total pieces chewed} = (4 + 1 + 1) = 6 \]

### Step 6: Subtract the pieces of gum given away to his sister.
Jim gives half of what remains to his sister, so we need to subtract these from the total pieces chewed:
\[ \text{Pieces remaining after giving away} = 6 - \left(\frac{6}{2}\right) = 6 - 3 = 3 \]

### Final Answer:
Jim has **3** pieces of gum left at the end of the day.<|im_end|>","Jim goes to school for 8 hours, so if he chews 1 stick of gum every 2 hours that means he chews 8/2= <<8/2=4>>4 sticks of gum
Jim chews 1 stick on the way home, plus 2 sticks after dinner for a total of 1+1=2 sticks of gum
His sister asks for half his remaining gum. Jim started with 20 and has chewed 6, so he has 20-6=<<20-6=14>>14 sticks left
This means Jim gives her 14/2=<<14/2=7>>7 sticks of gum
Jim had 20 sticks of gum to begin with, and gave away 4+2+7=13 sticks away
This means Jim has 20-13= <<20-13=7>>7 sticks of gum remaining.

To determine Charmaine's age 4 years from now, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Charmaine's current age:**
   - We know that in 12 years, Charmaine will be 16 years old.
   - To find her current age, subtract 12 from 16.

\[
\text{Current Age} = 16 \text{ (in 12 years) } - 12 \text{ (years passed)} = 4 \text{ years}
\]

2. **Calculate Charmaine's age 4 years from now:**
   - Since we have determined her current age to be 4 years, add 4 more years to this value.

\[
\text{Age 4 Years From Now} = 4 \text{ (current age)} + 4 \text{ (additional years)} = 8 \text{ years}
\]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - By adding 4 more years to her current age, we can confirm that Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach separately and then find the difference between these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach
- Baseball coach bought 9 baseballs.
- Each baseball costs $3.

\[
\text{Total cost for baseball} = \text{Number of baseballs} \times \text{Cost per baseball}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for baseball} = 9 \times 3 = 27
\]

So, the baseball coach spent $27 in total.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach
- Basketball coach bought 8 basketballs.
- Each basketball costs $14.

\[
\text{Total cost for basketball} = \text{Number of basketballs} \times \text{Cost per basketball}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for basketball} = 8 \times 14 = 112
\]

So, the basketball coach spent $112 in total.

### Step 3: Determine the difference in spending
Now, subtract the total amount spent by the baseball coach from the total amount spent by the basketball coach:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost for basketball} - \text{Total cost for baseball}
\]

Substitute the calculated values:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 27 = 85
\]

### Final Answer
The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. 

\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 85}
\]<|im_end|>","The cost of the baseballs is 9 × $3 = $<<9*3=27>>27.

### Step 2: Determine how many flowers have bloomed.
We know that only \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed.

\[
\text{Bloomed flowers} = \left( \frac{4}{5} \right) \times \text{Total number of flowers}

To solve this problem, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabytes per hour (Mb/h). Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Convert Kilobits Per Second (kb/s) to Megabits Per Hour (Mb/h)
First, we'll calculate the total amount of data transferred in bytes per hour.

- Given: \(20 \text{ kb/s}\)

Convert the speed into megabits per hour:

\[
1 \text{ mb} = 8 \text{ kbit}
\]

So,

\[
20 \text{ kb/s} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 72000 \text{ kbit/hour}
\]

Now, convert kbit to mb:

\[
72000 \text{ kbit/hour} \div 8 \text{ kbit/megabyte} = 9000 \text{ mb/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Conclusion
Ashley's internet connection speed is \(9000\) megabytes per hour.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                    On a particular ! week, a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days and then four fewer cars on each ! of the remaining days of the week. Calculate the total number of cars it towed that week.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and calculate the total number of cars towed over the entire week.

### Step 1: Determine the number of cars towed per day in the first three days.
- The problem states that a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days.

\[ \text{Cars per day (first three days)} = 10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cars towed in the first three days.
- Since there are three days in the first part of the week:

\[ \text{Total cars (first three days)} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of cars towed per day in the remaining days of the week.
- After the first three days, the number of cars towed decreased by four on each subsequent day.

### Step 4: Calculate the number of remaining days in the week.
- There are seven days in a week, so after the first three days, there are:

\[ \text{Remaining days} = 7 - 3 = 4 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of cars towed per day in the last four days.
- For the remaining four days, the number of cars towed was reduced by four from the previous day's count.

For example:
- Day 4: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) cars
- Day 5: \( 6 - 4 = 2 \) cars
- Day 6: \( 2 - 4 = -2 \) cars (not possible since we can't have negative cars)
- Day 7: No cars were towed on this day.

Since it doesn't make sense to have negative or zero cars towed on any day, let's adjust our approach.

### Step 6: Adjust the calculation based on realistic constraints.
Given that the problem asks for a reasonable interpretation of the scenario, let’s assume the decrease is consistent across all days, but realistically, if we cannot tow cars on some days, we should consider the maximum feasible reduction within the context provided.

Let’s re-evaluate under these constraints.

### Step 7: Re-calculate using a more practical approach.
Assume the reduction only applies consistently without going into negative values. Let's assume the reduction happens as described but not exceeding the original capacity.

For simplicity, let's say the reduction follows linearly until no further reduction can be applied.

### Step 8: Final Calculation.
- If we apply the reduction correctly, the pattern might look like:
    - Day 1: 10 cars
    - Day 2: 6 cars (since 10 - 4 = 6)
    - Day 3: 2 cars (since 6 - 4 = 2)
    - Day 4: 0 cars (since 2 - 4 = -2, which is not valid)

So, effectively, we can't reduce beyond the initial 10 cars because it would result in a negative value.

Therefore, the total number of cars towed during the week is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","On the first three days, towing ten cars a day, the tow truck pulled 3*10 = <<3*10=30>>30 cars.
It pulled four fewer cars each day, which is 10-4 = <<10-4=6>>6 cars on the remaining days.
If it pulled ten cars for three days and four less on the remaining days, then it pulled for 7-3 = 4 days, four cars less each day.
For the four days, the car pulled 6*4= <<6*4=24>>24 cars.
The total number of cars it pulled that week is 24+30 = <<24+30=54>>54 cars.

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many years it will take for Adam to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's current height from inches to feet:**
   - Adam's current height is 40 inches.
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we divide his height by 12:
     \[
     \text{Adam's current height (in feet)} = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.\overline{3} \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine Adam's target height in feet:**
   - The roller coaster requires riders to be exactly 4 feet tall.

3. **Calculate the additional height needed:**
   - Subtract Adam's current height from the required height:
     \[
     \text{Additional height needed} = 4 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Determine how much Adam needs to grow per year:**
   - Adam grows 2 inches every year.
   - Convert this growth into feet per year:
     \[
     \text{Growth rate (per year)} = \frac{2 \text{ inches/year}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of years needed to achieve the required growth:**
   - Divide the additional height needed by the annual growth rate:
     \[
     \text{Years needed} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} \text{ feet}}{\frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year}} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = 4 \text{ years}
     \]

Therefore, it will take Adam **4 years** to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.<|im_end|>","Adam needs to grow 8 inches because 48 -40= <<48-40=8>>8

To determine how much James made from his car sales, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.
James sold 10 cars at $25,000 each.

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine the acquisition cost for each car.
The company pays 30% of the original purchase price to acquire the cars.

\[
\text{Acquisition Cost per Car} = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500
\]

Since James sold 10 cars, the total acquisition cost will be:

\[
\text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times \$7,500 = \$75,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the profit from selling the cars.
Profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue and the total acquisition cost.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Acquisition Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the commission James receives based on the profits.

                    Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a ; big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay ; upright on the wave?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave**

Given:
- Total number of riders = 100

When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 25\% \times 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \]

So, **25 riders can stay upright on the wave**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of women among those who can stay upright**

Of these 25 riders, 60% are women.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Number of women} = 60\% \times 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \]

So, **15 riders are women**, leaving **10 men to be counted as riders who can stay upright**.

Therefore, **the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10**.

Final Answer:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Sure! Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the Price of the Gold Jewel
Given that the price of the gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of the diamond jewel, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship:

Let \( D \) be the price of the diamond jewel. According to the problem, \( D = \$2000 \).

Therefore,
\[ G = \frac{4}{5}D \]

Substitute \( D \):
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 \]
\[ G = 1600 \]

So, the price of the gold jewel is \( \$1600 \).

### Step 2: Determine the Price of the Silver Jewel
The problem states that the cost of the silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. We already know the price of the gold jewel is \( \$1600 \), so let's denote the price of the silver jewel as \( S \):

\[ S = G - 400 \]
\[ S = 1600 - 400 \]
\[ S = 1200 \]

So, the price of the silver jewel is \( \$1200 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Price for All Three Jewels
Now, we need to calculate the total price for the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

- Diamond Jewel: \( \$2000 \)
- Gold Jewel: \( \$1600 \)
- Silver Jewel: \( \$1200 \)

Total price:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 \]
\[ \text{Total Price} = 4800 \]

### Final Answer
The total price for all three jewels is \( \$4800 \).<|im_end|>","If a diamond Jewellcosts $2000, the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5*$2000 = $1600

The price of the three jewels combined is $1200+$1600+$2000 = $<<1200+1600+2000=4800>>4800

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's define variables to represent the number of stamps for each design:
- Let \( S \) be the number of snowflake stamps.
- Let \( T \) be the number of truck stamps.
- Let \( R \) be the number of rose stamps.

From the problem statement:
- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, so \( S = 16 \).

### Step 2: Express Truck Stamps in Terms of Snowflake Stamps
According to the problem, Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps:
\[ T = S + 3 \]
Substituting \( S = 16 \):
\[ T = 16 + 3 = 19 \]

### Step 3: Express Rose Stamps in Terms of Truck Stamps
Similarly, Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps:
\[ R = T - 9 \]
Substituting \( T = 19 \):
\[ R = 19 - 9 = 10 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Number of Stamps
Now we can find the total number of stamps by adding up all the different types:
\[ \text{Total} = S + T + R \]
Substituting the values we found:
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 19 + 10 \]

### Step 5: Perform the Addition
Performing the addition:
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]<|im_end|>","Max bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.

                    question:
                    Bob is 75 miles ! ahead of Tom, driving 55 miles per hour. Tom is driving 70 miles per hour. How long will it take Tom to catch up with Bob?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the relative speed between Tom and Bob:**
   - Bob is driving at 55 mph.
   - Tom is driving at 70 mph.
   
   The difference in their speeds (relative speed) is \(70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}\).

2. **Calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the gap:**
   - Bob is initially 75 miles behind Tom.
   - To find out how long it will take Tom to cover this distance at his relative speed of 15 mph.

   We use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Verify the solution:**
   - If Tom drives at 70 mph for 5 hours, he covers \(70 \times 5 = 350\) miles.
   - Bob has been traveling for 5 hours at 55 mph, so he covers \(55 \times 5 = 275\) miles.
   - Therefore, the remaining distance between them is \(75 - 275 = -200\) miles (Bob is now behind Tom), but since they started from different points, the correct interpretation should be that Tom closes the gap after covering 350 miles and then overtakes Bob.

Thus, the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob is \(\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}\).<|im_end|>","Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour to Bob's 55 miles per hour, meaning Tom is gaining at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = <<70-55=15>>15 mph.

Step 2: Determine how many fish Tommy caught.
Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we can calculate this as follows:
\[ \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \]

Therefore, Tommy caught **14** fish.

To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents stop signing him up, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost per class**: The cost per class is given as $60.
2. **Determine the maximum allowed cost**: Manny's parents will not sign him up again if the total cost exceeds $10 per class. Therefore, the maximum allowable total cost is $10 per class multiplied by the number of classes.
3. **Calculate the maximum total cost**: Since there are 10 classes, the maximum total cost is \(10 \times \$10 = \$100\).
4. **Subtract the initial cost from the maximum total cost**: Manny has already paid $60 towards the classes. We need to find out how much additional money he can spend without exceeding $10 per class.
5. **Divide the remaining budget by the cost per class**: To find out how many classes Manny can afford, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per class. 
   \[
   \frac{\$60}{\$60} = 1 \text{ class}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers both Julie and Jewel can process together in one week.

1. **Determine Julie's processing speed**:
   - We know that Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie works at exactly twice the speed of Jewel.
   
2. **Calculate Julie's daily processing rate**:
   Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day and Julie processes twice as fast, Julie will process \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers per day.

3. **Calculate total weekly processing for Julie**:
   - Julie works every day of the week (7 days).
   - Therefore, in one week, Julie will process \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

4. **Calculate total weekly processing for Jewel**:
   - Jewel also works every day of the week (7 days).
   - Therefore, in one week, Jewel will process \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per apple and per orange first. Then, we can use these prices to calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

Step 1: Determine the price per apple.
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Therefore, one apple costs \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \).

Step 2: Determine the price per orange.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- Therefore, one orange costs \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \).

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 5 apples.
- Since one apple costs $1.30, five apples will cost \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \).

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 5 oranges.
- Since one orange costs $1.10, five oranges will cost \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \).

Step 5: Add the costs together to find the total amount Clyde will pay.
- The total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \).

Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior ; light package.  The base price of the truck ! is $30,000, and the other features ? are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to account for all the additional features he wants to add. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Base Price**: 
   - Base price of the truck = $30,000

2. **King Cab Upgrade**:
   - King Cab Upgrade cost = $7,500

3. **Running Boards**:
   - Running Boards cost = Leather Seats cost - $500
     - Since the king cab upgrade costs $7,500 (which is three times the leather seats), let’s denote the leather seat cost as \(L\).
     - Therefore, \(7,500 = 3 \times L\) → \(L = \frac{7,500}{3} = \$2,500\)
     - Running Boards cost = \(L - 500 = 2,500 - 500 = \$2,000\)

4. **Towing Package**:
   - Towing Package cost is not explicitly given but assumed to be part of the base price or can be considered an additional feature.

5. **Exterior Light Package**:
   - Exterior Light Package cost = $1500

Now, let's calculate the total cost:

- King Cab Upgrade: $7,500
- Leather Seats: $2,500
- Running Boards: $2,000
- Tow Truck Package (Assumed part of the base): $0 (since it's not explicitly stated and could be included in the base price)
- Exterior Light Package: $1500

Adding these together:

\[ Total Cost = Base Price + King Cab Upgrade + Leather Seats + Running Boards + Tow Truck Package + Exterior Light Package \]
\[ Total Cost = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 0 + 1,500 \]

Let's sum these up:

\[ Total Cost = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 \]
\[ Total Cost = 43,500 \]

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $\boxed{43,500}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, at a cost of $7,500/3=$<<7500/3=2500>>2500.

                    question:
                    Tim gets a promotion that offers him a 5% raise on his $20000 a month salary.  It also ? gives him a bonus worth half a month's salary. How much money will he make in a year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Tim will earn in a year after receiving both a raise and a bonus, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the raise amount:**
   - Tim’s current monthly salary is $20,000.
   - He receives a 5% raise.
   - Raise = 5% of $20,000.

\[
\text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
\]

2. **Add the raise to his original salary:**
   - New monthly salary after the raise.

\[
\text{New Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
\]

3. **Determine the size of the bonus:**
   - The bonus is half of his new monthly salary.
   - Bonus = Half of $21,000.

\[
\text{Bonus} = \frac{21000}{2} = 10500
\]

4. **Calculate the total monthly earnings including the raise and bonus:**
   - Total monthly earnings = New salary + Bonus.

\[
\text{Total Monthly Earnings} = 21000 + 10500 = 31500
\]

5. **Calculate the annual earnings:**
   - Multiply the total monthly earnings by 12 (months in a year).

\[
\text{Annual Earnings} = 31500 \times 12 = 378000
\]

### Conclusion:
Tim will earn a total of $378,000 in a year after receiving his raise and bonus.<|im_end|>","The promotion increased his monthly salary by 20000*.05=$<<20000*0.05=1000>>1000

                    question:
                    James buys a new wardrobe.  He buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants. .  He also buys 3 dress shirts per suit.  The suits cost $750 each and ; the dress pants cost 1/5 that cost.  The dress shirts were $60 each.  How much ; did : everything cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the total cost of everything James bought, we need to calculate the cost for each item separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits
- Number of suits = 10
- Cost per suit = $750

\[
\text{Total cost for suits} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Cost per suit}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for suits} = 10 \times 750 = \$7500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants
- Number of dress pants = 10
- Cost per dress pant = \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the suit price

First, find the cost of one dress pant:

\[
\text{Cost of one dress pant} = \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = \$150
\]

Now, multiply this by the number of dress pants:

\[
\text{Total cost for dress pants} = \text{Number of dress pants} \times \text{Cost per dress pant}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = \$1500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts
- Number of dress shirts per suit = 3
- Cost per dress shirt = $60

\[
\text{Total cost for dress shirts per suit} = \text{Number of dress shirts per suit} \times \text{Cost per dress shirt}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for dress shirts per suit} = 3 \times 60 = \$180
\]

Since there are 10 suits, multiply this by the number of suits:

\[
\text{Total cost for dress shirts} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Total cost for dress shirts per suit}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for dress shirts} = 10 \times 180 = \$1800
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for suits} + \text{Total cost for dress pants} + \text{Total cost for dress shirts}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = \$10800
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$10800**.<|im_end|>","The suits cost 750*10=$<<750*10=7500>>7500
The dress pants cost 750/5=$<<750/5=150>>150 each
So in total they cost 150*10=$<<150*10=1500>>1500
He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 dress shirts
so he spends 30*60=$<<30*60=1800>>1800 on dress shirts
Thus the total cost is 7500+1500+1800=$<<7500+1500+1800=10800>>10,800

                    A news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles ! every day. Its sister company publishes an average ! of 10 business news articles daily. Calculate the total number of articles the two websites , published together in February if there are 28 days , in the month.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of articles published by both websites over the course of February.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of articles published by the news website:**
   - The news website publishes 20 political and weather news articles per day.
   - There are 31 days in February (assuming it's not a leap year).
   - Therefore, the total number of articles published by the news website is \( 20 \times 31 \).

\[
20 \times 31 = 620
\]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles published by the sister company:**
   - The sister company publishes 10 business news articles per day.
   - Again, there are 31 days in February.
   - Therefore, the total number of articles published by the sister company is \( 10 \times 31 \).

\[
10 \times 31 = 310
\]

3. **Add the totals from both companies:**

\[
620 + 310 = 930
\]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The total number of articles published by both websites in February is 930.

{The final answer is} 930.<|im_end|>","In February, with 28 days, the political and weather publishing news website produced a total of 28*20=<<28*20=560>>560 articles.
The sister company publishing business news had 10*28=<<10*28=280>>280 articles in February.
In total, the two companies published 280+560=<<280+560=840>>840 articles.

                    question:
                    Steve is 60 years old. His wife : is 4 years older than ? him. Their son is currently half as old as his , mom and their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. How old is Steve's son's wife?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Steve's Age**: 
   - Steve is 60 years old.

2. **Steve's Wife's Age**:
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve.
     \[
     \text{Steve's wife} = \text{Steve's age} + 4 = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Son's Age**:
   - The son is currently half as old as his mother.
     \[
     \text{Son's age} = \frac{\text{Mother's age}}{2}
     \]
   - Let \( S \) be the son's age. We don't know the exact value yet but we can express it in terms of the mother's age \( M \).
     \[
     S = \frac{M}{2}
     \]

4. **Son's Wife's Age**:
   - The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (Steve).
     \[
     \text{Son's wife's age} = \text{Steve's age} - 3 = 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Finding the Son's Wife's Relationship to the Son**:
   - To find out how many times older the son's wife is compared to the son, we need to determine the ratio between the son's wife's age and the son's age.
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Son's wife's age}}{\text{Son's age}} = \frac{57}{S}
     \]
   - Since the son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, we can also say that she is \( \frac{S-3}{S} \) times older than the son.
     \[
     \frac{S-3}{S} = \frac{57}{S}
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation will give us an expression for the ratio:
     \[
     S - 3 = 57
     \]
     \[
     S = 60
     \]
     This means the son's age is 60, which confirms our previous calculations.

6. **Calculating the Son's Wife's Age**:
   - Now that we know the son's age is 60, we can calculate the son's wife's age using the information that she is 3 years younger than her husband.
     \[
     \text{Son's wife's age} = 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ years old}

To determine how many miles Alisa and Stanley biked in total, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled individually and then sum these distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Alisa biked**

Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour
Time spent biking = 4.5 hours

Distance formula: 
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Plugging in Alisa's values:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \text{ mph} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance Stanley biked**

Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour
Time spent biking = 2.5 hours

Using the same distance formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 2.5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Sum the distances**

Total distance = Distance_alisa + Distance_stanley
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \text{ miles} + 25 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Alisa and Stanley biked a total of **79 miles**.<|im_end|>","Alisa = 12 * 4.5 = <<12*4.5=54>>54 miles

<|im_start|>super
To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time required for both digging through soil and digging through clay separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to dig through soil
Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
Total length of soil = 24 feet
Time to dig through soil = Total length of soil / Digging speed through soil
\[ \text{Time to dig through soil} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to dig through clay
Bill digs at half the speed through clay compared to soil. Therefore, his speed through clay is:
\[ \text{Speed through clay} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \text{ feet/hour} = 2 \text{ feet/hour} \]
Total length of clay = 8 feet
Time to dig through clay = Total length of clay / Speed through clay
\[ \text{Time to dig through clay} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 3: Sum up the total time
Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
\[ \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ hours}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total number of people**:
   - Howie has 25 classmates.
   - Including himself, that makes a total of \(25 + 1 = 26\) people.

2. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes needed**:
   - Each person should have at least one cupcake.
   - Therefore, Howie needs to buy enough cupcakes for all 26 people.

3. **Consider the distribution of cupcakes**:
   - Howie decides to buy one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake per person.
   - This means he buys an additional 24 cupcakes (one for each of the 26 people).

4. **Account for the extra cupcakes for himself and his teacher**:
   - His teacher also receives a cupcake.
   - So, he adds another 1 more cupcake for himself.

5. **Sum up the total number of cupcakes**:
   - Total cupcakes needed: \(26 \text{ (for classmates)} + 24 \text{ (extra for others)} + 1 \text{ (for teacher)}\)

Therefore, Howie should buy a total of \(26 + 24 + 1 = 51\) cupcakes.

- Number of likes after one week = 2000 (initial) + 2000 (additional) = 4000
- Number of likes after two weeks (three weeks from posting) = 4000 * 7 = 28000

So, at three weeks, Fishio has **28000 likes**.

**Step 2: Determine the increase in likes over time.**

- Increase in likes three weeks after posting = Final number - Initial number = 28000 - 2000 = 26000

This means that over the course of three weeks, Fishio gained an additional 26000 likes.

**Step 3: Find out how many likes were added recently to reach the current count.**

- Current number of likes = 28000
- Additional likes recently = Current number - Previous number = 28000 - 26000 = 2000

Therefore, Fishio received **2000 more recent likes**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is the total number of likes Fishio currently has, which is **28000 plus the 2000 recent likes**, making the total **30000 likes**.<|im_end|>","After receiving 2000 likes on her photo on Instagram on the first week, Fishio received 70*2000 = <<70*2000=140000>>140000 new likes on the photo after three more weeks.

                    question:
                    On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. At the till she got $2 off because she had a voucher. The next day, the price shot to $30 per fruit, but the store also offered a 10% discount on the total cost. Sheila took advantage of the discount and bought 20 pomegranates. What is the ! difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the final price Clara and Sheila paid for the pomegranates on their respective days and then find the difference between these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Clara's final price on Tuesday
Clara initially bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each without any discounts.
- Cost before voucher: \( 20 \times 20 = \$400 \)
- She received a $2 off voucher.
- Final price after voucher: \( 400 - 2 = \$398 \)

### Step 2: Calculate Clara's final price on Wednesday
On Wednesday, the price increased to $30 per fruit.
- Number of fruits: 20
- Total cost before discount: \( 30 \times 20 = \$600 \)
- There was no voucher or additional discount on Wednesday.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in price between the two days
- Difference in price: \( |398 - 600| = \$202 \)

Thus, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $\boxed{202}$.<|im_end|>","On Tuesday, the pomegranates cost Clara 20 pomegranates * $20/pomegranates = $<<20*20=400>>400

On Wednesday, the pomegranates cost Sheila 20 pomegranates * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600.
She then got a discount of 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60
Sheila ended up paying $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540
The difference is therefore $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142

                    question:
                    Ariadne has a ? shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. .

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount Ariadne made in the first month.
2. Calculate the total amount she made in the second month based on the given ratio.
3. Add the amounts from both months to find the total.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the total amount Ariadne made in the first month

We know that the sales from red hats (which are $400) represent half the total amount from green hats. Let's denote the total amount from green hats as \( G \).

Given:
\[ \text{Sales from red hats} = \$400 \]
\[ \text{Sales from green hats} = 2 \times \text{Sales from red hats} \]

So,
\[ G = 2 \times \$400 = \$800 \]

Now, let's find out the total amount she made in the first month (\( T_1 \)):

\[ T_1 = \text{Sales from red hats} + \text{Sales from green hats} \]
\[ T_1 = \$400 + \$800 \]
\[ T_1 = \$1200 \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the total amount she made in the second month

According to the problem, in the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. So, let's calculate it.

Let \( T_2 \) be the total amount made in the second month. Then:
\[ T_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times T_1 \]

Substitute \( T_1 \):
\[ T_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times \$1200 \]
\[ T_2 = \$900 \]

#### Step 3: Find the total amount she made over two months

Finally, add the sales from both months to get the total amount:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = T_1 + T_2 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$1200 + \$900 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \$2100 \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\$2100}
\]<|im_end|>","Since the total sales of red hats were half that of green hats in the first month, she made 2*$400=$<<2*400=800>>800 from green hats.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage ride, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent:**
   - The ride starts at 5 PM and ends at 9 PM.
   - Total duration = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Determine the number of paid hours:**
   - James gets 1 hour free.
   - Number of paid hours = Total hours - Free hours
   - Number of paid hours = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the hourly rate for the paid hours:**
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous one.
   - Hourly rate for the second hour = 2 * $15 = $30.
   - Hourly rate for the third hour = 2 * $30 = $60.

4. **Sum up the costs for all paid hours:**
   - Cost for the first hour = $15.
   - Cost for the second hour = $30.
   - Cost for the third hour = $60.
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $60.

Now let's calculate the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$15 + \$30 + \$60 = \$105
\]

Therefore, the amount James paid for the horse-drawn carriage ride is \boxed{105}.<|im_end|>","He got it for 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4 hours

To determine how much was withheld from Sally's wages, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money taken out of Sally's account:**
   - Start with her initial balance: $200.
   - End balance after receiving the withheld funds: $420.

   \[
   \text{Total withheld} = \text{End balance} - \text{Initial balance}

                    question:
                    Lori needed 1 whole egg ; to make 2 deviled . egg halves.  She anticipates that each of her ; guests will eat 3 deviled ! egg halves.  If she is inviting 16 guests to her party, how : many dozens of eggs will she need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many dozen eggs Lori needs, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed.
Lori wants to serve 2 deviled egg halves per person for 16 guests.

\[
\text{Total deviled egg halves} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Deviled egg halves per guest}
\]

\[
\text{Total deviled egg halves} = 16 \times 2 = 32
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of whole eggs required.
Each deviled egg half requires one whole egg.

\[
\text{Whole eggs needed} = \text{Total deviled egg halves}
\]

\[
\text{Whole eggs needed} = 32
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of dozen eggs needed.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen,

\[
\text{Dozen eggs needed} = \frac{\text{Whole eggs needed}}{12}
\]

\[
\text{Dozen eggs needed} = \frac{32}{12} \approx 2.67
\]

### Final Answer:
Lori will need approximately **2.67 dozen** eggs. Since you can't purchase or use partial dozens of eggs, she would need to round up to ensure she has enough eggs. Therefore, she should order **3 dozen eggs** to cover the entire requirement. 

So, the final answer is:
\boxed{3}<|im_end|>","She is inviting 16 guests that will eat 3 deviled egg halves each so she needs 16*3 =<<16*3=48>>48 halves

Shiela has already written \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 15-page paper.

\[
\text{Pages completed} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15
\]

Step 2: Perform the multiplication.
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5
\]

So, Shiela has completed 5 pages.

Step 3: Subtract the number of pages completed from the total number of pages to find out how many pages are left.
\[
\text{Pages left} = 15 - 5
\]

Step 4: Perform the subtraction.

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost for James to buy and maintain his plane over the first year, we need to calculate both the initial purchase cost and the ongoing maintenance costs.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial Purchase Cost:**
   - The plane itself costs $150,000.
   
2. **Maintenance Costs Per Month:**
   - James pays $5,000 per month for renting a hangar.
   - He spends twice as much on fuel per month.
     \[
     \text{Fuel Cost per Month} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
     \]
   - Total Maintenance Cost Per Month:
     \[
     \text{Total Monthly Maintenance Cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
     \]

3. **Number of Months in One Year:**
   - There are 12 months in one year.

4. **Annual Maintenance Cost:**
   - Multiply the monthly maintenance cost by 12 to find the annual maintenance cost:
     \[
     \text{Annual Maintenance Cost} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
     \]

5. **Total Cost Over the First Year:**
   - Add the initial purchase cost to the annual maintenance cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
     \]

### Conclusion:
The total cost for James to buy and maintain the plane for the first year is \(\boxed{\$330,000}\).<|im_end|>","The fuel cost 5000*2=$<<5000*2=10000>>10000 per month

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Finley spent cooking all the ingredients she bought. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Cooking Time for Rice**: 30 minutes.
2. **Time Difference between Pork and Rice**: 20 minutes (since it takes 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice).
3. **Time Difference between Beans and Combined Pork and Rice**: Half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.

Let's start solving the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Cooking Time for Pork
Since it takes 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, and it already takes 30 minutes to cook rice:
\[ \text{Pork Cooking Time} = \text{Rice Cooking Time} + 20 \]
\[ \text{Pork Cooking Time} = 30 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Pork Cooking Time} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Cooking Time for Beans
Beans take half the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ \text{Combined Cooking Time of Pork and Rice} = \text{Pork Cooking Time} + \text{Rice Cooking Time} \]
\[ \text{Combined Cooking Time of Pork and Rice} = 50 + 30 \]
\[ \text{Combined Cooking Time of Pork and Rice} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, since beans take half this combined time:
\[ \text{Bean Cooking Time} = \frac{\text{Combined Cooking Time of Pork and Rice}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bean Cooking Time} = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ \text{Bean Cooking Time} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Sum Up All Cooking Times
Now that we have the individual times for each ingredient, let’s add them up:
\[ \text{Total Cooking Time} = \text{Rice Cooking Time} + \text{Pork Cooking Time} + \text{Bean Cooking Time} \]
\[ \text{Total Cooking Time} = 30 + 50 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total Cooking Time} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took Finley to cook all the food is **120 minutes**.<|im_end|>","If rice took thirty minutes to cook, pork took 20+30 = <<20+30=50>>50 minutes.

                    ? A pound of almonds costs $10 while a pound of walnuts costs $15. How ! much more does it cost for a mixture of 1/2 pound . almonds and , 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound : almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost difference between two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of mixing 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
- Cost per pound of almonds = $10
- Cost per pound of walnuts = $15

For 1/2 pound of almonds:
\[ \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \]

For 1/3 pound of walnuts:
\[ \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

Total cost for 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 + 5 = 10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of mixing 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
- For 1/5 pound of almonds:
\[ \text{Cost of almonds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \]

- For 1/3 pound of walnuts:
\[ \text{Cost of walnuts} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \]

Total cost for 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 2 + 5 = 7 \]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between the two mixtures.
\[ \text{Difference} = 10 - 7 = 3 \]

Therefore, it costs **more** to mix 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts compared to mixing 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts by $3.<|im_end|>","One-half pound of almonds cost $10/2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.
One-fifth pound of almonds cost $10/5 = $<<10/5=2>>2.
A one-third pound of walnuts costs $15/3 = $<<15/3=5>>5.
So, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $5 + $5 = $10.
And 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $2 + $5 = $7.
Therefore, 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost $10 - $7 = $3 more than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

                    . Lee rears , only sheep ? and geese on his farm.  If the total number of animal legs is 70, and the total number of animal heads is 20, how many sheep live on Lee's ? farm?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm given the information about the total number of animal legs and heads.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep.
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of geese.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - Each sheep has 4 legs.
   - Each goose has 2 legs.
   - The total number of animal legs is 70.
   - The total number of animal heads is 20.

From these, we can write two equations:

\[
4S + 2G = 70 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

\[
S + G = 20 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

3. **Solve for Sheep (\( S \)) using Equation 2:**

Substitute \( G \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

\[
4S + 2(G) = 70
\]

\[
4S + 2(20 - S) = 70
\]

\[
4S + 40 - 2S = 70
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2S + 40 = 70
\]

Subtract 40 from both sides:

\[
2S = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
S = 15
\]

Therefore, there are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{15}\).<|im_end|>","Let g be the number of geese and let s be the number of sheep. The farm has g + s = 20 animals.
Therefore Lee has s = 20 - g sheep.
The animals have 2g + 4s = 70 legs.
Using the value of s above, 2g + 4(20-g) = 70.
2g + 80 - 4g = 70.
2g = 10.
There are therefore 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 geese.
There are 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 sheep remaining on the farm.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine the total cost of everything Roger bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price increase due to the more expensive brand:**
   - The normal price of the coffee is $5 per pound.
   - The increased price is 20% higher than the original price.

2. **Determine the new price per pound after the increase:**
   \[
   \text{Increased Price} = \text{Normal Price} + (\text{Normal Price} \times \text{Increase Percentage})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Price} = \$5 + ( \$5 \times 0.20 )
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Price} = \$5 + \$1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Increased Price} = \$6
   \]

3. **Calculate how many pounds of coffee Roger needs in a week:**
   - Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day for one week,
   \[
   \text{Total Pounds Needed} = 7 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ pound/day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Pounds Needed} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee:**
   - The total amount of money spent on coffee is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Coffee} = \text{Pounds Needed} \times \text{Price per Pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Coffee} = \$42
   \]

5. **Add the cost of the donuts:**
   - Roger spends an additional $2 on donuts.
   \[
   \text{Total Donut Cost} = \$2
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Coffee} + \text{Donut Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$42 + \$2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$44

                    Gus : spent $20.00 at the grocery store.  He bought ! 2 bag of chips for $2.00 each, a : bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 ? and a bottle of soda for $1.00.  How much did the apple pie cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Gus spent on apples and then subtract that amount from his total spending. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought.
- Chips: 2 bags at $2.00 each
  \[
  2 \times \$2.00 = \$4.00
  \]
- Fried Chicken: $8.00
- Soda: $1.00
  
Adding these up gives us the total cost of all other items:
\[
\$4.00 + \$8.00 + \$1.00 = \$13.00
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the total cost of other items from the total amount spent.
Gus spent a total of $20.00.

Subtracting the cost of the other items ($13.00) from the total ($20.00):
\[
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
\]

Therefore, the cost of the apple pie is:
{The final answer is} \$7.00.<|im_end|>","He bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each so they cost 2*2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00

To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Newspapers Delivered**: James delivers a total of 600 newspapers per day.

2. **Newspapers Delivered to Districts A and C**:
   - District A: 198 newspapers.
   - District C: 209 newspapers.

3. **Calculate Total Newspapers Delivered to Districts A and C**:
   \[

<|im_start|>subject
To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of class hours John attends.
2. Determine how many new recipes John can learn based on the total class hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate Total Class Hours
John takes classes four times a week for six weeks. Each class lasts two hours. Therefore, the total number of class hours is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total class hours} = (\text{Number of classes per week}) \times (\text{Hours per class}) \times (\text{Weeks})
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Total class hours} = (4) \times (2) \times (6)
\]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[
4 \times 2 = 8
\]
\[
8 \times 6 = 48
\]

So, John attends a total of 48 hours of class.

#### Step 2: Determine Number of Recipes Learned
John learns one new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the rate at which he learns a new recipe:
\[
\text{Number of recipes learned} = \frac{\text{Total class hours}}{\text{Rate of learning}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Number of recipes learned} = \frac{48}{1.5}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[
48 \div 1.5 = 32
\]

Therefore, John learns a total of 32 new recipes.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of history teachers
- We know that 60% of the teachers are history teachers.
- The total number of teachers is 150.

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) \times 150
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 90
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of math teachers
- Since the remaining percentage (40%) must be math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers
- Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours per day.

\[
\text{Total sleep time for all math teachers} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times 6
\]

Substituting our value:

\[
\text{Total sleep time for all math teachers} = 60 \times 6
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total sleep time for all math teachers} = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is **360 hours**.<|im_end|>","The total number of teachers in the basketball court who teaches history is 60/100*150 = <<60/100*150=90>>90

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down this problem into steps:

**Step 1: Determine Kassidy's amount**

Given that Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much money as Aurelia and Aurelia has $120.

\[
Kassidy's\ Money = \frac{3}{4} \times Aurelia's\ Money
\]

Substitute Aurelia's money:

\[
Kassidy's\ Money = \frac{3}{4} \times 120
\]

Calculate:

\[
Kassidy's\ Money = 90
\]

So, Kassidy has $90.

**Step 2: Determine Rayna's amount**

Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy.

\[
Rayna's\ Money = Kassidy's\ Money + 60
\]

Substitute Kassidy's money:

\[
Rayna's\ Money = 90 + 60
\]

Calculate:

\[
Rayna's\ Money = 150
\]

So, Rayna has $150.

**Step 3: Calculate total money**

Add up all three amounts (Aurelia, Kassidy, and Rayna).

\[
Total\ Money = Aurelia's\ Money + Kassidy's\ Money + Rayna's\ Money
\]

Substitute the values we found:

\[
Total\ Money = 120 + 90 + 150
\]

Calculate:

\[
Total\ Money = 360
\]

So, the total amount of money they have together is $360.

**Step 4: Share equally**

Now, divide the total money equally among the three.

\[
Each\ Person's\ Amount = \frac{Total\ Money}{Number\ of\ People}
\]

Substitute the numbers:

\[
Each\ Person's\ Amount = \frac{360}{3}
\]

Calculate:

\[
Each\ Person's\ Amount = 120
\]

Therefore, after sharing equally, each person will have $120.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is $\boxed{120}$.<|im_end|>","Since Arelia has $120, and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money Arelia, Kassidy has 3/4*$120 = $<<3/4*120=90>>90

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of candy:**
   - Robert has 3 pounds.
   - Cindy has 5 pounds.
   - Aaron has 4 pounds.

   Adding these together gives us the total amount of candy:
   \[
   3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Divide the total amount of candy equally among all three friends:**
   There are 3 people sharing the candy equally.

   To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds per person}
   \]

Therefore, each of them would have \(4\) pounds of candy if they decided to pool and share it equally.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(4\).<|im_end|>","Robert had 3 pounds of candy, Cindy had 5 pounds of candy, and Aaron had 4 pounds of candy which equals 3 + 5 + 4 = <<3+5+4=12>>12 pounds of candy

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much change Adam received after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candies.
Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.

- The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5.
  
  - Cost for 7 candies of type A:
    \[
    7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \text{ dollars}
    \]

- The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.
  
  - Cost for 10 candies of type B:
    \[
    10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
    \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total cost of all candies.
\[
3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from what Adam paid.
Adam paid the cashier $15.
\[
15 - 11 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of change Adam received is **$4**.<|im_end|>","For type A candies Adam needed to pay 7 * 0.5 = $<<7*0.5=3.5>>3.5.
For the other type of candies, Adam needed to pay 10 * 0.75 = $<<10*0.75=7.5>>7.5.
So Adam had to pay 3.5 + 7.5 = $<<3.5+7.5=11>>11 in total for his shopping.
If Adam gave the cashier $15, that means he got 15 - 11 = $<<15-11=4>>4 of change.

   - Good days (G): 12
   - Bad days (B): 8
   - Neutral days (N): The remaining days after subtracting G and B from total days.

2. **Calculate Neutral Days**:
   \[

   - Bad days (B): 8 (initial) + 1 (day 10) = 9
   - Neutral days (N): 10 (already calculated)

6. **Final Count**:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Sally has based on the information given about Janey's book count.

Step 1: Define variables.
Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sally has.

Step 2: Express Janey’s book count in terms of Sally’s books.
Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. This can be written as:
\[ J = 2S + 3 \]

Step 3: Substitute the known value for Janey's books into the equation.
We know that Janey has 21 books, so substitute \( J = 21 \):
\[ 21 = 2S + 3 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( S \).
First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 21 - 3 = 2S \]
\[ 18 = 2S \]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ \frac{18}{2} = S \]
\[ 9 = S \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

**Final Answer:** Sally has 9 books.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of books that Sally has

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many days it will take for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo plant to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the current height from feet to inches:**
   - Given that there are 12 inches in one foot.
   - The bamboo is currently 20 feet tall.

\[
20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches}
\]

2. **Calculate the total increase needed in inches:**
   - The bamboo needs to reach 600 inches, but it already stands at 240 inches.
   
\[
600 \text{ inches (desired)} - 240 \text{ inches (current)} = 360 \text{ inches (increase needed)}
\]

3. **Determine the growth rate per day:**
   - The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day.

4. **Calculate the number of days required to achieve the desired height:**

\[
\frac{\text{Increase Needed}}{\text{Growth Rate per Day}} = \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}}
\]

5. **Perform the division:**

\[
\frac{360}{30} = 12 \text{ days}
\]

### Conclusion:
It will take **12 days** for Mrs. Jameson’s bamboo plant to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.<|im_end|>","Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, then 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = <<20*12=240>>240 inches.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the initial amounts invested by each person.

Total amount invested = $1200

- **Dylan's Investment**:
    - Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
    - Amount Dylan invested = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 \)
    - Calculate this value:
        \[
        \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
        \]
    
- **Frances' Investment**:
    - Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.
    - Remaining amount after Dylan's investment = Total amount - Dylan's investment
    - Amount left after Dylan's investment = \( 1200 - 480 \)
    - Calculate the remaining amount:
        \[
        1200 - 480 = 720
        \]
    - Amount Frances invested = \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
    - Amount Frances invested = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 720 \)
    - Calculate this value:
        \[
        \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
        \]

- **Skyler's Investment**:
    - The rest goes to Skyler.
    - Amount left after Frances' investment = Total amount - (Dylan's + Frances') investments
    - Calculate the remaining amount:
        \[
        1200 - (480 + 480) = 1200 - 960 = 240
        \]
    - This remaining amount is what Skyler invested.

### Step 3: Find out how many additional signatures the sisters still need to collect.
Subtract the current total signatures from the goal.

Additional signatures needed = Total signatures needed - Current total signatures

To determine how much Karen earns in two days, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Karen's hourly wage**
- Lorie earns $10 per hour.
- Karen earns twice what Lorie earns.

\[
\text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \text{Lorie's hourly wage}
\]

\[
\text{Karen's hourly wage} = 2 \times \$10 = \$20
\]

**Step 2: Determine Karen's daily earnings**
- Karen works for 3 hours per day.

\[
\text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per day}
\]

\[
\text{Daily earnings} = \$20 \times 3 = \$60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Karen's total earnings over two days**
- Since Karen works every day, her total earnings over two days will be double her daily earnings.

\[
\text{Total earnings over two days} = 2 \times \text{Daily earnings}
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings over two days} = 2 \times \$60 = \$120

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes produce 36 hash browns.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of hash browns per potato:**
   - We know that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.
   - To find out how many hash browns one potato yields, we divide the total number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:
     \[
     \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   
2. **Calculate the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes:**
   - Since each potato produces 6 hash browns, for 96 potatoes, we multiply the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:
     \[
     \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \times 6 = 576

                    question:
                    The ; elevator in Jack's building supports a maximum load of : 700 kg. An adult weighs an . average of 80 kg. If Jack ; rides the elevator ? with 8 other adults, by how much will they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total weight when all occupants ride together:**
   - Each adult weighs approximately 80 kg.
   - There are 9 people (Jack + 8 adults) riding the elevator.

2. **Calculate the total weight for 9 people:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication to find the total weight:**
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 = 720 \, \text{kg}
   \]

4. **Compare the total weight to the elevator's maximum capacity:**
   - Maximum load allowed = 700 kg.
   - Total weight of occupants = 720 kg.

5. **Subtract the maximum load from the total weight to determine if they exceed the limit:**
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Maximum load}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies Max has:**
   - We know that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Max has as \( M \).

According to the information given:
\[ K = M - 5 \]
Since Katarina has 68 cookies:
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]

Now we can solve for \( M \):
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

So, Max has 73 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Summer has:**
   - We know that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
   - Max has 73 cookies.

Let's denote the number of cookies Summer has as \( S \).

According to the information given:
\[ S = M + 23 \]
Since Max has 73 cookies:
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

So, Summer has 96 cookies.

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - We need to find out how many cookies all three (Katarina, Max, and Summer) have together.
   - Katarina has 68 cookies.
   - Max has 73 cookies.
   - Summer has 96 cookies.

Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
\[ Total = K + M + S \]
\[ Total = 68 + 73 + 96 \]

Let's sum these up:
\[ Total = 68 + 73 + 96 \]
\[ Total = 240 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total increase in length:**
   - Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length.
   - The additional length added at the top is 20 cm.

2. **Calculate the original length before extension:**
   Let \( L \) be the original length of the dress.
   
3. **Express the extended length mathematically:**
   - After extending by 50%, the new length becomes \( 1.5L \).
   - Adding an extra 20 cm results in \( 1.5L + 20 \).

4. **Set up the equation based on the final length:**
   According to the problem, the final length after these modifications is 140 cm.
   Therefore,
   \[
   1.5L + 20 = 140
   \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   First, isolate \( 1.5L \):
   \[
   1.5L = 140 - 20
   \]
   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   1.5L = 120
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to find \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Chris to mow the entire lawn using both modes and then combine these times.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Determine the time per half-lawn for each mode.
- **Turtle Mode**: It takes Chris 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the whole lawn. Therefore, it would take him \( \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \) minutes to mow half the lawn.
- **Rabbit Mode**: It takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the whole lawn. Therefore, it would take him \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \) minutes to mow half the lawn.

#### 2. Calculate the total time if he used both modes sequentially.
Since Chris mowed half the lawn in Turtle mode first, then in Rabbit mode, we add the respective times together:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes (half of Turtle)} + 20 \text{ minutes (half of Rabbit)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

#### Conclusion:
It took Chris a total of 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn by alternating between the two speeds.

To determine how much longer John and Jack need to get to school without being late, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time taken so far:**
   - Time to reach the corner = 6 minutes.
   - Time from the corner to the fire station = 13 minutes.
   
   Total time so far = 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.

2. **Subtract the total time already spent from the total available time:**
   - Total time available = 30 minutes.
   - Time already spent = 19 minutes.
   
   Remaining time = 30 - 19 = 11 minutes.

3. **Determine if they will be on time or not:**
   Since they have exactly 11 minutes left after reaching the fire station, which is less than the remaining time needed (which is also 11 minutes), they will not be able to make it in time.

Therefore, the amount of time they still need to get to school without being late is \boxed{0}.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to define variables for the ages of the twins and triplets, then use the given information to form an equation.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the age of one of the twins.
- \( T + 7 \) as the age of the other twin (since the twins are identical).
- \( t \) as the age of one of the triplets.
- \( t + 3 \) as the age of the other triplet (since the triplets are also identical).

Given that the sum of their ages is 44, we can write the equation:

\[ T + (T + 7) + t + (t + 3) = 44 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ 2T + 10 + 2t = 44 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 2T + 2t = 34 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ T + t = 17 \]

Now we have two equations:

1. \( T + t = 17 \)
2. The combined age of all three individuals: \( T + T + t + t + 7 + 3 = 44 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( t \):

\[ t = 17 - T \]

Substitute \( t \) in the second equation:

\[ T + (T + 7) + (17 - T) + (17 - T + 3) = 44 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ T + T + 7 + 17 - T + 17 - T + 3 = 44 \]
\[ T + 38 = 44 \]

Subtract 38 from both sides:

\[ T = 6 \]

So, the age of one of the twins is **6** years old.<|im_end|>","Let T = age of triplet

To determine how long John needs to nap, let's break down the problem step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on homework:**
   - Math homework: 20 minutes
   - Reading homework: 40 minutes
   - History homework: 20 minutes
   
   Total time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

2. **Convert the remaining time (before dinner) into minutes:**
   - Time before dinner: 3 hours
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 
     3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

3. **Determine the remaining time after accounting for homework:**
   - Total available time: 180 minutes
   - Time spent on homework: 80 minutes
   - Remaining time = 180 - 80 = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes left after finishing his homework.

Therefore, the number of minutes John has to nap is \boxed{100}.<|im_end|>","John has to spend 20+40+20 = <<20+40+20=80>>80 minutes on homework.

                    question:
                    Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies that cost . $3.20. If each lollipop costs $0.40, how much will 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost him?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for one lollipop.
Manolo bought five lollipops and the total cost was $3.20.

\[ \text{Cost per lollipop} = \frac{\$3.20}{5} \]

Calculate the cost per lollipop:

\[
\text{Cost per lollipop} = \$0.64
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for ten lollipops.
Now we need to find out how much ten lollipops would cost.

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 lollipops} = 10 \times \$0.64
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 lollipops} = \$6.40
\]

### Step 3: Determine the cost per candy.
We know that each lollipop costs $0.40. Since there are five lollipops, we can determine the cost per candy based on the information given in the question.

Given that each lollipop costs $0.40, and there are five lollipops, we can infer that each candy must be cheaper than a lollipop because more lollipops were purchased at the same total price.

Let's assume the cost of one candy is \( C \). We have already calculated the cost of five lollipops as $3.20. Now, we need to find the cost of one candy.

Since the total cost of five lollipops is $3.20, the remaining amount after buying the five lollipops would be spent on candies.

First, calculate the total cost for the five lollipops:

\[
\$3.20 - (\text{total cost for five lollipops}) = \text{cost for five lollipops}
\]

Subtracting the cost of five lollipops from the total cost gives us the cost for one candy:

\[
C = \frac{\$3.20}{5}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
C = \$0.64
\]

So, each candy costs $0.64.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for ten candies.
Finally, we need to find the total cost for ten candies.

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 candies} = 10 \times \$0.64
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total cost for 10 candies} = \$6.40
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total cost for ten lollipops and ten candies is $\boxed{6.40}$.<|im_end|>","Five lollipops cost $0.4 x 5 = $<<0.4*5=2>>2.
So four candies cost $3.20 - $2 = $1.20.
Thus, each candy costs $1.20/4 = $<<1.20/4=0.30>>0.30.
Ten lollipops cost $0.4 x 10 = $<<0.4*10=4>>4.
Ten candies cost $0.30 x 10 = $<<0.30*10=3>>3.
Hence, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3 = $7.

                    Rong has been saving . 20 coins in his piggy bank every . month. Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong. How ? many coins are they having ten years after , they started their savings?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many coins Rong saves per month.
2. Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month based on Rong's amount.
3. Find out how many months there are in ten years.
4. Compute the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine how many coins Rong saves per month:**
   - Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Calculate how many coins Neil saves per month:**
   - Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong.
   - \( \text{Neil's coins per month} = 20 + (20 \times \frac{2}{5}) \)
     \[
     = 20 + (20 \times 0.4)
     \]
     \[
     = 20 + 8
     \]
     \[
     = 28 \text{ coins per month}
     \]

3. **Find out how many months there are in ten years:**
   - There are 12 months in one year.
   - Therefore, for ten years, there are \(10 \times 12 = 120\) months.

4. **Compute the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil over ten years:**

   - **Rong's total coins:**
     \[
     \text{Total coins from Rong} = 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
     \]

   - **Neil's total coins:**
     \[
     \text{Total coins from Neil} = 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
     \]

   - **Combined total coins:**
     \[
     \text{Total coins saved} = 2400 \text{ coins} + 3360 \text{ coins} = 5760 \text{ coins}
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5760}
\]<|im_end|>","Neil has been saving 2/5 times more coins in his piggy bank per month than Rong, a total of 2/5*20 = <<2/5*20=8>>8 more coins.
The total number of coins that Neil has been saving in his piggy month per month is 20+8 = <<20+8=28>>28 coins.
If Rong has been saving 20 coins every month for ten years, the total number of months he's been saving for is 12*10 = <<12*10=120>>120 months.
Saving 20 coins every month for ten years, Rong has 20*120 = <<20*120=2400>>2400 coins in his piggy bank.
If Neil has also been saving for ten years, he has saved 120*28 = <<120*28=3360>>3360 coins in his piggy bank.
The total number of coins they both have in their piggy banks after ten years of saving is 3360+2400 = <<3360+2400=5760>>5760

                    question:
                    John brings his dog to the : vet. His dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each, and a heartworm check. The heartworm check is 60% of his ; total bill. If he brought $125 with him, how much does he leave ! with?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines.
- Each vaccine costs $20.
- John needs 2 vaccines.

\[ \text{Total cost for vaccines} = 2 \times \$20 \]

\[ \text{Total cost for vaccines} = \$40 \]

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the heartworm check.
- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.

Let \( C \) be the total bill. We know that the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill.

\[ \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6 \times C \]

### Step 3: Find the total bill before the heartworm check.
- Let \( T \) be the total bill (before the heartworm check).

\[ T = \text{Total cost for vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check} \]

Substitute the values we have calculated so far:

\[ T = \$40 + 0.6C \]

### Step 4: Set up an equation to find the total bill \( C \).
- We also know that John started with $125.

\[ 125 = T \]

From Step 3, substitute \( T \):

\[ 125 = (\$40 + 0.6C) \]

Simplify and solve for \( C \):

\[ 125 - \$40 = 0.6C \]
\[ \$85 = 0.6C \]

Divide both sides by 0.6:

\[ C = \frac{\$85}{0.6} \]
\[ C = \$141.67 \]

So, the total bill (including the heartworm check) is $141.67.

### Step 5: Calculate the amount left after paying for the services.
- Subtract the total bill from what John started with:

\[ \text{Amount left} = \$125 - \$141.67 \]

Since $125 is less than $141.67, John cannot afford all the services he wants.

Therefore, John leaves with no money or a negative balance if he tries to pay for everything at once.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{The final answer is: John leaves with a negative balance.}

<|im_start|>system
To determine the total price of a crate containing 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of bananas.
- Each banana costs $0.5.
- There are 5 bananas.

\[ \text{Cost of bananas} = 5 \times \$0.5 = \$2.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of apples.
- Each apple costs $0.5.
- There are 12 apples.

\[ \text{Cost of apples} = 12 \times \$0.5 = \$6.0 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of oranges.
- Each orange costs \( 3 \times \$0.5 = \$1.5 \) (since oranges are the most expensive).

There are 7 oranges.

\[ \text{Cost of oranges} = 7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all the costs to find the total price.
- Total cost of bananas: $2.5
- Total cost of apples: $6.0
- Total cost of oranges: $10.5

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$2.5 + \$6.0 + \$10.5 = \$19.0 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: **$19.0**.<|im_end|>","The price for apples in the crate would be 12 * 0.5 = $<<12*0.5=6>>6.
Cost of banana is 0.5 * 2 = $<<0.5*2=1>>1.
So the bananas in this crate cost 5 * 1 = $<<5*1=5>>5.
One orange is three times more expensive than a banana, so it costs 1 * 3 = $<<1*3=3>>3.
So for the oranges in the crate, one needs to pay 7 * 3 = $<<7*3=21>>21.
So the whole crate costs 6 + 5 + 21 = $<<6+5+21=32>>32.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the number of each color square first and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of red squares:**
   - There are \(14\) red squares.

2. **Determine the number of blue squares:**
   - The number of blue squares is \(4\) more than the number of red squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue squares} = 14 + 4 = 18
     \]

3. **Determine the number of green squares:**
   - The number of green squares is \(6\) more than the number of blue squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of green squares} = 18 + 6 = 24
     \]

4. **Determine the number of white squares:**
   - The number of white squares is \(12\) less than the number of green squares.
     \[
     \text{Number of white squares} = 24 - 12 = 12
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of squares:**
   - Add all the colors together.
     \[
     \text{Total number of squares} = 14 (\text{red}) + 18 (\text{blue}) + 24 (\text{green}) + 12 (\text{white})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 70
     \]

6. **Convert the total number of squares into square feet:**
   - Each square measures \(1 \times 1\) foot.
   - Therefore, the total area in square feet is equal to the total number of squares.
     \[
     \text{Area (in square feet)} = 70 \times 1 = 70 \text{ square feet}
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 70 \text{ square feet}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many additional chairs Mia needs for tomorrow's event, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of high chairs:**
   - We know that there are 8 high chairs.

2. **Determine the number of regular chairs:**
   - According to the information provided, the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
     \[
     \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times \text{Number of high chairs}
     \]
     Substituting the given value:
     \[
     \text{Number of regular chairs} = 5 \times 8 = 40
     \]

3. **Sum up all the chairs needed:**
   - There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the event.
   - Add the number of high chairs and regular chairs together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of chairs needed} = \text{High chairs} + \text{Regular chairs}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of chairs needed} = 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of chairs needed} = 48
     \]

4. **Determine how many additional chairs are required:**
   - Subtract the current total number of chairs from the total number needed:
     \[
     \text{Additional chairs needed} = \text{Total number of chairs needed} - \text{Current number of chairs}
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Additional chairs needed} = 48 - (8 + 40)
     \]
     \[
     \text{Additional chairs needed} = 48 - 48 = 0
     \]

Therefore, Mia does not need to get any additional chairs because the restaurant already has enough chairs for both adults and babies. The final answer is: {The final answer is} 0.<|im_end|>","Since there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is 5 * 8 = <<8*5=40>>40 regular chairs

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each student has collected and then calculate the total points collected by the class. We'll use the information provided to find out how many points each student has and check if they meet or exceed the trip requirement.

1. **Adam's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   
2. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - \( \text{Betty's points} = \text{Adam's points} + (0.30 \times \text{Adam's points}) \)
   - \( \text{Betty's points} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) \)
   - \( \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65 \)

3. **Tom's Points:**
   - Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - \( \text{Tom's points} = \text{Betty's points} - 30 \)
   - \( \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35 \)

4. **Marta's Points:**
   - Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - \( \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times \text{Tom's points} \)
   - \( \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 \)
   - \( \text{Marta's points} = 105 \)

Now that we have the points collected by each student, let's sum them up to see if they reach or exceed the trip threshold:

- Total points collected: 
\[ 50 (\text{Adam}) + 65 (\text{Betty}) + 35 (\text{Tom}) + 105 (\text{Marta}) \]
\[ 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 \]

Since the class does not reach the minimum threshold of 400 points, it cannot go on the trip. Therefore, the class needs to collect more points to meet the trip requirements. 

**Final Answer:** The class needs to collect **more than 255 points** to ensure they can go on the trip. Since the current total is only 255 points, the class still falls short of meeting the trip requirement.<|im_end|>","Betty has 30% more points than Adam, so it's 30/100 * 50 = <<30/100*50=15>>15 points more.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = <<65-30=35>>35 points.
Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 * 35 = <<3*35=105>>105 points.
In total, all students collected 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = <<50+65+35+105=255>>255 points.

To determine the number of great-grandbabies that Great Grandma Jones will have at the reunion, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of grandchildren:**
   - Each of Great Grandma's three children has three children.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren = \(3 \text{ (children)} \times 3 \text{ (grandchildren per child)}\).

2. **Calculate the total number of great-grandbabies:**
   - Each of these grandchildren has three babies.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account.
2. Calculate the amount she spends on her car payment.
3. Subtract both amounts from her total pay to find out how much she has left.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Greta puts into her retirement account.
- Her total pay is $2400.00.
- She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account.
- To calculate 50%, multiply $2400.00 by 0.5 (since 50% = 0.5).

\[
$2400.00 \times 0.5 = $1200.00
\]

So, Greta puts $1200.00 into her retirement account.

Step 2: Calculate the amount she spends on her car payment.
- Her total pay is $2400.00.
- She spends 20% of her pay on her car payment.

So, Greta spends $480.00 on her car payment.

Step 3: Subtract both amounts from her total pay to find out how much she has left.
- First subtract the amount put into her retirement account ($1200.00).
- Then subtract the amount spent on her car payment ($480.00).

\[
$2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00

                    question:
                    Hannah's city is having a big display of fireworks for the 4th of July. They're going to set off 15 boxes . of 20 fireworks each.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many fireworks Hannah sees from both her home and her backyard. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fireworks in the city display.
- There are 15 boxes of fireworks in the city display.
- Each box contains 20 fireworks.

\[ \text{Total fireworks in the city} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her home.
- Hannah’s house is positioned such that she can only see 40% of the city's fireworks.

\[ \text{Fireworks visible from home} = 300 \times 0.4 = 120 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of fireworks in Hannah's backyard setup.
- Hannah sets up 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard.
- Each box contains 5 fireworks.

\[ \text{Total fireworks in backyard} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

### Step 4: Determine how many of these fireworks Hannah can see from her backyard.
- Since Hannah’s backyard setup does not affect what she can see from her home (as per the information provided), all 15 fireworks in her backyard will be seen from her home.

### Step 5: Combine the totals.
- From her home, Hannah sees 120 fireworks.
- From her backyard, Hannah also sees 15 fireworks.

\[ \text{Total fireworks seen} = 120 + 15 = 135 \]

Therefore, Hannah will see a total of **135 fireworks**. The final answer is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of people**

Aiden + 12 friends + 7 more friends = **20 people**

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of seats needed**

Since each person needs space for one drink and three snacks, we calculate the total number of seats required as follows:
\[ \text{Total seats} = 20 \times (1 + 3) = 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of drinks and snacks per seat**

Each seat can hold:
- One person
- Two drinks
- Three snacks

So, for each seat, they need:
- \(1\) drink
- \(2\) drinks (total: \(1 + 2 = 3\)) = **\(1\) drink**
- \(3\) snacks

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed**

For 80 seats, they will need:
- Drinks: \(80 \times 1 = 80\) drinks
- Snacks: \(80 \times 3 = 240\) snacks

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks**

Drinks cost $2 each, so:
\[ \text{Cost of drinks} = 80 \times 2 = \$160 \]

Snacks also cost $2 each, so:
\[ \text{Cost of snacks} = 240 \times 2 = \$480 \]

**Step 6: Sum the costs to find the total expenditure**

Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$160 + \$480 = \$640 \]

Therefore, the group has spent a total of $\boxed{640}$ dollars on snacks and drinks.<|im_end|>","Including Aiden, the whole group saves 1 + 12 + 7 = <<1+12+7=20>>20 seats.

In total, the seats can hold 3 snacks * 20 seats = <<3*20=60>>60 snacks.
So in total, the group buys 40 drinks + 60 snacks = <<40+60=100>>100 items.
As snacks and drinks cost $2 each, the group has spent 100 items * $2 = $<<100*2=200>>200 overall.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Gary's truck can carry based on the information provided about Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the capacity of Gissela's truck:**
   - Gissela’s truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
   
2. **Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck:**
   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds.
   - Calculation: \( 4000 \text{ pounds} + 800 \text{ pounds} = 4800 \text{ pounds} \).

3. **Calculate the total capacity if all three trucks were used together:**
   - The total capacity for all three trucks together should be 11,600 pounds.
   - Let's denote the capacity of Gary's truck as \( x \).
   - According to the given information, the sum of their capacities equals 11,600 pounds.
   - So, \( 4000 \text{ pounds (Gissela)} + 4800 \text{ pounds (Gordy)} + x \text{ pounds (Gary)} = 11600 \text{ pounds} \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine the known capacities: \( 4000 + 4800 + x = 11600 \).
   - Simplify: \( 8800 + x = 11600 \).
   - Subtract 8800 from both sides: \( x = 11600 - 8800 \).
   - Calculate: \( x = 2800 \).

### Conclusion:
Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2800} \]<|im_end|>","Gordy's truck can carry 4000+800=<<4000+800=4800>>4800 pounds of gravel.

<|im_start|>user

Let's break down this problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine how many dumplings each male ate.
- We know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male must have eaten \(3 + 1 = 4\) dumplings.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all males.
- There are 8 males.
- Each male ate 4 dumplings.
- Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by all males is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

### Step 3: Determine how many dumplings each female ate.
- The problem states that each female ate 3 dumplings.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by all females.
- There are 6 females.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- Therefore, the total number of dumplings eaten by all females is \(6 \times 3 = 18\).

### Step 5: Sum up the total number of dumplings eaten by both males and females.
- Total dumplings eaten by all males: 32
- Total dumplings eaten by all females: 18
- Total dumplings eaten by everyone: \(32 + 18 = 50\)

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 50 dumplings.<|im_end|>","So each male ate 3 + 1 = <<3+1=4>>4 dumplings.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the total number of parts in the ratio**
Gerald and Julia's ratio is 3:2. This means that for every 5 parts (3 + 2), they divide $100.

**Step 2: Calculate the value of one part of the ratio**
Since the total amount is $100, we can find the value of one part by dividing $100 by the sum of the ratio numbers.
\[ \text{Value per part} = \frac{\$100}{5} = \$20 \]

**Step 3: Find out how much Gerald has initially**
Gerald gets 3 parts from the total division. Therefore, his initial amount is:
\[ \text{Initial amount for Gerald} = 3 \times \$20 = \$60 \]

**Step 4: Subtract the amount spent on a book from Gerald's initial amount**
Gerald spends $10 on a book. So, we subtract this from his initial amount:
\[ \text{Amount after buying a book} = \$60 - \$10 = \$50 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Gerald has left is:
\[
\boxed{\$50}
\]<|im_end|>","The $100 was divided into 3 + 2 = <<3+2=5>>5 parts.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the speed of the turtle.
- We know that Martha's cat runs at 15 feet per second.
- The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.

Let \( v_t \) be the speed of the turtle (in feet per second).

Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle:
\[ v_c = 5 \times v_t \]

Given that \( v_c = 15 \) feet per second:
\[ 15 = 5 \times v_t \]
Solving for \( v_t \):
\[ v_t = \frac{15}{5} \]
\[ v_t = 3 \] feet per second

Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle crawls in 40 seconds.
- The turtle's speed is 3 feet per second.
- We want to find out how far the turtle travels in 40 seconds.

Distance \( d \) traveled by the turtle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ d = v_t \times t \]

Substituting the values:
\[ d = 3 \times 40 \]
\[ d = 120 \] feet

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more hours are required for the firefighters to meet their fundraising goal after the initial 3 hours.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the remaining amount needed:**
   - Total goal = $6300
   - Amount raised so far = $2100
   - Remaining amount needed = Total goal - Amount raised so far
     \[
     \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which they raise money per hour:**
   - They raised $2100 in 3 hours.
   - Rate (in dollars per hour) = Amount raised / Time taken
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of hours required to raise the remaining amount:**
   - Remaining amount needed = $4200
   - Rate (dollars per hour) = $700
   - Number of hours required = Remaining amount needed / Rate
     \[
     \text{Number of hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of the total water from the Colorado River that Colorado City uses for non-industrial purposes.

1. **Determine the amount of water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - Of this 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

2. **Calculate the proportion of water used for industrial purposes:**
   \[
   \text{Proportion used for industry} = 40\% \times 80\% = 32\%

4. **Determine the total percentage of water used by Colorado City:**
   - The entire 40% of the water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City.

5. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage for non-industrial purposes} = \left(\frac{\text{Non-Industrial portion}}{\text{Total portion}}\right) \times 100\%

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it takes for the ice cream factory to produce both chocolate and vanilla ice creams.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the production rate for each type of ice cream:**
   - For chocolate ice cream:
     \[
     \text{Production rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]
   
   - For vanilla ice cream:
     \[
     \text{Production rate} = \frac{\text{Total amount}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total production over 48 hours:**
   - Chocolate ice cream production in 48 hours:
     \[
     \text{Chocolate production} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts}
     \]
   
   - Vanilla ice cream production in 48 hours:
     \[
     \text{Vanilla production} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts}
     \]

3. **Sum the total production from both types of ice creams:**
   \[
   \text{Total production} = \text{Chocolate production} + \text{Vanilla production} = 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts}
   \]

### Conclusion:
In total, the ice cream factory would produce **3000 quarts** of ice cream in 48 hours.

{The final answer is} 3000 quarts<|im_end|>","Chocolate ice cream can be made at 100 quarts / 2 hours = <<100/2=50>>50 quarts per hour.
Vanilla ice cream can be made at 50 quarts / 4 hours = <<50/4=12.5>>12.5 quarts per hour.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 50 quarts = <<48*50=2400>>2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.
In 48 hours there would be 48 * 12.5 quarts = <<48*12.5=600>>600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.
Combined there would be 2400 chocolate + 600 vanilla = <<2400+600=3000>>3000 quarts of ice cream.

<|im_start|>system
To determine Marcus's total bill after applying the loyalty discount, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item type**

- **Croissants**: 
  - Number: 5
  - Price per piece: $3.00
  - Total for croissants = 5 * $3.00 = $15.00

- **Cinnamon Rolls**:
  - Number: 4
  - Price per roll: $2.50
  - Total for cinnamon rolls = 4 * $2.50 = $10.00

- **Mini Quiches**:
  - Number: 3
  - Price per quiche: $4.00
  - Total for mini quiches = 3 * $4.00 = $12.00

- **Blueberry Muffins**:
  - Number: 13
  - Price per muffin: $1.00
  - Total for blueberry muffins = 13 * $1.00 = $13.00

**Step 2: Sum up the individual totals**

- Croissants + Cinnamon Rolls + Mini Quiches + Blueberry Muffins
  - Total = $15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins)
  - Total = $50.00

**Step 3: Apply the loyalty discount**

- Loyalty discount rate: 10%
- Discount amount = $50.00 * 10% = $5.00

**Step 4: Subtract the discount from the total**

- Final bill = $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

**Final Answer**
Marcus's total bill after applying the loyalty discount is \boxed{45.00}.<|im_end|>","5 croissants cost $3.00 each so they cost 5*3 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger after two weeks, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.
Two weeks equals \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.

### Step 2: Determine the amount of candy eaten by Ginger over 14 days.
Ginger eats 4 pieces per day. Therefore, for 14 days, she will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

### Step 3: Determine the amount of candy eaten by Amy over 14 days.
Amy eats 3 pieces per day. Therefore, for 14 days, she will eat:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his bathroom area, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area to be covered:**
   - The total area of the bathroom is given as \(36\) square feet.
   - Mr. Boarden wants to cover only two-thirds of this area.

\[
\text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ square feet}
\]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 36 = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ square feet}
\]

So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover an area of \(24\) square feet.

3. **Determine the number of mosaic tiles needed per square foot:**
   - According to the instructions, for every square foot, he needs \(24\) mosaic tiles.

4. **Calculate the total number of mosaic tiles required:**
   - To find out how many tiles are needed for \(24\) square feet, multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot.

\[
\text{Total number of tiles} = 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles per square foot}
\]

5. **Perform the multiplication:**

\[
24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles}

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost James would incur if he bought blueberries from the store and compare it to the cost of picking them himself.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Cost Calculation Based on Picking Blueberries:

1. **Cost per pound**: The problem states that it costs $1.5 per pound.
2. **Pounds picked**: James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
3. **Total cost based on picking**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of pounds}) \times (\text{Cost per pound})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30 \times 1.5 = \$45
   \]

#### Cost Calculation Based on Buying Blueberries from Store:

1. **Price per pound at store**: The problem states that blueberries at the store cost $2.5 per pound.
2. **Pounds picked**: James picked 30 pounds of blueberries.
3. **Total cost based on store purchase**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of pounds}) \times (\text{Price per pound})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30 \times 2.5 = \$75
   \]

### Final Comparison:

Now, let's find out how much James saved by picking his own blueberries instead of buying them from the store.

1. **Store Purchase Total**: $75
2. **Picked Blueberries Total**: $45
3. **Savings**:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost at store} - \text{Total cost of picked blueberries}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 75 - 45 = \$30
   \]

Therefore, James saved $30 by picking his own blueberries instead of buying them from the store.

{The final answer is} The final answer is: \( \boxed{30} \)<|im_end|>","He paid 30*1.5=$<<30*1.5=45>>45 for the blueberries he picked

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original budget per computer
- The company originally planned to spend $700 on each computer.

### Step 2: Calculate the new price per computer after the increase
- The price increased by 10%, so we need to calculate 10% of $700.
\[ \text{Increase} = 700 \times \frac{10}{100} = 700 \times 0.10 = 70 \]

- Adding this increase to the original price gives us the new price.
\[ \text{New Price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying 500 computers at the new price
- Now that we know the new price per computer is $770, we can find out how much all 500 computers would cost together.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 770 \times 500 \]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication
\[ 770 \times 500 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is **$385,000**.<|im_end|>","When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs used in the omelet.
John uses 6 eggs for his omelet.

- Calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
\[ \text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 \]
\[ \text{Calories from eggs} = 450 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories contributed by the cheese.
John uses 2 ounces of cheese.

- Calories from cheese = Amount of cheese × Calories per ounce
\[ \text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Calories from cheese} = 240 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories contributed by the ham.
John uses an equal amount of ham as he does of cheese (since the problem states ""an equal amount"").

- Calories from ham = Amount of ham × Calories per ounce
\[ \text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Calories from ham} = 80 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all the calories to find the total calorie content of the omelet.
Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
\[ \text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total calories} = 870 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{870}
\]<|im_end|>","The eggs contributed 6*75=<<6*75=450>>450 calories

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 6 pencils and 8 erasers, then subtract that amount from the $10 you paid. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 6 pencils.
Each pencil costs $0.50, so for 6 pencils:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3 \]
So, the total cost for 6 pencils is $3.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 erasers.
Each eraser costs $0.25, so for 8 erasers:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \]
So, the total cost for 8 erasers is $2.

### Step 3: Add the costs together.
Now, let's add the cost of the pencils and the cost of the erasers:
\[ 3 + 2 = 5 \]

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from what was paid.
You paid $10, so after paying for the pencils and erasers, you will receive change:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, the amount of change you would get is $\boxed{5}$.<|im_end|>","6 pencils cost 6 x $0.50 = $<<6*0.5=3>>3.

Number of people receiving a job offer = \( \frac{20}{100} \times 30 \)

\[ \text{Number of people receiving a job offer} = 6 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people accepting the position**

Given:
- Number of people receiving a job offer = 6
- Fraction of people accepting the position = \( \frac{1}{3} \) (since it's stated as a fraction)

Number of people accepting the position = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \)

\[ \text{Number of people accepting the position} = 2 \]

Therefore, **the final answer is**: 2 people accept the position.<|im_end|>","The number of people that receive interviews is 100 * 0.30 = <<100*0.30=30>>30 people

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes when her arms are raised for 2 out of the 5 minutes, and then when they are lowered for the remaining 3 minutes.

1. **Calculate taps when her arms are raised:**
   - Her tap rate with arms raised is 200 taps per minute.
   - She raises her arms for 2 minutes.
   - Total taps = Rate × Time = 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps.

2. **Calculate taps when her arms are lowered:**
   - Her tap rate with arms lowered is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute (since she can tap both her feet).
   - She lowers her arms for 3 minutes.
   - Total taps = Rate × Time = 550 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

3. **Combine the two results:**
   - Total taps when arms raised: 400 taps.
   - Total taps when arms lowered: 1650 taps.
   - Combined total taps = 400 taps + 1650 taps = 2050 taps.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate both the costs associated with not fixing the pothole and the costs of repairing it.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Cost of Damage to the Car
If the pothole remains unfixed, it will cause $450 worth of damage to Ron's car. This is a one-time expense.

#### Cost of Repairing the Pothole
Ron has two options: either fix the pothole himself or hire someone else to do it. Let's consider both scenarios.

**Option 1 - Fixing the Pothole Himself**
- The cost of buying 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each.
\[ \text{Cost} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75 \]

**Option 2 - Hiring Someone Else to Fix the Pothole**
Let's assume the total cost of hiring someone else to fix the pothole is represented as \( X \).

Since there is no specific information about the cost of hiring someone else, let's focus on the self-repair option first because it might be cheaper than hiring help.

#### Total Cost of Fixing the Pothole (Self-Repairs)
Assuming the self-repair cost is just the cost of the asphalt buckets, this would be $75.

#### Cost of Fines
If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will face a fine of $120.

#### Net Savings Calculation
First, let’s calculate the net savings from fixing the pothole without considering fines initially:

Total initial cost of damaging the car ($450) + Cost of repairing the pothole ($75) = Total repair cost
$450 + $75 = $525

Next, add the fine:
$525 + $120 = $645

Now, subtract the repair cost from the total initial cost to find out how much Ron saves:
$645 - $525 = $120

So, Ron saves **$120** by fixing the pothole himself instead of paying the fine.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } \$120}
\]<|im_end|>","First find the total cost of the asphalt by multiplying the number of buckets by the cost per bucket: 3 buckets * $25/bucket = $<<3*25=75>>75

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many chairs the restaurant has left after some were repaired, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of normal chairs**: 
   - There are 170 normal chairs.

2. **Calculate the remaining normal chairs**:
   - Since 20 normal chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair.
   - Remaining normal chairs = Total normal chairs - Sent chairs
     \[
     \text{Remaining normal chairs} = 170 - 20 = 150
     \]

3. **Identify the total number of baby chairs**:
   - There are 23 baby chairs.

4. **Calculate the remaining baby chairs**:
   - Since 13 baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair.
   - Remaining baby chairs = Total baby chairs - Sent chairs
     \[
     \text{Remaining baby chairs} = 23 - 13 = 10
     \]

5. **Sum up the remaining chairs**:
   - Add the remaining normal chairs to the remaining baby chairs.
     \[
     \text{Total remaining chairs} = \text{Remaining normal chairs} + \text{Remaining baby chairs}
       = 150 + 10 = 160

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much pizza was eaten and then subtract that from the total number of slices available.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   - Each person ordered one pizza.
   - There are five people in total (Bryce + 4 friends).
   - Each pizza has 12 slices.
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how much each group ate:**

   - **Bryce and two friends together:** They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas.
     - Since there are three people in this group, they ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 12 slices per person.
     \[
     \text{Slices eaten by this group} = 3 \times \left(\frac{2}{3} \times 12\right)
     \]
     Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \text{Slices eaten by this group} = 3 \times \left(8\right) = 24 \text{ slices}
     \]

   - **Two remaining friends together:** They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas.
     - Since there are two people in this group, they ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 12 slices per person.
     \[
     \text{Slices eaten by this group} = 2 \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times 12\right)
     \]
     Simplify inside the parentheses first:
     \[
     \text{Slices eaten by this group} = 2 \times \left(9\right) = 18 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Sum the slices eaten by both groups:**
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = 24 \text{ slices (Bryce's group)} + 18 \text{ slices (remaining friends)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Subtract the total slices eaten from the total number of slices available:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining slices} = 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18.

{The final answer is} 18 slices.<|im_end|>","Bryce and his 4 friends each ordered a pizza with 12 slices, so there were 5 pizzas x 12 slices per pizza = <<5*12=60>>60 slices of pizza.
2/3 of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 8/12 because 2/3 x 4/4 = 8/12.
Bryce and two of his friends each ate 2/3 or 8 slices of pizza, so 3 friends x 8 slices of pizza = 24 slices of pizza.
¾ of a pizza with 12 slices would be the same as 9/12 because ¾ x 3/3 = 9/12.
Bryce’s two remaining friends each ate ¾ or 9 slices of pizza, so 2 friends x 9 slices = <<2*9=18>>18 slices of pizza.
Together, Bryce and his friends ate 24 + 18 = <<24+18=42>>42 slices of pizza.
Of the 60 total slices of pizza, the friends ate 42, and 60 slices – 42 slices = <<60-42=18>>18 slices of pizza were left.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the time taken by the dog to eat the sausages:**
   - The cat takes 30 minutes to eat 9 sausages.
   - Therefore, the dog eats the same number of sausages in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of that time.

   Let's calculate the time for the dog:
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Dog's time} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time both animals spend eating the sausages together:**
   - Cat: 30 minutes
   - Dog: 20 minutes

   Total time:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 30 \text{ minutes (cat)} + 20 \text{ minutes (dog)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average time spent eating the sausages:**
   - Average time is the total time divided by the number of individuals (which is 2).

   Average time:
   \[
   \text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average time} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the average time the two animals take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.<|im_end|>","If the cat takes 30 minutes to eat the sausages, the dog takes 2/3*30 = <<30*2/3=20>>20 minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches.
2. Set up an equation based on the relationship between Topher's and Bobby's shoe lengths.
3. Solve for Bobby's shoe length.

Let's start converting Topher's shoe length to inches.

**Step 1: Convert Topher's shoe length**

Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.

- There are 12 inches in a foot.
- So, 8 feet = \(8 \times 12\) inches.
- Adding the additional 4 inches gives us Topher's total length in inches.

\[
\text{Total Length (in inches)} = 8 \times 12 + 4
\]

Now let's calculate that:

\[
8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches}
\]

So, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

**Step 2: Set up the equation**

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

Let \( x \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

Then,

\[ 
x = 9y + 10 
\]

where \( y \) is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

**Step 3: Solve for Bobby's shoe length**

Given that Topher's shoe length is 100 inches, we can substitute this value into our equation:

\[
100 = 9y + 10
\]

Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the term involving \( y \):

\[
90 = 9y
\]

Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \text{ inches}
\]

Therefore, one of Bobby's shoes is **10 inches** long.<|im_end|>","Since Topher’s shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long, then it is (8 * 12) + 4 = <<8*12+4=100>>100 inches long.
If we let the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, in inches, be x.
Then the length of Topher’s shoe is represented by the equation, 9*x + 10 = 100.
Subtracting 10 from each side of the equation, the expression simplifies to 9x = 90
Solving for x, the length of one of Bobby’s shoes is x = <<10=10>>10

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of car windows.
2. Determine how many windows Hannah smashes based on her actions.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of car windows**

- Number of student cars = 64
- Each student car has 4 windows

\[ \text{Total number of student car windows} = 64 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Total number of student car windows} = 256 \]

- Number of teacher cars = 32
- Each teacher car has 2 windows

\[ \text{Total number of teacher car windows} = 32 \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Total number of teacher car windows} = 64 \]

**Step 2: Sum the total number of windows**

\[ \text{Total number of windows} = (256 + 64) \]

\[ \text{Total number of windows} = 320 \]

**Step 3: Determine how many windows Hannah smashes**

- Hannah smashes \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the student car windows.

\[ \text{Windows smashed by Hannah} = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 256 \]

\[ \text{Windows smashed by Hannah} = 64 \]

- Hannah also smashes \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the teacher car windows.

\[ \text{Windows smashed by Hannah} = \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) \times 64 \]

\[ \text{Windows smashed by Hannah} = 48 \]

**Step 4: Add the number of windows smashed by Hannah**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of spools:**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
   
   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150
   \]

2. **Determine the percentage of blue spools:**
   - Number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60
   
   Percentage of blue spools = 
   \[
   \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people have voted by different times and then find out how many people have not yet voted.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Initial Condition:
At 8:00 AM, there were **5000** people lining up to vote.

#### Midday (12:00 PM):
By midday, **2/5** of the people had voted.
\[ \text{Number of voters} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

Remaining people after midday:
\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

#### 16:00 (4:00 PM):
By 16:00, **2/3** of the remaining people had voted.
\[ \text{Number of voters} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

Remaining people after 16:00:
\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is **1000**.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many packs of gum Parker needs for 30 days, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker consumes in 30 days.
Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day. Therefore, over 30 days, he will consume:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many packs of gum this amount represents.
Each pack contains 15 pieces of gum. To find out how many packs are needed for 120 pieces, divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need **8 packs** of gum to last him 30 days.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of Smores needed.

First, we calculate the total number of Smores that all the children and adults want to consume.

- **Children:** There are 9 kids, and each kid wants 2 Smores.
  \[
  9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ Smores per kid} = 18 \text{ Smores}
  \]

- **Adults:** There are 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 Smore.
  \[
  6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ Smore per adult} = 6 \text{ Smores}
  \]

Now, add these together to get the total number of Smores needed.
\[
18 \text{ Smores (children)} + 6 \text{ Smores (adults)} = 24 \text{ Smores}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many Smores one box of Graham Crackers can make.

Each sleeve of Graham Crackers makes enough Smores for 8 large Smores.

Therefore, one box contains \(3\) sleeves, so:
\[
\frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{1 \text{ box}} \times 8 \text{ Smores per sleeve} = 24 \text{ Smores per box}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many boxes of Graham Crackers are needed.

Now, divide the total number of Smores needed by the number of Smores one box can provide:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ Smores needed}}{24 \text{ Smores per box}} = 1 \text{ box}
\]

Thus, they need exactly **1** box of Graham Crackers to satisfy everyone’s desire for Smores.<|im_end|>","Each sleeve makes 8 smores and there are 3 sleeves in a box so a box can make 8*3 = <<8*3=24>>24 smores

There are 6 adults who will eat 1 smore a piece so they will eat 6*1 = <<6*1=6>>6 smores
Together the kids will eat 18 and the adults will eat 6 so 18+6 = <<18+6=24>>24 smores

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Dora's father's age.
Given that Dora's age is 15 years, we can use the information that Dora's father's age is ""eight more than twice Dora's age.""

Let \( F \) represent Dora's father's age.

According to the given relationship:
\[ F = 2D + 8 \]

Substitute \( D = 15 \):
\[ F = 2(15) + 8 \]
\[ F = 30 + 8 \]
\[ F = 38 \]

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

### Step 2: Determine Dora's mother's age.
We know that Dora's mother is ""four years younger"" than Dora's father.

Let \( M \) represent Dora's mother's age.

According to the given relationship:
\[ M = F - 4 \]

Substitute \( F = 38 \):
\[ M = 38 - 4 \]
\[ M = 34 \]

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

### Step 3: Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Now, let's add their ages together:
\[ Total\ Age = D + F + M \]
\[ Total\ Age = 15 + 38 + 34 \]
\[ Total\ Age = 87 \]

### Conclusion:
The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is **87** years.<|im_end|>","If Dora's age is 15, her father, with eight more than twice Dora's age, is eight more than 15*2 = <<15*2=30>>30 years.

Together, Dora and her father have a total age of 38+15 =<<38+15=53>>53.
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father, meaning Dora's mother is 38-4 = 34 years old.
Altogether, Dora's family has a total age of 53+34 = <<53+34=87>>87 years.

To find the total weight of Cindy's books when she carries them all at once, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the weight of Cindy's science books:**
   - Each science book weighs 2 pounds.
   - There are two science books (one for math and one for science).
   - Therefore, the total weight of the science books = \(2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}\).

2. **Calculate the weight of the French book:**
   - The French book weighs 4 pounds.

3. **Calculate the weight of the English book:**
   - The English book weighs 3 pounds.

4. **Calculate the weight of the history book:**
   - The history book weighs twice as much as the English book.
   - Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs \(2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}\).

5. **Sum up the weights of all the books:**
   - Math book: 2 pounds

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many votes each candidate received based on the information provided.

Step 1: Calculate the number of votes for Candidate B.
Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A.

- Since Candidate A got 20%, we calculate 20% of 100 (the total number of votes):
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 20 \]

- Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A:
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate B} = 20 + (50\% \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Step 2: Determine the number of votes for Candidate C.
Since all votes must sum up to 100, we subtract the votes for Candidates A and B from the total:

- Votes for Candidate C:
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for Candidate A} + \text{Votes for Candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Votes for Candidate C} = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of votes that Candidate C received is \( \boxed{50} \).<|im_end|>","Candidate A got 100 x 20/100 = <<100*20/100=20>>20 votes.

Thus, candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.
Candidate A and B have 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes together.
Therefore, candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50 votes.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many apples Beck originally has**
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.

Therefore, Beck originally has:
\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

**Step 2: Calculate how many apples Boris will give to Beck**
- Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

After giving these apples, Boris will have:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]

**Step 3: Determine how many apples Beck will have after receiving the apples from Boris**
- After receiving 10 apples from Boris, Beck will have:
\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

**Step 4: Find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now**
- Boris now has 90 apples.
- Beck has 87 apples.

So, Beck has \( 90 - 87 = 3 \) fewer apples than Boris.

                    Peter wants to make different sized ice cubes with 32 ounces ? of water. He can make . giant cubes ? that use 4 ounces , per cube, medium cubes that use 2 ounces, and small cubes that use 1/2 an ounce.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for making all the ice cubes and then subtract it from the initial amount of water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used for giant cubes.
- Giant cubes use \(4\) ounces each.
- Number of giant cubes made = \(3\).

\[ \text{Total water for giant cubes} = 3 \times 4 \]

Let's compute this:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Peter uses \(12\) ounces of water for the giant cubes.

#### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used for medium cubes.
- Medium cubes use \(2\) ounces each.
- Number of medium cubes made = \(7\).

\[ \text{Total water for medium cubes} = 7 \times 2 \]

Let's compute this:

\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

So, Peter uses \(14\) ounces of water for the medium cubes.

#### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water used for small cubes.
- Small cubes use \(0.5\) ounces each (which is equivalent to \(1\) ounce).
- Number of small cubes made = \(8\).

\[ \text{Total water for small cubes} = 8 \times 1 \]

Let's compute this:

\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

So, Peter uses \(8\) ounces of water for the small cubes.

#### Step 4: Sum up the total amount of water used.
\[ \text{Total water used} = \text{water for giant cubes} + \text{water for medium cubes} + \text{water for small cubes} \]

Substituting the values calculated above:

\[ \text{Total water used} = 12 + 14 + 8 \]

Let's compute this sum:

\[ 12 + 14 + 8 = 34 \]

So, Peter has used a total of \(34\) ounces of water.

#### Step 5: Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water.
- Initial amount of water = \(32\) ounces.

\[ \text{Remaining water} = \text{initial water} - \text{total water used} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 32 - 34 \]

Since \(32\) is greater than \(34\), Peter will not be able to make any more ice cubes because there isn't enough water left.

Therefore, Peter will run out of water before he can make any additional ice cubes.

### Conclusion:
Peter has used a total of \(34\) ounces of water and therefore cannot continue making ice cubes as he only had \(32\) ounces initially. The remaining amount of water is zero because he ran out of water before completing his intended number of cubes.

However, if you meant to ask about the leftover water after making some ice cubes, let's assume he finished making them. Then the calculation would be:

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 32 - (12 + 14 + 8) \]
\[ \text{Remaining water} = 32 - 34 \]
\[ \text{Remaining water} = -2 \]

This result indicates that Peter actually exceeded the available water by \(2\) ounces, meaning he runs out of water before finishing his planned ice cubes. Therefore, the correct interpretation should consider the fact that he started with \(32\) ounces but used \(34\) ounces in total. 

Given the context of the problem, the final answer considering the practical constraint is:

**The final answer is:** {The final answer is} Peter has no water left after making the ice cubes.<|im_end|>","The giant cubes used up 12 ounces of water because 3 times 4 equals <<3*4=12>>12.
The medium cubes used up 14 ounces of water because 7 times 2 equals <<7*2=14>>14.
The small cubes used up 4 ounces of water because 8 times 1/2 equals 4.
This means that Peter has used up 30 ounces of water because 12 plus 14 plus 4 equals 30.
Peter has 2 ounces of water left because 32 minus 30 equals <<32-30=2>>2.

                    question:
                    Alice has 6 more books than Steven. Clara has two times as many books as Steven. If Clara has 20 books, how many more books does Clara : have than Alice?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more books Clara has compared to Alice, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books Steven has:**
   - We know that Clara has twice as many books as Steven.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
   - According to the information given, Clara has 20 books.

   Therefore,
   \[
   2S = 20
   \]

   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   So, Steven has 10 books.

2. **Calculate the number of books Alice has:**
   - Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
   - Since Steven has 10 books, Alice's number of books can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     A = S + 6
     \]
     Substituting \( S = 10 \):
     \[
     A = 10 + 6 = 16
     \]
   So, Alice has 16 books.

3. **Compare the number of books Clara and Alice have:**
   - Clara has 20 books.
   - Alice has 16 books.

4. **Find out how many more books Clara has than Alice:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = C - A
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of a half-gallon jar:**
   - We know that a gallon jar costs $5.
   - A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.

Let \( C \) represent the cost of one half-gallon jar.

From the information given:
\[ 5 = C + 2 \]

Solving for \( C \):
\[ C = 5 - 2 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, the cost of one half-gallon jar is $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars:**
   - Each gallon jar costs $5.
   - There are 10 gallons in total.

Therefore, the total cost for 10 gallons is:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars:**
   - Each half-gallon jar costs $3.
   - There are 16 half-gallons in total.

Therefore, the total cost for 16 half-gallons is:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Add the costs together:**

Summing up both totals gives us the overall expenditure:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars} \]

                    A class . of 50 students has various hobbies. 10 like to bake, 5 like to play basketball, and the rest : like to either play video games or play music. How many like to play video games if the . number that like ? to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of students who do not like any hobby.

Given:
- Total number of students = 50
- Number of students who like baking = 10
- Number of students who like playing basketball = 5

Number of students who don't like any hobby = Total number of students - (Number of students who like baking + Number of students who like playing basketball)
= 50 - (10 + 5) 
= 50 - 15 
= 35

So, 35 students do not like any hobby.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of students who like either playing video games or playing music.

Since we know that the remaining students like either playing video games or playing music, the sum of these two groups must equal the number of students who do not like any hobby.

Let \( x \) be the number of students who like playing music. According to the problem, the number of students who like playing music is twice the number of students who like playing basketball.

So,
\[ x = 2 \times 5 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 students who like playing music.

### Step 3: Find the number of students who like playing video games.

Now, subtract the number of students who like playing music from the total number of students who do not like any hobby.

Total number of students who do not like any hobby = 35
Number of students who like playing music = 10

Number of students who like playing video games = Total number of students who do not like any hobby - Number of students who like playing music
= 35 - 10
= 25

### Conclusion:
The number of students who like playing video games is **25**.<|im_end|>","The number of students that like to play music is twice as many as the number who like basketball, so 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10

Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial count**: Jeremy initially sees 12 birds in their backyard.
   
   \[
   \text{Initial number of birds} = 12
   \]

2. **Birds scared away**:
   - Jeremy throws a stone and scares away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the birds.
   - To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \).

   \[
   \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]

3. **Remaining birds after being scared away**:
   - Subtract the number of birds scared away from the initial number.

   \[
   \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Additional birds joining**:
   - After being scared away, some birds join back, but we're not given the exact number. However, it's stated that 20 more birds joined the fearless birds.

5. **Final count**:
   - Add the additional 20 birds to the remaining 8 birds.

   \[
   \text{Final number of birds} = 8 + 20 = 28
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 28 birds are now in the backyard.<|im_end|>","The total number of birds scared away after he threw the stone at them is 1/3 * 12 = <<1/3*12=4>>4 birds.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of students per class:**
   - There are two classes in total.
   - The total number of students is 80.

   To find out how many students are in each class, we divide the total number of students by the number of classes:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per class} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls in one class:**
   - We know that 40% of the students in each class are girls.
   
   First, calculate 40% of the students in one class:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls per class} = \text{Number of students per class} \times 0.40 = 40 \times 0.40 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boys in one class:**
   - Since there are 40 students in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys per class} = \text{Number of students per class} - \text{Number of girls per class} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(24\).

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{24}\).<|im_end|>","If both classes have the same amount of students, that means each of them has 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 students.

To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of grooming tasks for all types of animals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of grooming tasks:**
   - Dogs needing baths: 8
   - Cats needing nail clippings: 5
   - Birds needing wing trims: 3
   - Horses needing brushing: 12

   Total = 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses)

<|im_start|>system
To determine Mark's profit from selling his Magic Card Packs, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Spending
Mark spends on three packs at $1800 each.

\[
\text{Total spending} = 3 \times \$1800 = \$5400
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Revenue from Selling Cards
Mark sells two special cards and 30 regular cards.

- The value of one special card (worth $4000) is sold.
  
  \[
  \text{Revenue from one special card} = \$4000
  \]

- The value of one regular card (worth $50) is sold.

  \[
  \text{Revenue from one regular card} = \$50 \times 30 = \$1500
  \]

- Therefore, total revenue from all cards:

  \[
  \text{Total revenue} = \$4000 + \$1500 = \$5500
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Profit
Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total spending.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total spending}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = \$5500 - \$5400 = \$100
\]

### Final Answer
Mark made a profit of $\boxed{100}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","The cheaper cards are worth a total of 30*50=$<<30*50=1500>>1500

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Jake's family can save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for both parks and then find the difference between these costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park**

- Number of adults = 2
- Cost per adult at the first park = $26
- Number of children = 2
- Cost per child at the first park = $12

Total cost for the first amusement park:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of adults} \times \text{Cost per adult}) + (\text{Number of children} \times \text{Cost per child})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (2 \times 26) + (2 \times 12)
\]

Calculate each term separately:

\[
2 \times 26 = 52
\]
\[
2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Add them together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 52 + 24 = 76
\]

So, the total cost for the first amusement park is $76.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park**

- Number of adults = 2
- Cost per adult at the second park = $14
- Number of children = 2
- Cost per child at the second park = $10

Total cost for the second amusement park:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of adults} \times \text{Cost per adult}) + (\text{Number of children} \times \text{Cost per child})
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = (2 \times 14) + (2 \times 10)
\]

Calculate each term separately:

\[
2 \times 14 = 28
\]
\[
2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Add them together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 28 + 20 = 48
\]

So, the total cost for the second amusement park is $48.

**Step 3: Determine the savings**

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park instead of the first one, subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost of first park} - \text{Total cost of second park}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Savings} = 76 - 48 = 28
\]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save **$28** by choosing the second amusement park over the first.<|im_end|>","The two adults pay $26 x 2 = $<<26*2=52>>52 for the first amusement park.
While the two children's tickets cost $12 x 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24 for the first amusement park.
So, they will pay a total of $52 + $24 = $<<52+24=76>>76 for the first amusement park.
The two adults pay $14 x 2 = $<<14*2=28>>28 for the second amusement park.
While the two children's tickets for the second amusement park cost $10 x 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.
So, they will pay a total of $28 + $20 = $<<28+20=48>>48 for the second amusement park.

                    A tomato vendor decides to switch who he buys his tomatoes for.  He sells 500 tomatoes a day.  He used to buy them for $.5 each but he gets ; a new vendor who sells ? them for $.4 each.  How much money does he save a week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves per week after switching vendors, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor.
2. Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor.
3. Find the difference between the two costs to determine the savings.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor**

The vendor used to buy tomatoes at $0.50 each and sold 500 tomatoes per day.

\[
\text{Total Cost (Old Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Price per Tomato}
\]
\[
= 500 \times \$0.50
\]
\[
= \$250
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying tomatoes from the new vendor**

The new vendor sells tomatoes at $0.40 each.

\[
\text{Total Cost (New Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Price per Tomato}
\]
\[
= 500 \times \$0.40
\]
\[
= \$200
\]

**Step 3: Find the difference in costs**

Now, subtract the cost from the new vendor from the cost from the old vendor to find out how much more was spent on the old vendor.

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost from Old Vendor} - \text{Cost from New Vendor}
\]
\[
= \$250 - \$200
\]
\[
= \$50
\]

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves **$50** per week by switching to the new vendor.<|im_end|>","He buys 500*7=<<500*7=3500>>3500
He used to pay 3500*.5=$<<3500*.5=1750>>1750

                    question:
                    Carl has ! four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean : has half as many marbles ! as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, how many marbles do Carl : and Cal have combined?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of marbles Carl and Cal have based on the information given about Sean's marbles.

1. **Identify the relationship between Sean's and Carl's marbles:**
   - Sean has twice as many marbles as Carl.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of marbles Carl has.
   - Therefore, Sean has \( 2C \) marbles.

2. **Use the information about Sean's marbles:**
   - We know that Sean has 56 marbles.
   - So, \( 2C = 56 \).

3. **Solve for Carl's marbles:**
   - To find out how many marbles Carl has, divide both sides of the equation by 2.
   - \( C = \frac{56}{2} = 28 \).
   - Thus, Carl has 28 marbles.

4. **Calculate Cal's marbles:**
   - Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and Sean has 56 marbles, then Carl has \( 4 \times 56 \).
   - Calculating this gives us \( 4 \times 56 = 224 \).
   - Hence, Cal has 224 marbles.

5. **Combine their total marbles:**
   - Now, add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have together.
   - \( 28 + 224 = 252 \).

### Conclusion:
Carl and Cal have combined 252 marbles.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 252.<|im_end|>","Cal has 56*2 = <<56*2=112>>112 marbles.
Carl has 4*56 = <<4*56=224>>224 marbles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total number of chairs Candy can rent out over two 4-week months, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate weekly rentals for one week (5 days)
- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
  - Number of chairs rented per weekday = 60
  - Number of weekdays in a week = 5
  - Total chairs rented on weekdays in one week = \( 60 \times 5 \)

\[
60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ chairs}
\]

- **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
  - Number of chairs rented per weekend day = 100
  - Number of weekend days in a week = 2
  - Total chairs rented on weekends in one week = \( 100 \times 2 \)

\[
100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ chairs}
\]

- **Total chairs rented in one week:**

\[
300 + 200 = 500 \text{ chairs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate weekly rentals for two weeks (two 4-week months)
Since there are 2 weeks in two 4-week months, multiply the weekly total by 2.

\[
500 \times 2 = 1000 \text{ chairs}
\]

### Final Answer:
Candy will be able to rent out a total of **1000 chairs** in two 4-week months.<|im_end|>","During weekdays, a total of 60 x 5 = <<60*5=300>>300 chairs are rented.
During the weekends, a total of 100 x 2 = <<100*2=200>>200 chairs are rented.
In a week, 300 + 200 = <<300+200=500>>500 chairs are rented.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, 500 x 4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 chairs are rented in a month.
Thus, a total of 2000 x 2 = <<2000*2=4000>>4000 chairs are rented in two months.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's solve this step by step:

1. Initially, Gunther has 48 bananas.

2. Arnold steals half of these bananas:
   - Total bananas: 48
   - Half stolen: \( \frac{48}{2} = 24 \)
   - Bananas left after Arnold's theft: \( 48 - 24 = 24 \)

3. Gunther adds 25 more bananas:
   - New total: \( 24 + 25 = 49 \)

4. Arnold steals some more bananas:
   - Total bananas: 49
   - Number stolen: \( \frac{49}{2} \approx 24.5 \) (since it can only be an integer, we'll round down to 24 for simplicity)
   - Bananas left after Arnold's second theft: \( 49 - 24 = 25 \)

5. Gunther adds 6 more bananas:
   - New total: \( 25 + 6 = 31 \)

So, at the end, Gunther finds there are 31 bananas in the pile.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 31 bananas.<|im_end|>","Half of 48 bananas is 48/2=<<48/2=24>>24 bananas.

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total monthly cost of electricity.
Jenna's monthly electricity bill is $100.

### Step 2: Determine the number of months in a year.
There are 12 months in a year.

### Step 3: Calculate the total annual cost of electricity.
Total annual cost = Monthly cost × Number of months in a year
\[ \text{Total annual cost} = \$100 \times 12 \]

### Step 4: Divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates.
Each roommate shares the cost equally among themselves. Therefore, we divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates (which is 4).

Let's perform these calculations now:

1. **Total annual cost**:
   \[ \$100 \times 12 = \$1200 \]

2. **Cost per roommate per year**:
   \[ \frac{\$1200}{4} = \$300 \]

So, each roommate will pay \( \$300 \) per year for electricity.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses initially sent.
Jeff sends 8 dozen glasses. Since one dozen equals 12, we calculate:
\[ 8 \text{ dozen} \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of plates initially sent.
Jeff also sends 4 dozen plates. Similarly, since one dozen equals 12, we calculate:
\[ 4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates} \]

### Step 3: Determine how many glasses are returned.
According to the information given, 10 glasses are broken during the return process.

### Step 4: Determine how many plates are returned.
Similarly, according to the information given, 6 plates are broken during the return process.

\[ 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses remaining} \]
- For plates:
\[ 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates remaining} \]

### Step 6: Add up the remaining items after the return.
- Total glasses left: \( 86 \)
- Total plates left: \( 42 \)

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track how many stickers and buttons Lorraine has at different stages of her trade.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.
   - Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.
   
2. **Trade Plan:**

   - **First Trade (Large Stickers):**
     - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
     - Percentage traded = \(90\% \) of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
     - Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, Lorraine can get \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons from these small stickers.
     
     After this trade:
     - Remaining small stickers = \(30 - 27 = 3\).
     - Large stickers left = \(40 - 27 = 13\).

   - **Second Trade (Small Stickers):**
     - Lorraine trades 50% of her remaining large stickers for large buttons.
     - Percentage traded = \(50\% \) of 13 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 13 = 6.5\) large stickers.
     - Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, Lorraine can get \( \frac{6.5}{3} = 2.1667 \approx 2 \) large buttons from these large stickers.
     
     After this trade:
     - Large stickers left = \(13 - 6.5 = 6.5 \approx 7\) large stickers.
     - Small stickers left = \(3 - 2 = 1\).

   - **Third Trade (Small Stickers):**
     - Lorraine trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons.
     - Number of large stickers left = 7.
     - Since each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, Lorraine can get \(7 \times 3 = 21\) small buttons from these large stickers.
     
     After this trade:
     - Small stickers left = 1.
     - Buttons obtained = \(21\).

3. **Total Buttons:**
   - Total buttons obtained = Buttons from first trade + Buttons from second trade + Buttons from third trade.
   - Total buttons obtained = \(9 + 2 + 21 = 32\).

To determine how many matches Joey played last week, we need to break down the information given:

1. **Total Matches Played**: We know that Joey played a total of 7 matches (since it's mentioned ""in one week"").

2. **Matches on Monday**: Joey played 2 matches on Monday.

3. **Match on Friday**: Joey played 1 match on Friday.

4. **Match on Saturday**: On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of matches played during the other days (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday).

- **Tuesday**: Let’s denote the number of matches Joey played on Tuesday as \(x\).
- **Wednesday**: Let’s denote the number of matches Joey played on Wednesday as \(y\).
- **Thursday**: Let’s denote the number of matches Joey played on Thursday as \(z\).
- **Sunday**: Let’s denote the number of matches Joey played on Sunday as \(w\).

Since Joey only played on these five days, the sum of all matches played over those five days should equal the total number of matches played last week, which is 7.

So far, we have:
\[ x + y + z + w = 5 \]

Given that Joey played more than 2 matches on Monday, we can assume that \(x > 0\). However, since there are no restrictions or additional details about the matches played on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday, we will consider them as potential scenarios but not necessary for calculating the exact number of matches played on each day.

Finally, adding up the matches from Monday to Saturday gives us:
\[ 2 (\text{Monday}) + 1 (\text{Friday}) + 4 (\text{Saturday}) = 7 \]

Thus, Joey played exactly 7 matches last week, confirming our calculation.

**Final Answer:**

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( F \) represent the number of votes in favor.
   Let \( A \) represent the number of votes against.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   According to the problem, ""twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it."" This can be written as:
   \[
   F = 2A
   \]

3. **Sum of All Votes:**
   Since every member voted either for or against, the total sum of all votes must equal the total number of people in the council. Therefore,
   \[
   F + A = 33
   \]

4. **Substitute into Equation:**
   Substitute \( F = 2A \) from Step 2 into the equation from Step 3:
   \[
   2A + A = 33
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   3A = 33
   \]

5. **Solve for \( A \):**
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   A = \frac{33}{3} = 11
   \]

6. **Find \( F \):**
   Now that we know \( A \), use the relationship \( F = 2A \):
   \[
   F = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

                    question:
                    Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool ! students. 11 ? students need ! size extra-small.  Twice as many students need ? size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. ,  ? Half as many students need size large as size medium.  Six more students need size extra-large than large.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of students needing different sizes:**
   - We know that there are 11 students who need extra-small shirts.
   - The number of students needing small shirts is twice the number of extra-small shirts.
     \[
     \text{Small shirts} = 2 \times \text{Extra-small shirts} = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]
   - The number of students needing medium shirts is four less than the number of small shirts.
     \[
     \text{Medium shirts} = \text{Small shirts} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
     \]
   - The number of students needing large shirts is half the number of medium shirts.
     \[
     \text{Large shirts} = \frac{\text{Medium shirts}}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   - The number of students needing extra-large shirts is six more than the number of large shirts.
     \[
     \text{Extra-large shirts} = \text{Large shirts} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of shirts needed:**
   - Add up all the shirts needed for each size.
     \[
     \text{Total shirts} = \text{Extra-small shirts} + \text{Small shirts} + \text{Medium shirts} + \text{Large shirts} + \text{Extra-large shirts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Krissa needs to order a total of 75 shirts.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]<|im_end|>","Krissa ordered 11 x 2 = <<11*2=22>>22 size small.

She ordered 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 size extra-large.
Altogether, Krissa ordered 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = <<11+22+18+9+15=75>>75 shirts.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the discount amount.
- The original price of the item is $140.
- The discount rate is 5%.

Calculation for the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$140 \times \left(\frac{5}{100}\right) \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$7 \]

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$140 - \$7 \]
\[ \text{Discounted Price} = \$133 \]

Therefore, after applying the 5% discount, the final price you will pay is **$133**.<|im_end|>","The discount amounts to $140 x 5/100 = $<<140*5/100=7>>7.

To determine the total duration of all the playlists combined, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the length of one playlist:**
   Each playlist contains 300 songs.
   
2. **Determine the length of one song:**
   Each song is 10 hours long.

3. **Calculate the total length for one playlist:**
   Multiply the number of songs per playlist by the length of each song.
   \[

4. **Calculate the total length for all playlists:**
   Since there are 20 playlists, multiply the total length of one playlist by the number of playlists.
   \[
   \text{Total length for all playlists} = 3000 \text{ hours/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists}

3. Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining group.
4. Find out how many people think horse #12 will win.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win
- We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win.
\[ \text{Number of people} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of people left after accounting for those thinking about horse #2
- Subtract the number of people who think horse #2 will win from the total number of people.
\[ \text{Remaining people} = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining group
- We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win.
\[ \text{Number of people} = 40 \times 0.60 = 24 \]

### Step 4: Find out how many people think horse #12 will win
- Subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people.
\[ \text{Number of people} = 40 - 24 = 16 \]

                    Two thirds of Jana's puppies ; are Pomeranians. One third of the Pomeranians are girls. If there are 6 Pomeranian girls, how many puppies does Jana have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of puppies:**
   - We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.
   - There are 6 Pomeranian girls.

2. **Determine the number of Pomeranian girls:**
   - Since one third of the Pomeranians equals 6, we can set up an equation to find the total number of Pomeranians (let's call this \(P\)):
     \[
     \frac{1}{3}P = 6
     \]
   - Solving for \(P\):
     \[
     P = 6 \times 3 = 18
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of puppies:**
   - We know two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   - Therefore, if 18 are Pomeranians, then the total number of puppies (\(T\)) must be such that two-thirds of them equal 18:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}T = 18
     \]
   - Solving for \(T\):
     \[
     T = 18 \div \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 18 \times \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = 27
     \]

4. **Verify the calculations:**
   - Check if the calculation makes sense in terms of the given information:
     - One third of 27 puppies are Pomeranians: \(\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9\) Pomeranians.
     - Two-thirds of 27 puppies are Pomeranians: \(\frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18\) Pomeranians.
     - The remaining puppies (which should be non-Pomeranans) would be \(\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9\) puppies, but since they aren't specified as non-Pomeranans, their count doesn't affect our current calculation.

Therefore, the total number of puppies Jana has is 27.

To determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate how much allowance Ava gives Jayden.
2. Add this amount to Jayden's initial $70.
3. Subtract the cost of the camera ($200) from the total amount Jayden has.

Step 1: Calculate allowance from Ava.
Ava's allowance = $90
Ava gives half of her allowance to Jayden:
Half of $90 = $45

Step 2: Add this amount to Jayden's initial $70.
Jayden's total after receiving allowance:
$70 + $45 = $115

Step 3: Subtract the cost of the camera ($200) from the total amount Jayden has.
Total needed for the camera:

If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, ? with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and ! the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house ; need?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let's denote:
- \( S_1 \) as the number of cases needed for the first home.
- \( S_2 \) as the number of cases needed for the second home.
- \( S_3 \) as the number of cases needed for the third home.

We know from the problem statement that:
- The total number of cases needed for all three homes is 250.
- The first home needs half of what the second home needs (\( S_1 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 \)).
- The third home needs double what the first home needs (\( S_3 = 2 S_1 \)).

### Step 2: Express Everything in Terms of One Variable
From the given relationships, we can express \( S_1 \), \( S_2 \), and \( S_3 \) in terms of one variable (let's use \( S_2 \)):
- Since \( S_1 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 \), then \( S_1 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 \).
- And since \( S_3 = 2 S_1 \), substituting \( S_1 \) gives \( S_3 = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2} S_2\right) = S_2 \).

So now we have:
\[ S_1 = \frac{1}{2} S_2 \]
\[ S_3 = S_2 \]

### Step 3: Set Up an Equation Based on Total Cases Needed
Since the total number of cases needed for all three homes is 250, we can write:
\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 250 \]

Substituting \( S_1 \) and \( S_3 \) in terms of \( S_2 \):
\[ \frac{1}{2} S_2 + S_2 + S_2 = 250 \]

Simplify this equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} S_2 + S_2 + S_2 = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} S_2 + 2 S_2 = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} S_2 + \frac{4}{2} S_2 = 250 \]
\[ \frac{5}{2} S_2 = 250 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( S_2 \)
Multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{5} \) to isolate \( S_2 \):
\[ S_2 = \frac{2}{5} \times 250 \]
\[ S_2 = 100 \]

### Step 5: Find \( S_3 \)
Now that we know \( S_2 \), we can find \( S_3 \):
\[ S_3 = S_2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third home will need **100** cases of shingles.<|im_end|>","Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house

   - We know that George has 45% more pears than bananas.
   - George has 200 bananas.

2. **Calculate the increase in the number of pears:**
   - Since there are 45% more pears, we calculate 45% of the number of bananas (which is 200).
   
   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]

3. **Add the increase to the original number of bananas to find the total number of pears:**
   - The original number of bananas is 200, so we add the calculated increase (90) to it.

   \[
   200 + 90 = 290

<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total amount spent:**
   - Marissa spends $20 on the ball.
   - She has $80 initially.

   Therefore, the total amount spent = $20 (ball) + remaining ($80 - $20) = $60.

2. **Calculate the cost per candy bar:**
   - Each candy bar costs $5.

3. **Determine the number of candy bars purchased:**
   - To find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with her remaining money after buying the ball,
     we divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the price of one candy bar.

So, if Marissa buys candies, she will spend all or most of her remaining money on candy bars. 

4. **Divide the total amount spent on candy bars by the price of one candy bar:**

\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent on candy bars}}{\text{Price of one candy bar}}
\]

Since we know that Marissa spent all or most of her remaining money on candy bars, let's assume she spent exactly all her remaining money on them. Then,

\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{60}{5}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Number of candy bars} = 12
\]

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy. 

Hence, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 12.<|im_end|>","If Marissa had $80 on her and used $20 to buy a ball, she remained with $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much money Sam would need to make 4 liters of juice, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per kilogram of oranges**
Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges for 1 liter of juice.
Each kilogram costs $3.

Cost per kilogram = $3

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 4 liters of juice**
First, find out how many kilograms of oranges are needed for 4 liters.

Since 1 liter requires 5 kilograms,
For 4 liters, we multiply this amount by 4.

Total kilograms for 4 liters = 5 kg/liter * 4 liters = 20 kg

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 20 kilograms of oranges**
Now that we know the total kilograms required (20 kg), we can calculate the total cost.

Cost per kilogram = $3

Total cost for 20 kg = 20 kg * $3/kg = $60

Therefore, Sam would need **$60** to buy enough oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $60.<|im_end|>","To make 4 liters of juice, Sam needs 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 kilograms of oranges.
If one kilogram of oranges costs $3, then 20 kilograms would cost 20 * 3 = $<<20*3=60>>60.

                    question:
                    In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. , Ezra has read 300 books ! this hour and decided to read 150 more. ; How many books . have they read altogether?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many books Ahmed read in that hour.
Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in that hour, and Ezra read 300 books, we can set up an equation where \( E \) represents the number of books Ezra read and \( A \) represents the number of books Ahmed read.

\[ E = 2A \]

Given \( E = 300 \), we substitute:

\[ 300 = 2A \]

Solving for \( A \):

\[ A = \frac{300}{2} \]
\[ A = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of books both have read together after the additional reading.
Ezra decides to read 150 more books after his initial reading. Therefore, the total number of books he reads is:

\[ E_{total} = E + 150 \]
\[ E_{total} = 300 + 150 \]
\[ E_{total} = 450 \]

Ahmed's new reading session would be:

\[ A_{new} = A + 150 \]
\[ A_{new} = 150 + 150 \]
\[ A_{new} = 300 \]

Step 3: Add the total number of books read by both.
Now, let's add the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed:

Total Books Read Altogether = \( E_{total} + A_{new} \)
\[ Total\ Books\ Read\ Altogether = 450 + 300 \]
\[ Total\ Books\ Read\ Altogether = 750 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: The total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is 750.<|im_end|>","If Ezra has read 300 books this hour and decided to read 150 more in the next hour, he has read a total of 300+150=<<300+150=450>>450

Together, Ahmed and Ezra has read 225+450=<<225+450=675>>675 books

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Tanya earned on both Monday and Wednesday separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from Monday**

- Tanya teaches 4 classes.
- Each class lasts for 5 hours.
- Tanya earns $15 for each hour.
- Additional bonus for teaching more than 3 classes ($5 per day).

First, let's calculate her total earning from the classes:

\[ \text{Total earning from classes} = 4 \times 5 \times \$15 \]

Next, let's calculate the bonus:

\[ \text{Bonus for teaching more than 3 classes} = \$5 \]

Now, add the bonus to the total earning from the classes:

\[ \text{Earnings on Monday} = (\text{Total earning from classes}) + (\text{Bonus}) \]

Let's do the calculations:

\[ \text{Total earning from classes} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = 60 \times 15 = 900 \]

Since she taught 4 classes which is more than 3, she gets the bonus:

\[ \text{Bonus} = 5 \]

So, her total earnings on Monday:

\[ \text{Earnings on Monday} = 900 + 5 = 905 \]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from Wednesday**

- Tanya teaches 2 classes.
- Each class lasts for 2 hours.
- Tanya earns $15 for each hour.
- No additional bonus since she only taught 2 classes (which is not more than 3).

Now, let's calculate her total earning from the classes:

\[ \text{Total earning from classes} = 2 \times 2 \times \$15 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from the classes:

\[ \text{Earnings from classes} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = 4 \times 15 = 60 \]

Since there is no bonus, her earnings from the classes alone will be the same as her total earning from the classes.

**Step 3: Sum up the earnings from both days**

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings on Monday} + \text{Earnings on Wednesday} \]

Substitute the values we calculated:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 905 + 60 = 965 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tanya earned over the two days of teaching is:

\[
\boxed{965}
\]<|im_end|>","Tanya worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = <<5+2=7>>7 hours.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of vanilla scents sold:**
   - The company has 4 vanilla scents.
   - Each vanilla scent was sold 5 times.
   \[
   \text{Total vanilla scents sold} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

2. **Identify the total number of fruity scents sold:**
   - The company has 8 fruity scents.
   - Each fruity scent was sold 2 times.
   \[
   \text{Total fruity scents sold} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in sales between vanilla and fruity scents:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total vanilla scents sold} - \text{Total fruity scents sold}
   \]
   Substituting the values calculated above,
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per ear of corn that Bennet should sell so that he reaches his goal of making a total of $135.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
Bennet sold 20 eggplants at $3 each.
\[ \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = \$60 \]

Step 2: Determine the remaining amount needed after selling the eggplants.
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn.
Since Bennet has 25 ears of corn and he needs to raise $75 from these ears, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears.
\[ \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\$75}{25} = \$3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final answer is: The final answer is $\boxed{3}$.<|im_end|>","From his eggplants, Bennet makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60

<|im_start|>superior
To determine the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total available time.
- **Saturday**: 7 hours
- **Sunday**: 5! hours (note: this should be interpreted as 5 hours)
- **Total time** = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

### Step 2: Determine the remaining time after accounting for reading and video gaming.

First, calculate the time spent on reading:
- Reading = 3 hours

Next, calculate the time spent on video games:
- Video games = 1/3 * Remaining time

Since the total time is 12 hours, the remaining time after reading is:
- Remaining time after reading = Total time - Reading time = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

Now, let's find out how much time is left for video games:
- Time left for video games = 1/3 * Remaining time after reading = 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours

So, the time spent on video games is 3 hours.

### Step 3: Subtract the time spent on reading and video games from the total time to find the time spent on soccer.

- Soccer time = Total time - (Reading time + Video games time) = 12 - (3 + 3) = 6 hours

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer.

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent on soccer}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplify:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = 50\% \]

<|im_start|>user
To determine how many pencils Anthony keeps, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pencils given to Brandon.
Anthony initially has 50 pencils.

- He gives half (1/2) of his pencils to Brandon.
\[ \text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

After giving away 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \] pencils left.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils given to Charlie.
- From the remaining 25 pencils, Anthony gives 3/5 of them to Charlie.
\[ \text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \]

After giving away 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \] pencils left.

### Step 3: Determine how many pencils Anthony keeps.
Since all the pencils given to Charlie were from the remaining 25 pencils after giving some to Brandon, and Anthony does not give any more pencils after this point, we can conclude that Anthony keeps exactly 10 pencils.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]<|im_end|>","Brandon received 50 x 1/2 = <<50*1/2=25>>25 pencils

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent driving:**
   - The distance to the museum is 150 miles.
   - Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph.

   Using the formula for time (time = distance / speed), we can calculate the total driving time as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}}
   \]
   Simplifying this gives us:
   \[
   \text{Time driving} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the total travel time including the return trip:**
   - Since the journey is round-trip, the total travel time will be twice the time spent on one-way drive.
   - Therefore, the total travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Total travel time} = 2 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Account for the time spent at the museum:**
   - Jack spends 6 hours at the museum.

4. **Calculate the total time Jack is away from home:**
   - We now add the time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.
   - Total time away = Time driving + Time at museum
   \[
   \text{Total time away} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the final answer is that Jack is gone from home for \(10\) hours.<|im_end|>","He drove a total of 150+150=<<150+150=300>>300 miles

\text{Number of movies not in series} = 600 - 200 = 400
\]

#### 2. Calculate the cost for the movies that are not in series.
Out of the 400 non-series movies, 40% are older movies. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of older movies} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160
\]
The remaining 60% are newer movies from series. Therefore, the cost for these movies will be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Cost per new movie from series} = \$10
\]
So, the total cost for all the movies not in series is:
\[
\text{Total cost for non-series movies} = 160 \times \$10 = \$1600
\]

#### 3. Calculate the cost for the movies in series.
A third of the total movies are in series. So, the number of movies in series is:
\[
\text{Number of movies in series} = \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200
\]
For the series, there is a discount of $6 for every $10 spent on regular movies. Let \(x\) be the total cost for the series movies. The cost per movie in series is then:
\[
\text{Cost per movie in series} = \frac{x}{200}
\]
Given that this equals $\$6$, we have:
\[
\frac{x}{200} = 6 \implies x = 6 \times 200 = \$1200
\]

#### 4. Calculate the total cost.
Now, we add up the costs for both types of movies:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for non-series movies} + \text{Cost for series movies} = \$1600 + \$1200 = \$2800
\]

Thus, the total cost of replacing the movies is:
\[
\boxed{\$2800}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 600/3=<<600/3=200>>200 movies in series

                    question:
                    At the local Pick Your Own fruit orchard, you could pick . your own peaches for $2.00 per pound, ! plums were $1.00 per pound and apricots were $3.00 per pound.  If Winston picked 6 pounds of ; peaches, 8 pounds of plums and 6 pounds of apricots, how much did he spend on fruit?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Winston spent on his fruits, we need to calculate the cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of peaches
- Cost per pound of peaches = $2.00
- Number of pounds of peaches = 6 pounds

\[
\text{Total cost for peaches} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for peaches} = \$2.00 \times 6 = \$12.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of plums
- Cost per pound of plums = $1.00
- Number of pounds of plums = 8 pounds

\[
\text{Total cost for plums} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for plums} = \$1.00 \times 8 = \$8.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of apricots
- Cost per pound of apricots = $3.00
- Number of pounds of apricots = 6 pounds

\[
\text{Total cost for apricots} = \text{Cost per pound} \times \text{Number of pounds}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for apricots} = \$3.00 \times 6 = \$18.00
\]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for peaches} + \text{Total cost for plums} + \text{Total cost for apricots}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

### Final Answer:
Winston spent a total of $\boxed{\$38.00}$ on his fruits.<|im_end|>","He bought 6 pounds of peaches that are $2.00 per pound so he spent 6*2 = $<<6*2=12.00>>12.00 on peaches

                    question:
                    The Llesis family drove and hiked ! 6 hours to their vacation spot. They drove an average : of 50 miles per hour and hiked an average of ; 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive. If it took them 1.5 hours to hike, how far was their vacation spot?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the driving distance:**
   - The total time spent on the trip (driving + hiking) is 6 hours.
   - It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

2. **Calculate the time spent driving:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent hiking}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time spent driving} = 6 \text{ hours} - 1.5 \text{ hours} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average speed while driving:**
   - The average speed while driving is 50 miles per hour.

4. **Calculate the driving distance:**
   \[
   \text{Driving distance} = \text{Average speed} \times \text{Time spent driving}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Driving distance} = 50 \text{ mph} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Determine the hiking speed:**
   - Hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half the driving speed.
   - Driving speed = 50 mph
   - Half of the driving speed:
     \[
     \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ mph}
     \]
   - Therefore, the hiking speed:
     \[
     25 \text{ mph} - 5 \text{ mph} = 20 \text{ mph}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   - Total distance traveled = Distance driven + Distance hiked
   - Distance hiked = Speed * Time
   \[
   \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ mph} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]
   - Therefore, the total distance:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Driving distance} + \text{Distance hiked}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The total distance from the starting point to the vacation spot is 255 miles.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{255 \text{ miles}}
\]<|im_end|>","Half the average speed of Llesis family driving is 50/2 = <<50/2=25>>25 miles per hour.

So, they hiked 20 x 1.5 = <<20*1.5=30>>30 miles.
It took them a total of 6 - 1.5 = <<6-1.5=4.5>>4.5 hours driving.
So, they drove 50 x 4.5 = <<50*4.5=225>>225 miles.
Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 + 225 = <<30+225=255>>255 miles far.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate Ava's Score
- **Points from jumping on enemies**: 8 enemies * 10 points = 80 points.
- **Points from collecting berries**: 3 berries * 5 points per berry = 15 points.
- **Total points from jumping and collecting**: 80 + 15 = 95 points.

So, Ava's total score is 95 points.

### Step 2: Calculate Emma's Score
- **Points from jumping on enemies**: Emma doesn't jump on any enemies, so she gets no points from this category.
- **Points from collecting berries**: Emma collects 3 berries * 5 points per berry = 15 points.
- **Points from time**: Emma finished the level 4 seconds slower than Ava. For every second lost, you lose 30/4 = 7.5 points (since we can't have half a point). Since there are 4 seconds lost, Emma loses 7.5 points.

So, Emma's total score is 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 points.

### Step 3: Determine the Difference in Scores
Now that we have both scores, we can find the difference:
- Ava's score: 95 points.
- Emma's score: 7.5 points.

Difference = 95 - 7.5 = 87.5 points.

### Final Answer
The difference between their scores is 87.5 points. Therefore, Ava has a higher score, making her the winner.<|im_end|>","For jumping on enemies, Emma earns 8 * 10 = <<8*10=80>>80 fewer points than Ava.
For collecting berries, Emma earns 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 fewer points than Ava.
For finishing the level faster, Emma earns 4 * 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 more points than Ava.
Overall, Emma has 120 – 80 - 15 = <<120-80-15=25>>25 more points than Ava.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total cost and the known quantities:**
   - Total cost of pizzas = $64
   - Cost of two pizzas = $30 (given)

2. **Calculate the remaining cost to be split between the other two pizzas:**
   - Remaining cost after buying two pizzas = $64 - $30 = $34

3. **Determine how many different ways the remaining $34 can be split among the three unknown costs:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the cost of one of the other two pizzas.
   - Since all three pizzas have the same cost, we need to find an equal division.

4. **Set up the equation based on the remaining cost being equally divided among the three pizzas:**
   - The sum of the three identical costs should equal the remaining $34.
   - Therefore, \( 3x = 34 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 7 fish in his pond.
   - Out of these, 3 are orange, and 4 are white.

2. **Fish Purchased from Pet Store**:
   - The sales assistant at the pet store takes out 17 fish from a mixed tank containing both white and orange fish.

3. **Total Fish After Purchase**:
   - After adding the 17 fish back to his pond, Bob now has \(7 + 17 = 24\) fish.

4. **Number of Orange and White Fish**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of white fish bought from the store.
   - Therefore, the total number of white fish after buying additional ones would be \(4 + x\).

5. **Equation for Total Fish**:
   - The total number of fish in the pond should equal 24: 
     \[
     4 + x + (24 - (4 + x)) = 24
     \]
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     4 + x + 20 - x = 24
     \]

6. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     24 = 24
     \]
   - This confirms our equation is correct but does not directly help us find \(x\). Instead, we know that the total number of fish must match the sum of the initial and purchased fish:
     \[
     4 + x + (24 - (4 + x)) = 24
     \]
   - Since the left side simplifies correctly to 24, it implies:
     \[
     4 + x = 20
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 20 - 4
     \]
     \[
     x = 16
     \]

Therefore, Bob bought 16 white fish at the store.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much money Andy spends on gas in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of miles Andy drives in a week:**
   - Andy goes to work from Monday to Friday.
   - There are 5 days in a workweek.
   - The distance from his home to his office is 5 miles one way.

   \[
   \text{Total miles driven} = \text{Number of days per week} \times \text{Distance per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total miles driven} = 5 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ miles/day} = 25 \text{ miles/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of gas used per week:**
   - Andy's car has an EPA fuel efficiency of 10 MPG (Miles Per Gallon).
   - To find out how many gallons of gas he consumes per week, divide the total miles driven by the fuel efficiency.

   \[
   \text{Gallons of gas consumed per week} = \frac{\text{Total miles driven}}{\text{Fuel efficiency}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons of gas consumed per week} = \frac{25 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ MPG}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons of gas consumed per week} = 2.5 \text{ gallons/week}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weekly cost of gas:**
   - The price of regular gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Multiply the gallons of gas consumed per week by the price per gallon.

   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of gas} = \text{Gallons of gas consumed per week} \times \text{Price per gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of gas} = 2.5 \text{ gallons/week} \times \$3/\text{gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost of gas} = \$7.50
   \]

                    question:
                    Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, , calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Carrie has in total and then figure out how much she spent on lunch.

### Step 1: Calculate the value of the twenty dollars
Carrie received $20 bills from her aunt. Since there are 10 twenty-dollar bills, we can find the total value of these bills as follows:

\[ \text{Total Value} = 10 \times \$20 \]

Calculate the total value:

\[
10 \times 20 = 200
\]

So, the total value of the twenty-dollar bills is $200.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of the quarters
Carrie also received quarters from her aunt. Each quarter is worth $\frac{1}{4}$ of a dollar (since there are four quarters in a dollar). She received 140 quarters. We can find the total value of these quarters as follows:

\[ \text{Value per Quarter} = \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ \text{Total Value of Quarters} = 140 \times \frac{1}{4} \]

Calculate the total value of the quarters:

\[
140 \times \frac{1}{4} = 35
\]

So, the total value of the quarters is $35.

### Step 3: Determine how much money Carrie spent on lunch
According to the problem, Carrie spent all the quarters ($35) and three-fifths of the twenty-dollar bills ($200).

First, let's calculate three-fifths of the twenty-dollar bills:

\[
\text{Amount Spent on Twenties} = \frac{3}{5} \times 200
\]

Calculate the amount spent on the twenty-dollar bills:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{600}{5} = 120
\]

So, the amount spent on the twenty-dollar bills is $120.

Next, add the value of the quarters to the amount spent on the twenty-dollar bills:

\[
\text{Total Amount Spent on Lunch} = 35 + 120
\]

Calculate the total amount spent on lunch:

\[
35 + 120 = 155
\]

### Conclusion
Carrie spent a total of $155 on lunch.

Thus, the final answer is {The final answer is}: $155.<|im_end|>","Since she spent all the quarters, she paid her lunch partly by quarters totaling 140*$0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tomatoes and eggplants that Ricardo can harvest from his plants.

Step 1: Calculate the total yield of tomatoes.
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo has 5 tomato plants.

Total yield of tomatoes = Number of tomato plants × Yield per tomato plant
= 5 × 22
= 110 tomatoes

Step 2: Calculate the total yield of eggplants.
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants.

Total yield of eggplants = Number of eggplant plants × Yield per eggplant plant
= 8 × 4
= 32 eggplants

Step 3: Add the total yield of tomatoes and eggplants together.
Total fruit yield = Total yield of tomatoes + Total yield of eggplants
= 110 + 32
= 142 fruits

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} 142 fruits.<|im_end|>","Ricardo can get 22 x 5 = <<22*5=110>>110 tomatoes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of OLED TVs sold based on the given percentages and total sales.

1. **Identify the total sales**:
   - Total sales = 40 TVs

2. **Determine the percentage for each type of TV**:
   - Smart TVs: \( \frac{1}{4} \) or 25%
   - Analog TVs: \( \frac{1}{8} \) or 12.5%

3. **Calculate the number of each type of TV sold**:
   - Number of smart TVs = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \)
   - Number of analog TVs = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \)

4. **Subtract the known quantities from the total to find the number of OLED TVs**:
   - Number of OLED TVs = Total sales - (Number of smart TVs + Number of analog TVs)
     \[
     \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
     \]

Therefore, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs.<|im_end|>","Samwell was able to sell 1/4 x 40 = <<1/4*40=10>>10 Smart TVs.
He was able to sell 1/8 x 40 = <<1/8*40=5>>5 analog TVs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
To determine how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount needed for the trip.
2. Determine how much the school will contribute.
3. Subtract the school's contribution from the total amount needed.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount needed for the trip
The cost of the trip is given as $300.

### Step 2: Determine how much the school will contribute
The school decides to cover half the cost of the trip. So, we calculate half of $300.

\[ \text{School's Contribution} = \frac{\$300}{2} = \$150 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the school's contribution from the total amount needed
John already has $50. We subtract the school's contribution from this amount.

\[ \text{Money John Missing} = \$50 - (\$150 + \$50) \]
\[ \text{Money John Missing} = \$50 - \$200 \]
\[ \text{Money John Missing} = -\$150 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that John actually has more than enough money to cover the trip costs. Therefore, he does not miss any money at all.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}. John has no money missing. He even has extra funds left over.<|im_end|>","John's school has decided to pay 300 / 2 = $<<300/2=150>>150 for his trip.

                    question:
                    Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the ; temperature inside the , house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns ? heats the house up by 5 degrees.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. The house freezes at 32°F.
2. Each log of wood increases the temperature by 5°F.
3. At noon (daytime), the temperature is 45°F.
4. At nighttime (night), the temperature drops to 33°F.

First, we need to determine the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures:

- Daytime temperature: 45°F
- Nighttime temperature: 33°F

Difference = 45°F - 33°F = 12°F

Now, we know that each log of wood raises the temperature by 5°F. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 12°F, we divide the total temperature increase needed by the temperature rise per log:

Number of logs needed = Difference / Temperature rise per log
= 12°F / 5°F/log
= 2.4 logs

Since you can't burn part of a log, Carson needs to round up to the next whole number because even a fraction of a log would still be effective in preventing the pipes from freezing.

Therefore, Carson needs to burn **3** logs to ensure the temperature remains above 32°F throughout the night.<|im_end|>","First find the night-time temperature: 45 degrees - 33 degrees = <<45-33=12>>12 degrees
Then find how much Carson needs to heat his house to avoid the pipes freezing: 32 degrees - 12 degrees = <<32-12=20>>20 degrees
Then divide the amount of heat Carson needs by the amount of heat each log produces: 20 degrees / 5 degrees/log = <<20/5=4>>4 logs

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of groups:**
   - There are 90 people.
   - Each group consists of 9 people.
   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{People per group}} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought back:**
   - According to the problem, if 3/5 of the groups each have members bring back 2 seashells each.
   - The number of groups that bring back seashells is \( \frac{3}{5} \times 10 \).
   \[
   \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]
   - Each of these groups brings back 2 seashells.
   \[
   \text{Total seashells brought back} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 12 seashells.<|im_end|>","Since the total number of people at the competition was 90, they formed 90/9=<<90/9=10>>10 groups after splitting into 9-person groups.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Jamie earned on Tuesday, we'll break down the problem into steps.

**Step 1: Calculate Jamie's regular pay for working 8 hours**

Jamie's regular hourly wage is $20. For 8 hours of work:

\[ \text{Regular Pay} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Number of Hours} \]

\[ \text{Regular Pay} = \$20 \times 8 \]
\[ \text{Regular Pay} = \$160 \]

**Step 2: Determine the extra hours worked**

Jamie worked an additional 3 hours (since \( 11 - 8 = 3 \) hours).

**Step 3: Calculate the overtime pay based on the extra hours**

Overtime pays at 150% of the regular rate. First, calculate 150% of the regular hourly wage:

\[ \text{Overtime Rate} = \text{Regular Hourly Wage} \times 1.5 \]

\[ \text{Overtime Rate} = \$20 \times 1.5 \]
\[ \text{Overtime Rate} = \$30 \]

Now, calculate the overtime pay for the 3 hours worked:

\[ \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Rate} \times \text{Extra Hours} \]

\[ \text{Overtime Pay} = \$30 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Overtime Pay} = \$90 \]

**Step 4: Add the regular pay and overtime pay together**

\[ \text{Total Pay} = \text{Regular Pay} + \text{Overtime Pay} \]

\[ \text{Total Pay} = \$160 + \$90 \]
\[ \text{Total Pay} = \$250 \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid **$250** for her work on Tuesday.<|im_end|>","The first 8 hours pay 20*8=<<20*8=160>>160.

To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 12 female lions.
   - The number of male lions is half the number of female lions.
   - There are also 14 lion cubs.

2. **Calculate the number of male lions:**
   Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{\text{Number of female lions}}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Sum up all the lions:**
   Now that we know the number of female, male, and cubs, we add them together to find the total number of lions:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of cubs}

   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14

4. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - Original price of the jeans = $40.00
   - Discount rate = 25%

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \$40.00 \times \frac{25}{100} = \$40.00 \times 0.25 = \$10.00
   \]

2. **Determine the sale price after applying the discount:**

   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00
   \]

3. **Subtract the sale price from the amount Mike paid:**

   Mike paid with a $50.00 bill.

   \[
   \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Sale Price}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Money Left Over} = \$50.00 - \$30.00 = \$20.00

1. **Calculate the total number of employees hired in three months:**
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.
   - Over three months, the number of employees hired is \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \).

2. **Determine the total number of employees after three months:**
   - Initially, there are 200 employees.
   - After hiring 60 more employees, the total number of employees becomes \( 200 + 60 = 260 \).

3. **Calculate the total monthly salary for all employees:**
   - Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
   - With 260 employees, the total monthly salary is \( 260 \times 4000 = 1040000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money paid over three months:**
   - Since the salaries are paid monthly, the total amount of money paid after three months is \( 3 \times 1040000 = 3120000 \) dollars.

**Final Answer:**

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $\boxed{3120000}$.<|im_end|>","If each month the company hire 20 new employees, the total number of employees in the company in the first month is 200 employees + 20 employees = <<200+20=220>>220 employees
If each employee is paid $4000 per month, the total amount of money paid by the employee to its workers in the first month is 220 employees * $4000/employee = $<<220*4000=880000>>880000
In the second month, 20 more workers are hired, bringing the total number of employees to 220 employees + 20 employees = 240 employees
The company pays a total of 240 employees * $4000/employee = $<<240*4000=960000>>960000 in wages for its employees in the second month.
When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

To determine how long the choir will be singing in total, we need to calculate the time spent on each song and then sum those times.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent singing ""Deck the Halls""
- Time for ""Deck the Halls"": 150 seconds
- Number of times ""Deck the Halls"" is sung: 2
- Total time for ""Deck the Halls"": \(150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds}\)

Step 2: Calculate the time spent singing ""Jingle Bells""
- Time for ""Jingle Bells"": 240 seconds
- Number of times ""Jingle Bells"" is sung: 1
- Total time for ""Jingle Bells"": \(240 \text{ seconds} \times 1 = 240 \text{ seconds}\)

Step 3: Sum the total time for both songs
- Total time for ""Deck the Halls"": 300 seconds
- Total time for ""Jingle Bells"": 240 seconds
- Combined total time: \(300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}\)

Therefore, the choir will be caroling for a total of **540 seconds**.<|im_end|>","First find the total time the choir spends singing ""Deck the Halls"": 2 * 150 seconds = <<2*150=300>>300 seconds

                    question:
                    When Billy was first hired, he was paid at a rate of $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he ; was given a raise ? of $0.50 per ! hour.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, how , much more money will Billy earn than Sally, , in dollars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more money Billy earns than Sally after their respective raises, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Billy's new hourly wage after the raise.
Billy's original hourly wage was $10.

- Raise amount = $0.50 per hour
- New hourly wage for Billy = Original wage + Raise amount
\[ \text{New hourly wage} = \$10 + \$0.50 = \$10.50 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Billy's earnings from 20 hours.
Billy works 20 hours at his new hourly wage of $10.50.

- Earnings for Billy = Hours worked × Hourly wage
\[ \text{Earnings for Billy} = 20 \times \$10.50 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for Billy} = \$210 \]

### Step 3: Determine Sally's starting salary based on Billy's starting salary.
Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.

- Billy's starting hourly wage = $10
- Sally's starting hourly wage = \( \$10 + \$0.50 \)
\[ \text{Sally's starting hourly wage} = \$10.50 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Sally's earnings from 20 hours.
Sally also works 20 hours at her hourly wage of $10.50.

- Earnings for Sally = Hours worked × Hourly wage
\[ \text{Earnings for Sally} = 20 \times \$10.50 \]
\[ \text{Earnings for Sally} = \$210 \]

### Step 5: Compare Billy's and Sally's earnings.
- Billy's total earnings = $210
- Sally's total earnings = $210

Since both Billy and Sally have the same total earnings over 20 hours, the difference in their earnings is zero.

### Conclusion:
Billy does not earn any more money than Sally because they have identical earnings after their respective raises.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]<|im_end|>","Billy has a salary of $10+0.50+$1.00=$<<10+0.5+1=11.50>>11.50 per hour.
Sally is paid $0.50 more per hour than Billy's initial salary, for a total of $10+$0.50=$<<10+0.5=10.50>>10.50 per hour.
If Billy works 20 hours, he will be paid 20*$11.50=$<<20*11.5=230>>230
If Sally works 20 hours, she will be paid 20*$10.50=$<<20*10.50=210>>210.
Thus, if both work 20 hours, Billy will be paid $230-$210=$20 more.

To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost compared to 2 bagels, we need to calculate the total cost for both items.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 3 loaves of bread.
- Each loaf of bread costs $2.
- Therefore, the cost for 3 loaves = \( 3 \times \$2 \).

\[
\text{Cost of 3 loaves} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 2 bagels.
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 bagels = \( 2 \times \$1 \).

\[
\text{Cost of 2 bagels} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in cost between the two quantities.
- The difference in cost = Cost of 3 loaves - Cost of 2 bagels.

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 6 \text{ dollars} - 2 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels.

\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate Nikita's score:**
   - Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson.
   - First, find half of Pierson's score:
     \[
     \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
     \]
   - Then add 11 to that amount:
     \[
     \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
     \]

2. **Add both scores together:**
   - Pierson's score: 278 points
   - Nikita's score: 150 points
   - Total score:
     \[
     \text{Total score} = 278 + 150 = 428

To determine the total number of trees planted by Ashley's school, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of children in the school:**
   - There are 40 classes.
   - Each class has an average of 25 students.

\[
\text{Total number of children} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
\]

2. **Calculate the total number of trees planted by the children:**
   - Each child plants one tree.

\[
\text{Number of trees planted by children} = 1000
\]

3. **Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers:**
   - There are 3 teachers per class.
   - There are 40 classes.

\[
\text{Number of teachers} = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.

\[
\text{Number of trees planted by teachers} = 120 \times 2 = 240
\]

4. **Add the number of trees planted by both children and teachers:**

\[

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of stuffed animals currently owned.
- Stuffed puppies: 3
- Stuffed koalas: 5
- Stuffed zebras: 2
- Stuffed frogs: 4

Total current stuffed animals = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14

### Step 2: Determine the total number of stuffed animals needed for the desired percentage.
Bubbles wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%.

Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy.

Given that the percentage of stuffed goats should be 30%, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{x + 14} = 0.30
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
First, simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{x + 14} = 0.30
\]

Multiply both sides by \( x + 14 \):

\[
x = 0.30(x + 14)
\]

Distribute 0.30 on the right side:

\[
x = 0.30x + 4.2
\]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[
0.70x = 4.2
\]

Divide both sides by 0.70:

\[
x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
\]

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy is **6**.<|im_end|>","Let x = the number of stuffed goats.
The current number of stuffed animals are (puppies + koalas + zebras + frogs) or 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = <<3+5+2+4=14>>14 stuffed animals total.
Take the total stuffed animals, add x and divide by the number of stuffed goats to get to 30% or x / (14 + x) = .3
Cross multiply to get x = 0.42 + .3x
Subtract .3 x from each side, .7x = 0.42
Bubbles needs x = <<6=6>>6 goats added.

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach her goal of 30 hours, we can break down the problem into two parts: calculating the total hours played in the first two weeks and then determining how much more she needs to play.

**Step 1: Calculate the total hours played in the first two weeks**

- **First Week**: Kris plays for half an hour (0.5 hours) every day.
  - Number of days in one week = 7
  - Total hours played in the first week = \( 0.5 \times 7 \)

\[
0.5 \times 7 = 3.5 \text{ hours}
\]

- **Second Week**: Kris plays for 2 hours every day.
  - Number of days in one week = 7
  - Total hours played in the second week = \( 2 \times 7 \)

\[
2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Sum the hours from both weeks**

- Total hours played over two weeks:

\[
3.5 + 14 = 17.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the hours already played from the total required hours**

- Hours still needed to play:

\[
30 - 17.5 = 12.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:** Kris still needs to play for **12.5 hours** to earn the video game achievement.<|im_end|>","Two weeks is the same as 2 weeks * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 days.

Playing for 2 hours every day for another week will be an additional 2 hours * 7 days = <<2*7=14>>14 hours.
She therefore still needs to play 30 – 7 – 14 = <<30-7-14=9>>9 hours.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between the two cars after they have traveled for 2 hours at their respective speeds.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the relative speed:**
   - Let \( v_1 \) be the speed of the first car (60 mph).
   - Let \( v_2 \) be the speed of the second car (70 mph).

   The relative speed (\( V_{rel} \)) is given by:
   \[
   V_{rel} = |v_2 - v_1| = |70 - 60| = 10 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance covered in one hour:**
   - Both cars travel at the relative speed for 1 hour.
   - Distance covered in one hour (\( D_1 \)):
     \[
     D_1 = V_{rel} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance covered in 2 hours:**
   - Since both cars cover the same relative distance in one hour, they will also cover the same distance in 2 hours.
   - Total distance covered in 2 hours (\( D_2 \)):
     \[
     D_2 = D_1 \times 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After 2 hours, the distance between the two cars will be 20 miles.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{20 miles}}

                    Janet is : collecting : the results of Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test. 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, along with 40 : out of 100 fourth graders. The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate. What is the school's overall pass rate?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To find the overall pass rate for Herbert Hoover Elementary School, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of passing students in each grade.
- Third-grade students: \(340\)
- Fourth-grade students: \(40\) (out of \(100\)), so the total number of students is \(100 \times 40 = 400\).
- Fifth-grade students: Twice the fourth-grade pass rate, so the pass rate for fifth-grade students is \(2 \times 40 = 80\%\) or \(80\) students.

### Step 2: Sum up the total number of passing students across all grades.
Total passing students:
\[ 340 + 40 + 80 = 460 \]

### Step 3: Determine the total number of students.
Total students:
\[ 340 + 400 + 100 = 840 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the overall pass rate.
Overall pass rate:
\[ \frac{460}{840} \approx 0.5592 \text{ or } 55.92\% \]

### Final Answer:
The school's overall pass rate is approximately **55.92%**.<|im_end|>","First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4
Then double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8
Then multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders
Now add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students
Add up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students
Finally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%

                    question:
                    Milo is making a mosaic with chips of glass. It takes twelve glass chips to make every square inch of the mosaic. A bag of glass chips holds 72 chips. Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. : If he has two bags of glass chips, how many inches long can he make his mosaic?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how long Milo can make his mosaic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glass chips needed for the mosaic:**
   - We know that it takes 12 glass chips per square inch.
   - The height of the mosaic is given as 3 inches.

   Therefore, the total number of chips required = \( 12 \text{ chips/inch} \times 3 \text{ inches} \).

   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ chips}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of bags needed to get at least 36 chips:**
   - Each bag contains 72 chips.

   Since Milo already has two bags, let's calculate if those meet or exceed the requirement:

   \[
   \text{Chips in two bags} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
   \]

   Since 144 chips is more than 36 chips, Milo will have enough chips even with just two bags.

3. **Calculate the length of the mosaic based on the available chips:**
   - Since one bag provides 72 chips, two bags provide 144 chips.

   Given that it takes 12 chips to cover one square inch, we divide the total number of chips (144) by 12 to find the area covered by the mosaic:

   \[
   \text{Area covered} = \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches}
   \]

Therefore, Milo can make a mosaic that covers an area of 12 square inches.

### Conclusion:
Milo can make his mosaic 3 inches tall because the area covered by the mosaic does not depend on its height but rather on the number of square inches covered. Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{3 \text{ inches}}<|im_end|>","Milo has two bags of glass chips, so he has 72 * 2 = <<72*2=144>>144 chips.
With those, he can make 144 / 12 = <<144/12=12>>12 square inches of mosaic.
Thus, Milo can make his 3 inch tall mosaic 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 inches long.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tea consumed.
- Each of the four students drank 1.5 quarts of tea.
- Therefore, the total amount of tea consumed by these four students is \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.

- Each of the sixteen students drank 2 quarts of tea.
- Therefore, the total amount of tea consumed by these sixteen students is \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

- The total amount of tea consumed by all students is \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.

### Step 2: Determine how much tea was initially available.
We know that there are 10 quarts of tea remaining after the consumption.

### Step 3: Set up an equation to find the initial amount of tea.
Let \(x\) be the number of quarts of tea at the beginning of the party.

Since we have already used some tea and still have some left, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:
\[ x - (38) = 10 \]

This equation represents the fact that the initial amount minus the amount consumed equals the remaining amount.

### Step 4: Solve for \(x\).
\[ x - 38 = 10 \]
\[ x = 10 + 38 \]
\[ x = 48 \]

So, the initial amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 48 quarts.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 48 quarts.<|im_end|>","4 students drank 1.5 quarts = 4 * 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6 quarts
16 students drank 2 quarts = 16 * 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 quarts
Students drank 6 + 32 quarts = <<6+32=38>>38 quarts
Students + tea left = 38 + 10 quarts = <<38+10=48>>48 quarts
48 quarts = 12 gallons

                    Dale is selling butterscotch , candies to raise money for his club at school. He doesn't have the candies yet and is instead just taking orders. He started off with 100 total that he ordered and wanted to sell, but he ended up selling 150 butterscotch candies. Then he ordered 100 more. How many does Dale still need to sell to sell all of his candy?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Order**: Dale starts with 100 butterscotch candies.
2. **First Sale**: Dale sells 150 butterscotch candies. Since he only had 100 initially, this sale exceeds his initial order amount. Therefore, we need to subtract the sold amount from the initial order: \(100 - 150 = -50\). This indicates a deficit because he already exceeded his initial order.

Since he has no more butterscotch left to sell after the first sale, we cannot proceed further without additional information or clarification on how to handle the remaining butterscotch. However, if we assume the problem intends to focus on the total sales rather than the initial order quantity, then the key is understanding that he can't continue selling any butterscotch as they've already been sold.

3. **Second Order**: Dale decides to place another order of 100 butterscotch candies.
4. **Final Calculation**: After placing the second order, Dale now needs to sell 100 butterscotch candies (since he has no butterscotch left).

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell \(\boxed{100}\) butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.<|im_end|>","Dale starts off selling 100 butterscotch candies that he ordered, but ends up selling 150, 100 - 150 = <<100-150=-50>>-50 candies.
So Dale orders 100 more candies to make up for the deficit and to sell even more, -50 candies + 100 candies = <<100-50=50>>50 candies Dale has left and still needs to sell.

                    In one year, the number of . students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If , there are 10 students on campus at the beginning . of the year, how many additional students would have joined by , the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at ; the beginning of the year?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the beginning of each month and then determine how many more students join between these dates.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month.
- At the beginning of the year (Month 1), there are 10 students.
- At the end of Month 2, the number of students doubles from the beginning of the year.
- At the end of Month 3, the number of students doubles again from the end of Month 2.
- At the end of Month 4, the number of students doubles again from the end of Month 3.
- At the end of Month 5, the number of students doubles again from the end of Month 4.

Let's denote the initial number of students as \( S_0 \) and the doubling factor per month as \( F \). Given that the initial number of students \( S_0 = 10 \).

Step 2: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month.
\[
S_{end} = S_0 \times F^n
\]
where \( n \) is the number of months since the beginning of the year.

Calculating for each month:

- End of Month 1 (\( n = 1 \)):
\[
S_{end}(1) = 10 \times 2^1 = 20
\]

- End of Month 2 (\( n = 2 \)):
\[
S_{end}(2) = 20 \times 2^2 = 80
\]

- End of Month 3 (\( n = 3 \)):
\[
S_{end}(3) = 80 \times 2^3 = 160
\]

- End of Month 4 (\( n = 4 \)):
\[
S_{end}(4) = 160 \times 2^4 = 320
\]

- End of Month 5 (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
S_{end}(5) = 320 \times 2^5 = 640
\]

Step 3: Determine the total number of new students joining between the beginning of the year and the end of May.
Since we are calculating up to the end of May, which includes both the end of April and the beginning of May, we need to consider the difference in the number of students at the end of March and the end of April.

We know that the number of students doubles every month. Therefore, the increase in the number of students between the end of April and the end of May is due to two doublings (from the end of April to the end of May).

Thus, the number of students at the end of May will be:
\[
S_{end}(5) = 640
\]

And the number of students at the end of April will be:
\[
S_{end}(4) = 320
\]

So, the number of new students joining between the beginning of the year and the end of May is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Number of new students} = S_{end}(5) - S_{end}(4)
\]
\[
= 640 - 320
\]
\[
= 320
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is 320 additional students.<|im_end|>","At the end of January, the number of students doubles to 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20
At the end of February, the number of students increases to 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40

By the end of April, the number of students is 2*80=<<2*80=160>>160
At the end of May, the number of students has doubled to 2*160=<<2*160=320>>320
If there were initially 10 students, 320-10=<<320-10=310>>310 students would join the campus by the end of May.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed on average over the course of a week given his earnings.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of days in a week**
There are 7 days in a week.

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount Felix earned in a week**
Felix made $105 in one week.

**Step 3: Determine the cost per branch**
Each branch costs him $0.25.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of branches climbed**
Since each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount earned by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total Number of Branches} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Cost Per Branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
\]

\[
\text{Total Number of Branches} = 420
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day**
There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week:

\[
\text{Average Number of Branches Per Day} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Branches}}{\text{Number of Days}}
\]

\[
\text{Average Number of Branches Per Day} = \frac{420}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Average Number of Branches Per Day} = 60

Therefore, Felix climbs on average **60 branches per day**.<|im_end|>","He climbed 420 branches in total because 105 / .25 = <<105/.25=420>>420

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers picked.
2. Determine how many flowers are left after some are dropped or blown away.
3. Calculate the total number of petals on the remaining flowers.

Let's break it down:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers picked
- Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- Finally, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Total number of petals from all flowers: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\).

### Step 2: Determine how many flowers are left after dropping or blowing away
Rose drops 1 flower from each group:
- From the first group (3 flowers): \(3 - 1 = 2\) flowers left.
- From the second group (4 flowers): \(4 - 1 = 3\) flowers left.
- From the third group (5 flowers): \(5 - 1 = 4\) flowers left.
- From the fourth group (6 flowers): \(6 - 1 = 5\) flowers left.

Total number of flowers left: \(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14\).

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of petals on the remaining flowers
Now, let's calculate the total number of petals on the remaining flowers:
- The first group has 2 flowers left, so they have \(2 \times 5 = 10\) petals.
- The second group has 3 flowers left, so they have \(3 \times 6 = 18\) petals.
- The third group has 4 flowers left, so they have \(4 \times 4 = 16\) petals.
- The fourth group has 5 flowers left, so they have \(5 \times 7 = 35\) petals.

Total number of petals from the remaining flowers: \(10 + 18 + 16 + 35 = 89\).

Therefore, the final answer is that there are **89** petals in total on the flowers in the vase.<|im_end|>","Rose picks 3*5=<<3*5=15>>15 petals worth of the 5 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 petals worth of the 6 petal flowers.
Rose then picks 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 petals worth of the 4 petal flowers.
Finally, Rose picks 6*7=<<6*7=42>>42 petals worth of the 7 petal flowers.
Rose carries 15+24+20+42=<<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals worth of flowers back to the vase.
But the wind blows 5+6+4+7=<<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals worth of flowers away.
So Rose has 101-22=<<101-22=79>>79 petals worth remaining

To determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marshmallows used:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores.
   - DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
   - Total marshmallows used = \(9 + 9 = 18\).

2. **Determine the number of marshmallows left after making S'mores:**
   - Initial number of marshmallows = 35.
   - Marshmallows used = 18.
   - Marshmallows left = \(35 - 18 = 17\).

3. **Account for the marshmallows dropped on the ground:**
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.
   - Marshmallows left = \(17 - 3 = 14\).

Now that we know there are 14 marshmallows left, we can calculate how many S'mores each kid can have.

4. **Divide the remaining marshmallows equally between John and DeSean:**
   - Number of kids = 2.
   - Marshmallows per kid = \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\).

Therefore, each kid can have **7 S'mores** with the remaining marshmallows left in the bag.<|im_end|>","They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money is spent on games based on the time played and the cost per game. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Determine the total playing time in minutes.
Jack and his three friends play together for a total of 4 hours. Since there are four people (including Jack), they split the total playing time equally among themselves.

\[ \text{Total playing time} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are four players, each person plays:

\[ \text{Time per player} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

However, since two of the friends are ""significantly worse"" at their respective games, they can only play half as long as Jack does. The friend who is ""significantly better"" can play 1.5 times longer.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of games each player can play.
- **Jack**: Can play 60 minutes, so he can play \( \frac{60}{1/4} = 240 \) games.
- **Friend 1**: Can play \( \frac{60}{1/2} = 120 \) games.
- **Friend 2**: Can play \( \frac{60}{1/4} = 240 \) games.
- **Friend 3**: Can play \( \frac{60}{1.5} = 40 \) games.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of games that use quarters.
- **Jack**: 240 games.
- **Friend 1**: 120 games.
- **Friend 2**: 240 games.
- **Friend 3**: 40 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, the total amount of money spent will be equal to the number of games played multiplied by 1 quarter/game.

### Step 4: Sum up the total money spent.
\[ \text{Total money spent} = (240 + 120 + 240 + 40) \times 1 \text{ quarter/game} \]
\[ \text{Total money spent} = 640 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 640 quarters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 640 quarters}}

                    question:
                    Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, ! fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of ; citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She ; uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much , salt as zest. How many ounces of oil does she use?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total volume of the jar**: 10 ounces.
2. **Ingredients used**:
   - Salt (S)
   - Oil (O)
   - Fragrance (F)
   - Citrus Zest (Z)
   - Sugar (U)

3. **Relationships between ingredients**:
   - The total volume of the jar = S + O + F + Z + U = 10 ounces.
   - She uses the same amount of citr ix zest (Z) as fragrant (F).
   - She uses the same amount of salt (S) as sugar (U).

4. **Specific amounts based on relationships**:
   - Since she uses twice as much oil as salt (O = 2S), then O = 2S.
   - Since she uses twice as much salt as zest (S = 2Z), then S = 2Z.

Now let’s substitute these relationships into the equation for the total volume of the jar:

\[ S + O + F + Z + U = 10 \]

We can express \( O \) and \( F \) in terms of \( S \):

- From \( S = 2Z \), we get \( Z = \frac{S}{2} \).
- From \( O = 2S \), we get \( F = 2Z = 2\left(\frac{S}{2}\right) = S \).

Substitute back into the total volume equation:

\[ S + 2S + S + \frac{S}{2} + U = 10 \]
\[ 6S + \frac{S}{2} + U = 10 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 7S + \frac{S}{2} + U = 10 \]
\[ \frac{14S + S}{2} + U = 10 \]
\[ \frac{15S}{2} + U = 10 \]
\[ \frac{15S}{2} + U = 10 \]

From here, isolate \( U \):

\[ U = 10 - \frac{15S}{2} \]

Since \( S \) represents the same quantity as \( Z \), and \( Z \) equals \( F \), we know that the quantities must sum up correctly given their proportional relationships. Therefore:

\[ U = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the number of ounces of oil she uses is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]<|im_end|>","Let Z be the ounces of zest Tanya uses.
Tanya uses the same amount of fragrance as zest, so she uses Z + Z = 2Z fragrance and zest.
She uses twice as much salt as zest, so she uses 2Z salt.
She uses the same amount of sugar as salt, so she uses 2Z + 2Z + 2Z = <<2+2+2=6>>6Z fragrance, zest, salt, and sugar.
She uses twice as much oil as salt, so she uses 2 * 2Z = <<2*2=4>>4Z oil.
In all, she uses 6Z + 4Z = 10Z = <<6+4=10>>10 ounces of fragrance, zest, salt, sugar, and oil.
Thus, she uses Z = 10 / 10 = <<10/10=1>>1 ounce of zest.
Thus, Tanya uses 4Z = <<4=4>>4 ounces of oil.

To determine how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows separately, then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the goats
John buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $500.
\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = \text{Number of goats} \times \text{Cost per goat}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = \$1500

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cows
John buys 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500.
\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = \text{Number of cows} \times \text{Cost per cow}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = \$3000
\]

### Step 3: Sum the costs
Now, add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find out how much money John spent in total.
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of goats} + \text{Total cost of cows}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = \$4500
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Joe's initial number of cars:**
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - The total number of cars Joe has is 40.
   - So, he sells \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold.
   - He sold 8 cars.
   - Therefore, he gives \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars to his mother.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe originally had 40 cars.
   - He sold 8 cars.
   - He gave away 16 cars to his mother.
   - Thus, the remaining number of cars is \(40 - 8 - 16\).

Let's perform the arithmetic for the remaining number of cars:
\[ 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 \]

So, Joe remains with **16** cars after selling and giving some to his mother.<|im_end|>","If Robert has 20 cars, and Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, Joe has 2*20 = 40 cars.
He then sells 20/100*40=<<20/100*40=8>>8 cars from his car collection.
After selling 8 cars, Joe remains with 40-8=<<40-8=32>>32 cars.
Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, a total of 2*8=<<2*8=16>>16 cars.
The number of cars that Joe has remaining after giving 16 cars to his mother is 32-16=<<32-16=16>>16

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount raised by the students.
Given that the total amount raised is $175,000 and $50,000 came from outside sources, we can subtract this amount from the total to find out how much was raised by the students.

\[
\text{Amount raised by students} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Amount from external sources}
\]
\[
\text{Amount raised by students} = \$175,000 - \$50,000 = \$125,000
\]

### Step 2: Divide the total amount raised by students among the students.
Since there are 20 students and they all earn an equal amount, we divide the total amount raised by students by the number of students.

\[
\text{Amount per student} = \frac{\text{Total amount raised by students}}{\text{Number of students}}
\]
\[
\text{Amount per student} = \frac{\$125,000}{20}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the division.
Now, let's do the calculation.

\[
\text{Amount per student} = \frac{\$125,000}{20} = \$6,250

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how long Sandy walked on the second day.
2. Calculate the total time Sandy walked over both days.
3. Convert the total time from hours to minutes.

**Step 1: Determine how long Sandy walked on the second day**

Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she did on the first day. Since she walked for 8 hours on the first day, we calculate her walking time on the second day as follows:
\[ \text{Time on the second day} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time Sandy walked over both days**

Now that we know she walked for 8 hours on the first day and 4 hours on the second day, we can find the total time she spent walking by adding these two amounts together:
\[ \text{Total time} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Convert the total time from hours to minutes**

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 12 hours into minutes by multiplying by 60:
\[ 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:

2. **After First Break:**
   During the first break, he counted an additional 20 cars.
   
   Calculation:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. **After Lunch Break:**
   After lunch, it was discovered that half of the cars from before (including those added) had left the parking lot.
   
   To find out how many cars were there after lunch, we need to calculate half of the total cars at that point.
   
   Since the total count before lunch includes both initial cars and those added, we can consider the remaining half of that total as follows:

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much John makes from his work over a full 7-day week, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of tasks per cycle.
John performs 30 cycles in one day. Since each cycle contains 5 different tasks, we can calculate the total number of tasks for one day as follows:
\[ \text{Number of tasks per cycle} = 5 \]
\[ \text{Total number of tasks in one day} = 30 \times 5 = 150 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for one day.
Each task pays $1.20, so the earnings for one day can be calculated by multiplying the number of tasks by the payment per task:
\[ \text{Earnings per day} = 150 \times \$1.20 \]
\[ \text{Earnings per day} = \$180 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for a full 7-day week.
Since John works 7 days in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7:
\[ \text{Total earnings for a week} = \$180 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Total earnings for a week} = \$1260 \]

- Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.
- Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game.

\[
\text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10

So, Julie scored **10** points in the first game.

### Step 2: Determine Sasha's Score in the Second Game
- Sasha struggled more in away games but still scored 6 fewer points than Julie in the second game.

\[

\text{Total cans in cat food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]
\[
= 8 \times 11
\]
\[
= 88
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cans in the dog food packages.
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package contains 6 tins.

\[
\text{Total cans in dog food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]
\[
= 6 \times 6
\]
\[
= 36
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total number of cans in the dog food from the total number of cans in the cat food.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cans in cat food} - \text{Total cans in dog food}
\]
\[
= 88 - 36
\]
\[
= 52
\]

Therefore, Kimberly bought **52** more tins of cat food than dog food. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{52}
\]<|im_end|>","The number of cat food tins that Kimberley has bought is 8 × 11 = <<8*11=88>>88.

                    question:
                    Becca, Smendrick, and PJ have collections of Magic ; Cards.  ! There is a total of ? 341 cards.  Becca has 12 , more than Smendrick, and Smendrick has : 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.  How many cards does Becca have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( P \) represent the number of Magic Card (MC) cards PJ has.
Since Smendrick has 3 times as many MCs as PJ, Smendrick will have \( 3P \).
Becca has 12 more MCs than Smendrick.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We know there is a total of 341 MCs in all three collections combined. Therefore,
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate terms involving \( P \):
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7 to find \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{329}{7} \]
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 MCs.

### Step 3: Calculate Smendrick's MCs
Smendrick has 3 times as many MCs as PJ:
\[ Smendrick = 3P \]
\[ Smendrick = 3 \times 47 \]
\[ Smendrick = 141 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Becca's MCs
Becca has 12 more MCs than Smendrick:
\[ Becca = Smendrick + 12 \]
\[ Becca = 141 + 12 \]
\[ Becca = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has **153** Magic Card (MC) cards.<|im_end|>","Let x represent the number of cards PJ has
Smendrick:3x

x=<<47=47>>47 cards

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of blue eggs:**
   - Cindy has 5 green eggs.
   - The number of blue eggs is twice as many as green eggs.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue eggs} = 2 \times \text{Number of green eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pink eggs:**
   - Cindy has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs.
   \[
   \text{Number of pink eggs} = \text{Number of blue eggs} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
   \]

3. **Determine the number of yellow eggs:**
   - Cindy has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow eggs} = \frac{\text{Number of pink eggs}}{3} = \frac{9}{3} = 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs:**
   - Add the number of eggs of all colors together.
   \[
   \text{Total number of eggs} = \text{Green eggs} + \text{Blue eggs} + \text{Pink eggs} + \text{Yellow eggs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of eggs} = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]<|im_end|>","She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 blue eggs.
She has one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she has 10 - 1 = <<10-1=9>>9 pink eggs.
And finally, she has a third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has 9 / 3 = <<9/3=3>>3 yellow eggs.
Added all together, she has 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow = <<5+10+9+3=27>>27 eggs.

<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total cost of shipping the book, then apply the refund rate from Amazon. Let's break this down step-by-step.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The weight of the book is 4 pounds.
   - The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.
   - Therefore, the shipping cost for the book = \(4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35/\text{pound} = \$1.40\).

2. **Add the base cost of the book to the shipping cost:**
   - The book itself costs $32.
   - So, the total cost before any discount or refund is \(\$1.40 + \$32 = \$33.40\).

3. **Apply the refund rate from Amazon:**
   - Amazon refunds 75% of the purchase price.
   - So, the amount refunded = \(0.75 \times \$32 = \$24\).
   - Therefore, the net cost after applying the refund is \(\$33.40 - \$24 = \$9.40\).

4. **Determine the loss:**
   - Milly paid $33.40 in total but gets back $24.
   - Her loss = Total payment - Refund = \$33.40 - \$24 = \$9.40.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: $\boxed{\$9.40}$<|im_end|>","Milly will get back from Amazon $32 * .75 = $<<32*.75=24>>24 once the book is returned.
She will lose $32 - 24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 when the book is returned.
The first part of the shipping cost is $0.35 per pound * 4 pounds = $<<0.35*4=1.40>>1.40
The second part of the shipping cost is $0.08 per mile * 20 miles = $<<0.08*20=1.60>>1.60

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total amount of money Mulan initially has:**
   - Mulan starts with $40.
   - Her father gives her $100.
   - Total initial amount = $40 + $100 = $140.

2. **Calculate the cost of the items she bought:**
   - She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.
     Cost of one pair of jeans = $30
     Cost of two pairs of jeans = 2 × $30 = $60.
   - She also buys a bag for $20.
   - Total cost of all items = Cost of jeans + Cost of bag = $60 + $20 = $80.

3. **Subtract the total cost from the total initial amount:**
   - Money spent on items = $80.
   - Money remaining after purchases = Initial amount - Total cost = $140 - $80 = $60.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is $60.<|im_end|>","Mulan has a total of $40 + $100 = $<<40+100=140>>140.

To determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the production for the first week:**
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Determine the production for the second week:**
   - According to the problem, the second week's production is half of the first week.
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to break down her activities into manageable parts and then calculate the total time spent.

Step 1: Calculate the number of TikTok videos she makes in a week.
Britany makes 18 videos per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total time she spends on TikTok making videos in a week.
Each video takes 4 minutes to make, so:
\[ 18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Step 3: Add the time she spends on other activities.
She spends 2 hours (which is 120 minutes) writing songs and 15 minutes every day on makeup.

First, let's convert the daily makeup time from minutes to hours:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 0.25 \text{ hours/day} \]
So, she spends \( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ minutes/week} \).

Now, add all these times together to get the total weekly time spent on TikTok:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok in a month with four weeks.
\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 720 \text{ minutes/month} \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks is **720 minutes**.<|im_end|>","First find how long Britany spends recording the videos: 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = <<18*4=72>>72 minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much Angela's project will cost, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial cost and the additional cost based on the number of items installed.

### Step 1: Calculate the base cost for the initial items
- **Mirrors**: The firm installs 4 mirrors initially.
- **Chandeliers**: The firm installs 2 chandeliers initially.
- **Pictures**: The firm installs 10 pictures initially.

Base cost calculation:
\[
\text{Base cost} = \$129.00 + (4 \times \$12.00) + (2 \times \$12.00) + (10 \times \$12.00)
\]
\[
= \$129.00 + \$48.00 + \$24.00 + \$120.00
\]
\[
= \$331.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for the remaining items
Angela wants to add more items, but there is no information provided about these items. Therefore, we assume that the total number of items installed does not exceed the maximum capacity allowed by the firm.

Since Angela has already installed 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures, let’s check if it exceeds the firm’s limits:

Total items installed:
\[
6 \text{ mirrors} + 2 \text{ chandeliers} + 20 \text{ pictures}
\]
This combination totals 28 items, which exceeds the firm’s limit of 30 items (since they can only handle up to 10 items).

### Conclusion
Given that the firm allows up to 10 items at a time, and Angela has already reached or exceeded their capacity, the firm would not be able to process any further requests under normal conditions.

Therefore, the firm cannot provide additional services beyond what was included in their standard offer.

Final Answer: Since the firm's standard offer does not allow for any additional items beyond those specified, the total cost remains the same as the initial cost calculated.

1. **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch**.
   - So, if Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Naruto can lift a mountain \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \) inches (since Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Pompei).

2. **Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Pompei**.
   - Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) inches.

3. **Naruto can lift a mountain 10 inches**.
   - This confirms our previous calculation since Naruto can lift a mountain 10 inches, which matches the statement that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.

Now, let's convert Naruto's ability into feet:

- Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we need to convert Naruto’s height from inches to feet.
- To do this, divide the number of inches by 12: \( \frac{10}{12} \approx 0.8333 \) feet.

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain approximately 0.8333 feet high.

### The final answer is: \(\boxed{0.8333}\)<|im_end|>","If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, and Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, then Saskay can lift a mountain 12*1=12 inches=1 foot.
Since Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, then Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4*1=<<4*1=4>>4 feet.
And since Naruto can lift a mountain ten times higher than Kagiyami. then Naruto can lift a mountain 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 feet.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance Mason travels during his biking journey.

1. **Calculate the distance covered in the first part of the trip:**
   - Speed = 8 miles/hour
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \)
   - Distance = 32 miles

2. **Calculate the distance covered in the second part of the trip:**
   - Speed = 8 miles/hour
   - Time = 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = \( 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} \)
   - Distance = 48 miles

3. **Add the distances from both parts of the trip:**
   - Total Distance = Distance from the first part + Distance from the second part
   - Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles
   - Total Distance = 80 miles

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is 80 miles.<|im_end|>","If Mason travels for 8 miles in one hour, in four hours, he traveled for 8*4 = <<8*4=32>>32 miles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Understand the given information**

- It takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway.
- Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo.

**Step 2: Determine the time taken by one kangaroo**

Since 3 kangaroos can cover the distance in 18 hours, we need to find out how long it would take for just one kangaroo to do that journey.

Let \( T_k \) be the time taken by one kangaroo.

\[ 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times T_k = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Solving for \( T_k \):

\[ T_k = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, one kangaroo takes 6 hours to travel across the highway.

**Step 3: Calculate the time taken by one turtle**

Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, if one kangaroo covers the distance in 6 hours, then one turtle will take twice as long to cover the same distance because its speed is halved.

Thus, the time taken by one turtle \( T_t \) is:

\[ T_t = 2 \times T_k \]
\[ T_t = 2 \times 6 \text{ hours} \]
\[ T_t = 12 \text{ hours} \]

So, one turtle also takes 12 hours to travel across the highway.

**Step 4: Find the combined time for four turtles**

If one turtle takes 12 hours to travel across the highway, then four turtles together will take less time.

Since each turtle takes 12 hours, the total time taken by four turtles (assuming they work simultaneously) would be simply:

\[ 4 \text{ turtles} \times T_t = 4 \times 12 \text{ hours} \]
\[ 4 \times 12 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, when working together, four turtles will complete the journey in **48 hours**.

**Final Answer**
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48 \text{ hours}}

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of clay dishes each person makes and then sum them up.

1. **Determine how many clay dishes Rory makes:**
   - We know that Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
   - Given that Kora made 20 dishes, Rory must have made \(20 + 20 = 40\) dishes.

2. **Determine how many clay dishes Jada makes:**
   - Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
   - Since Rory made 40 dishes, Jada must have made \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dishes.

3. **Sum the total number of clay dishes made by all three:**
   - Kora made 20 dishes.
   - Rory made 40 dishes.
   - Jada made 80 dishes.

2. Add the $150 she earned from her part-time job.
3. Add the $80 her mother gave her.
4. Subtract the remaining $50 needed to buy the laptop.

Let's go through each step:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount from trading in her old laptop.
- The original cost of the laptop is $600.
- Trading in her old laptop reduces the price by $200.
\[ \text{Total after trade} = \$600 - \$200 = \$400 \]

Step 2: Add the $150 she earned from her part-time job.
\[ \text{Total after earnings} = \$400 + \$150 = \$550 \]

Step 3: Add the $80 her mother gave her.
\[ \text{Total after receiving money from mom} = \$550 + \$80 = \$630 \]

Step 4: Subtract the remaining $50 needed to buy the laptop.
\[ \text{Money left after buying laptop} = \$630 - \$50 = \$580 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has in her purse is \( \$580 \).

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of milk produced per day:**
   - The farmer currently produces 5 liters of milk per day.

2. **Calculate the number of additional days' worth of milk needed:**
   - We want to know how many cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk per day.
   - If one cow can produce 5 liters per day, then we divide the desired daily production (25 liters) by the current daily production rate (5 liters per cow).
     \[
     \text{Number of cows needed} = \frac{\text{Desired daily production}}{\text{Current daily production per cow}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total milk volume required for the additional cows:**
   - With 5 cows producing 5 liters of milk per day, they will collectively produce \(5 \times 5 = 25\) liters of milk per day.
   
4. **Check if the farmer already has enough cows to meet the new requirement:**
   - Currently, the farmer has 3 cows.
   - To see if these 3 cows can produce 25 liters of milk per day, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Milk production per day with 3 cows} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - This shows that 3 cows cannot produce 25 liters of milk per day because they only produce 15 liters.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer needs at least 5 cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day, but since he only has 3 cows, he needs to acquire 2 more cows.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: 2 more cows are needed.<|im_end|>","He extracts 5*3=<<5*3=15>>15 liters of milk in a day.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the remaining lengths of the glue sticks after they have been partially used. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the length of each unused part of the glue sticks.
- **First glue stick**: It has \( \frac{1}{6} \) left.
- **Second glue stick**: It has \( \frac{2}{3} \) left.
- **Third glue stick**: It has \( \frac{1}{2} \) left.

### Step 2: Calculate the length of the unused part for each glue stick.
- **First glue stick**:
  - Original length = 12 mm
  - Remaining length = \( 12 \times (1 - \frac{1}{6}) \)
  - Simplify inside the parentheses: 
    \[
    1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}

- **Third glue stick**:
  - Original length = 12 mm
  - Remaining length = \( 12 \times (1 - \frac{1}{2}) \)
  - Simplify inside the parentheses:
    \[
    1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
    \]
  - Multiply:
    \[
    12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ mm}
    \]

### Step 3: Sum up the lengths of all unused parts.
- First glue stick: 10 mm
- Second glue stick: 4 mm
- Third glue stick: 6 mm

Total length of unused parts:
\[
10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ mm}

                    Peter has twice as many socks as Jack and half times as many dishes as jack. Jack collected twice as many , dishes as socks in the ; store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many dishes Jack collects:**
   - According to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks.
   - We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes.

2. **Calculate the number of socks Jack collects:**
   - Since Jack collects twice as many dishes as socks,
     \[
     \text{Number of socks} = \frac{\text{Number of dishes}}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of dishes (60):
     \[
     \text{Number of socks} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

3. **Find out how many socks Peter has:**
   - Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.
   - Since Jack has 30 socks:
     \[
     \text{Number of socks Peter has} = 2 \times (\text{Number of socks Jack}) = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of socks and dishes:**
   - Add the number of socks Peter has to the number of dishes Jack has:
     \[
     \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = (\text{Number of socks Peter has}) + (\text{Number of dishes Jack has})
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total number of socks and dishes} = 60 + 60 = 120
     \]

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is {120}.<|im_end|>","Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60/2 = <<60/2=30>>30 socks.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 20

2. **Students who are good at math only**:
   - These students are not mentioned to have any other skill.
   - Therefore, these students contribute directly to the total count.

3. **Number of students who are good at math only**: 5

4. **Students who perform well in English only**:
   - These students also do not mention having any other skill.
   - Therefore, these students contribute directly to the total count.

5. **Number of students who perform well in English only**: 8

6. **Calculate the number of students who are good at both subjects (math and English)**:
   - Total students = Students good at math only + Students performing well in English only + Students good at both
   - Let \( x \) be the number of students good at both subjects.
   - We can set up the equation:

                    question:
                    Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school. The show will be 2 hours. She is allowing each group 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage. If she allows ? a 10-minute intermission, how many groups can perform in the concert?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to consider the total time required for one performance cycle (including setup, performance, and break) and compare it to the total duration of the concert.

**Step 1: Calculate the total time for one performance cycle**

- Time taken for setup = 2 minutes
- Time taken for performance = 6 minutes
- Time taken for break = 2 minutes
- Total time for one performance cycle = Setup + Performance + Break
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of performance cycles that fit into the concert duration**

- Concert duration = 2 hours = \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) minutes.
- Number of performance cycles per hour = \( \frac{\text{Concert duration}}{\text{Time per cycle}} = \frac{120}{10} = 12 \)

Since Vicki allows a 10-minute intermission after the last performance cycle, we subtract this from the total concert duration to find out when the intermission ends:

- Time left for intermission = 10 minutes
- Time remaining until next performance = 2 hours - 10 minutes = 58 minutes (since the first performance starts immediately).

**Step 3: Calculate the total time for one performance cycle including the intermission**

- Time taken for setup = 2 minutes
- Time taken for performance = 6 minutes
- Time taken for break = 2 minutes
- Time taken for intermission = 10 minutes
- Total time for one performance cycle including intermission = Setup + Performance + Break + Intermission
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Determine the number of performance cycles that fit into the concert duration including the intermission**

- Concert duration including intermission = 2 hours = 120 minutes.
- Number of performance cycles per hour = \( \frac{\text{Concert duration including intermission}}{\text{Time per cycle}} = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \)

Therefore, the number of performance cycles that can fit into the concert is 6.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is {The concert can accommodate 6 performances}.<|im_end|>","First, we should convert the 2 hours of showtime into minutes for our calculations. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, the show will be 2 x 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.

Each group will use 2 minutes to get on stage + 6 minutes to perform + 2 minutes to exit the stage = <<2+6+2=10>>10 minutes of show time.
Of the 110 minutes of performances, 10 are used per group, so 110 minutes / 10 = <<110/10=11>>11 groups can perform.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the annual interest rate:**
   - The interest rate is given as three-quarters of the original investment.
   - Let \( P \) be the principal amount ($300).
   - The interest rate \( r \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     r = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{original amount}
     \]
   - Substituting the original amount ($300):
     \[
     r = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the total interest earned over 3 years:**
   - The formula for simple interest is:
     \[
     I = P \times r \times t
     \]
   - Here, \( P = 300 \), \( r = 225\% \), and \( t = 3 \) years.
   - First, convert the interest rate from percentage to decimal form (since interest rates are typically expressed as decimals in financial calculations):
     \[
     r_{\text{decimal}} = \frac{225}{100} = 2.25
     \]
   - Now, calculate the total interest earned:
     \[
     I = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3
     \]
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     I = 300 \times 7.5 = 2250
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount after 3 years:**
   - The total amount \( A \) after 3 years is the sum of the principal and the interest earned:
     \[
     A = P + I
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     A = 300 + 2250 = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

After performing all the necessary calculations, Brenda will have a total of $\boxed{2550}$ dollars after 3 years.<|im_end|>","Three-quarters of $300 is (3/4)*$300 = $<<(3/4)*300=225>>225

- Therefore, the number of white shirts without collars = 40 - 20 = 20

Step 2: Determine the number of floral shirts that do not have buttons.
- Total number of floral shirts = 50
- Number of floral shirts with buttons = 20
- Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

1. **Determine how many trays are needed:**
   - The total number of eggs is 900.
   - Each tray can hold 30 eggs.

   To find out how many trays are required, divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of one tray:
   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Capacity of one tray}}

2. **Calculate the total earnings from selling the eggs:**
   - The price per tray is $2.5.
   - There are 30 trays in total.

   To find the total earnings, multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray}

   - Farm X initially has 55 goats.
   - Farm Y initially has 45 goats.

2. **Calculate how many goats were sold from each farm:**
   - From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold 10 goats.
   - From Farm Y, he sold twice as many goats as from Farm X, which means he sold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

3. **Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats on each farm:**
   - For Farm X after selling some goats: \(55 - 10\)
   - For Farm Y after selling some goats: \(45 - 20\)

4. **Add the remaining number of goats on both farms together:**

To determine how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes bought in a year:**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.

\[
\text{Total pairs of shoes} = \text{Number of pairs per month} \times \text{Number of months}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one basket of green food.
- The cost of one basket of green food is given as $25.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of one basket of red food.
- The cost of one basket of red food is given as $18.

### Step 3: Determine the cost of three baskets of green food.
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Number of baskets of green food = 3
- Total cost for three baskets of green food = \( 25 \times 3 \)

\[
25 \times 3 = 75
\]

So, the total cost for three baskets of green food is $75.

### Step 4: Determine the total number of baskets of red food purchased.
- Let’s assume there are 'n' baskets of red food.

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of the red food before any discount.
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18
- Number of baskets of red food = n

\[
Total cost of red food = 18 \times n
\]

### Step 6: Apply the discount on the red food.
- For each basket of red food, there is a $2 discount.
- Therefore, the total discount on all baskets of red food = \( 2 \times n \).

### Step 7: Calculate the total amount after applying the discount.
- Total cost of red food before discount = \( 18 \times n \)
- Discount on red food = \( 2 \times n \)

\[
Discounted cost of red food = (18 \times n) - (2 \times n)
\]

\[
Discounted cost of red food = 16 \times n
\]

### Step 8: Add the discounted cost of red food to the total cost of green food.
- Total cost for three baskets of green food = $75
- Total cost for 'n' baskets of red food after discount = \( 16 \times n \)

\[
Total cost = 75 + 16 \times n
\]

### Step 9: Combine the results to find the final total cost.
- We need to know the value of 'n' (number of baskets of red food), but since no specific number was provided, we can't calculate an exact figure without that information.

However, if we assume the simplest case where only one basket of red food is bought (n=1):

- Cost for three baskets of green food = $75
- Cost for one basket of red food at full price = $18
- Discount on one basket of red food = $2

\[
Total cost = 75 + (18 - 2) = 75 + 16 = 91
\]

Therefore, the final answer would be:

{The final answer is} $91.<|im_end|>","The 3 baskets of green food will cost $25 x 3 = $<<25*3=75>>75.

So, the 3 baskets of red food will now cost $54 - $6 = $<<54-6=48>>48.
You will have to pay $75 + $48 = $<<75+48=123>>123 for all the baskets of food.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of rooms:**
   - There are 90 rooms in total.

2. **Calculate how many rooms need cleaning (half of the total):**
   - Half of 90 rooms is \( \frac{90}{2} = 45 \) rooms.

3. **Determine the time required to clean one room:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.

4. **Convert the time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 20 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
     \[
     \text{Time per room in hours} = \frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time for cleaning half of the rooms:**
   - Multiply the time per room by the number of rooms that need cleaning.
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 45 \times \frac{1}{3} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","90 * 20 = <<90*20=1800>>1800 minutes

                    question:
                    A local town is expanding and wants ; to build several new homes across the next three years. In the first year, they will build 12 homes. ! In the next year, they will build : three times this many homes. In the third year, they will count how many homes they have built and double the amount. How many homes will the town have built over the next three years?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of homes built in each year and then sum them up.

### Year 1:
- The town builds 12 homes.

### Year 2:
- In the second year, they build three times as many homes as in the first year.
- Calculation: \(3 \times 12 = 36\)

### Year 3:
- At the end of the third year, they double the total number of homes from the previous year.
- Calculation: \(2 \times (12 + 36) = 2 \times 48 = 96\)

Now, let's sum up all the homes built over the three years:

### Total Homes Built Over Three Years:
\[ 12 (\text{Year 1}) + 36 (\text{Year 2}) + 96 (\text{Year 3}) \]

\[ = 12 + 36 + 96 \]
\[ = 144 \]

Therefore, the town will have built **144 homes** over the next three years.<|im_end|>","In the second year, they build three times as many homes as the first year which is 12 * 3 = <<12*3=36>>36 homes.
So far in the two years, they've built 36+12 = <<36+12=48>>48 homes
In the third year, they double the number of homes built in the first two years, so 48*2 = <<48*2=96>>96 homes.
Altogether, the local town has built 48+ 96 = <<48+96=144>>144 homes.

<|im_start|>user

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    I am , three years younger than my brother, ; and I am 2 years older than my sister. My mom's age is one less than ! three times my brother's age. When you add all our ages, you get 87. How old am I?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's denote the ages as follows:
- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( y \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( z \) be my sister's age.

From the problem statement, we can derive the following equations:

1. ""I am three years younger than my brother"":
\[ x = y - 3 \]

2. ""I am two years older than my sister"":
\[ x = z + 2 \]

3. ""My mother's age is one less than three times my brother's age"":
\[ m = 3y - 1 \]
where \( m \) represents my mother's age.

4. The sum of our ages is 87:
\[ x + y + z + m = 87 \]

Now let's solve these equations step by step:

### Step 1: Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \)
Using equation (1):
\[ y = x + 3 \]

Substitute \( y \) into equation (2):
\[ x = (x + 3) + 2 \]
Simplify:
\[ x = x + 5 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = x \]
which doesn't provide new information but confirms consistency.

### Step 2: Substitute \( y \) from equation (1) into equation (2)
Using \( y = x + 3 \), substitute it back into equation (2):
\[ x = (x + 3) + 2 \]
Simplify:
\[ x = x + 5 \]

Again, this reaffirms consistency.

### Step 3: Substitute \( y \) and \( x \) into equation (3)
We know \( y = x + 3 \). Using \( y \) in equation (3):
\[ m = 3(x + 3) - 1 \]
Simplify:
\[ m = 3x + 9 - 1 \]
\[ m = 3x + 8 \]

### Step 4: Substitute \( y \) and \( x \) into equation (4)
Substituting \( y = x + 3 \) and \( x \) into equation (4):
\[ x + (x + 3) + z + (3x + 8) = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ x + x + 3 + z + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 5x + z + 11 = 87 \]
Subtract 11 from both sides:
\[ 5x + z = 76 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( z \)
We need to find \( z \). From equation (1):
\[ x = y - 3 \]
Substitute \( y = x + 3 \):
\[ x = (x + 3) - 3 \]
Simplify:
\[ x = x \]
Thus, no further simplification on \( x \).

### Step 6: Solve for \( z \) using \( 5x + z = 76 \)
Since we don't have enough information about \( x \) yet, let's express \( z \) directly:
\[ z = 76 - 5x \]

### Step 7: Determine \( x \) using \( 5x + z = 76 \)
We know that:
\[ x + (x + 3) + z + (3x + 8) = 87 \]
Substitute \( z \):
\[ x + x + 3 + (76 - 5x) + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
Simplify:
\[ 2x + 3 + 76 - 5x + 3x + 8 = 87 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 2x + 3 + 76 + 8 = 87 \]
\[ 2x + 87 = 87 \]
Subtract 87 from both sides:
\[ 2x = 0 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x = 0 \]

### Conclusion
There seems to be an inconsistency because \( x \) cannot be zero since ages must be positive integers. Rechecking calculations shows that \( x \) should indeed satisfy \( 5x + z = 76 \). Given \( x = 12 \):

Then:
\[ y = x + 3 = 15 \]
\[ z = 76 - 5(12) = 76 - 60 = 16 \]
And:
\[ m = 3(15) - 1 = 45 - 1 = 44 \]

Sum","Let X be my age. My brother is X + 3 years old. My sister is X - 2 years old.
My mom is (X + 3) * 3 - 1 years old.
The sum of our ages is X + (X+3) + (X-2) + [(X+3)*3 - 1] = 87 years old.
Multiplying through the parentheses and combining like terms, you get X*6 + 9 = 87 years old.
Subtracting nine from both sides and dividing both sides by 6, you get X = 13 years old.

                    question:
                    Mr. Jackson’s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue . sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will .

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed:**
   - Each student gets 2 glue sticks.
   - There are 27 students.

   \[
   \text{Total glue sticks needed} = 27 \times 2 = 54
   \]

2. **Determine how many packs of glue sticks are required:**
   - Glue sticks come in packs of 8.
   
   To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

   \[
   \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total glue sticks}}{\text{Glue sticks per pack}} = \frac{54}{8}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{54}{8} = 6.75
   \]

4. **Interpret the result:**
   Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, Mr. Jackson needs to round up to the nearest whole number. This means he needs to buy 7 packs (because 6 packs would be insufficient).

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is 7.

**Final Answer:** {The final answer is} 7 packs.<|im_end|>","Mr. Jackson will need 27 x 2 = <<27*2=54>>54 glue sticks.

Since Mr. Jackson must buy whole packs, you must round 6.75 up to the next highest whole number, 7.
Mr. Jackson must buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: The initial amount of water flowing through the river is given as 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain**: After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, we multiply the initial amount by 2:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Third Day Increase**: On the third day, the volume of water increases by an additional 6000 gallons. We add this increase to the amount calculated after the heavy rain:
   \[
   8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Infected Population:**
   - At the start (Day 0), there are 10 people who are initially infected.

2. **Infected People on Day 1:**
   - Each of the 10 infected individuals from Day 0 will infect 6 new people.
   - Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 1 = \( 10 \times 6 \).

3. **Total Number of Infected After Day 1:**
   - Total infected at the end of Day 1 = Initial infected + New infections on Day 1
   - Total infected at the end of Day 1 = \( 10 + (10 \times 6) \)

4. **Infected People on Day 2:**
   - On Day 2, each of the \( 10 + 60 \) infected individuals from Day 1 will infect 6 more people.
   - Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 2 = \( (10 + 60) \times 6 \).

5. **Total Number of Infected After Day 2:**
   - Total infected at the end of Day 2 = Infected at the end of Day 1 + New infections on Day 2
   - Total infected at the end of Day 2 = \( (10 + 60 + (10 + 60) \times 6) \)

6. **Infected People on Day 3:**
   - On Day 3, each of the \( (10 + 60 + 60 \times 6) \) infected individuals from Day 2 will infect 6 more people.
   - Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 3 = \( ((10 + 60 + 60 \times 6) \times 6) \).

7. **Total Number of Infected After Day 3:**
   - Total infected at the end of Day 3 = Infected at the end of Day 2 + New infections on Day 3
   - Total infected at the end of Day 3 = \( (((10 + 60 + 60 \times 6) \times 6) \)

Now let's calculate it step-by-step:

- **Day 1**:
  \[
  \text{New infections} = 10 \times 6 = 60
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total infected after Day 1} = 10 + 60 = 70

  \[
  \text{Total infected after Day 2} = 70 + 420 = 490
  \]

- **Day 3**:
  \[
  \text{New infections} = ((10 + 60 + 60 \times 6) \times 6) = 490 \times 6 = 2940
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total infected after Day 3} = 490 + 2940 = 3430

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tips given to Rafaela.
Rafaela receives $20 from each customer.

Given there were 40 customers, the total amount of tips Rafaela received can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times \$20 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 40 \times \$20 = \$800 \]

So, Rafaela received a total of $800 in tips.

### Step 2: Determine how much more or less money Julieta received compared to Rafaela.
Julieta received 10% less money than Rafaela.

First, let's find out what 10% of Rafaela’s total tips is:
\[ \text{10\% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times \$800 \]
\[ 0.10 \times \$800 = \$80 \]

Since Julieta received 10% less, she actually received:
\[ \$80 - \$80 = \$0 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of tips Julieta received.
Julieta also received $20 per customer.

With 40 customers:
\[ \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 40 \times \$20 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ 40 \times \$20 = \$800 \]

So, Julieta also received a total of $800 in tips.

### Step 4: Find the combined total of tips received by both Julieta and Rafaela.
Adding their amounts together:
\[ \text{Combined total tips} = \$800 + \$800 \]
\[ \$800 + \$800 = \$1600 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is **$1600**.<|im_end|>","The total amount of money that Rafaela received as tips from the forty customers is 40*$20 = $<<40*20=800>>800

### Step 1: Calculate total oranges given away
Jennifer gives:
- Three daughters each getting 2 oranges.
- One son getting 3 oranges.

First, calculate the number of oranges given to the daughters:
\[ \text{Oranges to daughters} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, add the number of oranges given to the son:
\[ \text{Oranges to son} = 3 \]

Total oranges given away:
\[ \text{Total oranges given away} = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the oranges given away from the initial amount
Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. After giving away 9 oranges:

To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a one-year time frame, let's break down the information given:

1. **Claire's Badge Earning Rate**:
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.

2. **Amber's Badge Earning Rate**:
   - Since it takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, we can deduce that for every month Claire spends on earning badges, Amber will spend \(2 \times 1 = 2\) months.
   
3. **Wendy's Badge Earning Rate**:
   - Wendy earns three times the number of badges Claire earns in the same timeframe. Therefore, if Claire earns 1 badge per month, Wendy earns \(3 \times 1 = 3\) badges per month.

4. **Total Badges Earned Over One Year (12 Months)**:
   - For Claire: 
     \[
     \text{Badges} = 12 \times 1 = 12 \text{ badges}
     \]
   - For Amber:
     \[
     \text{Badges} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ badges}
     \]
   - For Wendy:
     \[
     \text{Badges} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ badges}
     \]

5. **Comparing Wendy's and Amber's Total Badges**:
   - To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber over a one-year period, we calculate the difference between their totals:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 36 - 24 = 12 \text{ badges}
     \]

Therefore, Wendy earns 12 more badges than Amber in a one-year time frame. The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Claire earns 1 badge every month so over 12 months she earns 1*12 = <<1*12=12>>12 badges

                    Every hour, , Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven.  Each banana ! bread loaf is cut into 8 slices and wrapped individually for sale.  Each slice is , sold for 50 cents for , a fundraiser.  If she baked from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM straight, and ? sold all the slices, how much did she raise in dollars?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Paige raised, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours worked**
Paige bakes every hour for 5 hours.

\[ \text{Total hours} = 5 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked**
Since she bakes 2 loaves per hour and works for 5 hours,

\[ \text{Total loaves} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices**
Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.

\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 \times 8 = 80 \]

**Step 4: Determine the revenue from selling all slices**
Each slice sells for $0.50 (since it's listed as ""sold for 50 cents"").

\[ \text{Revenue per slice} = \$0.50 \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 80 \times 0.50 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the amount raised by Paige in dollars is **$40**.<|im_end|>","From 1pm - 6pm, there are 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours.

                    Gretchen . has some coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If she had 70 gold coins, how many coins did Gretchen have in total?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of silver coins Gretchen has first, then add that to the number of gold coins.

1. **Identify the relationship between gold and silver coins**:
   - We know there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.
   
2. **Define variables**:
   - Let \( G \) represent the number of gold coins.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins.

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information**:
   - According to the problem, \( G = S + 30 \).

4. **Substitute the known value for gold coins**:
   - We are told that Gretchen has 70 gold coins, so \( G = 70 \).
   
5. **Substitute into the equation**:
   - Substitute \( G = 70 \) into \( G = S + 30 \):
     \[
     70 = S + 30
     \]
   
6. **Solve for silver coins**:
   - Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     70 - 30 = S
     \]
     \[
     S = 40
     \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

7. **Calculate the total number of coins**:
   - Add the number of gold coins (70) to the number of silver coins (40):
     \[
     Total = Gold Coins + Silver Coins
     \]
     \[
     Total = 70 + 40
     \]
     \[
     Total = 110

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Burritos Ordered**: George orders 600 burritos.
2. **Number of Students**: There are 50 students in the class.
3. **Burritos per Student**: Each student gets 10 burritos.

First, we need to determine how many burritos are distributed among the students:

\[
\text{Total burritos distributed} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total burritos distributed} = 50 \times 10 = 500
\]

Next, we subtract this amount from the total number of burritos ordered:

\[
\text{Remaining burritos} = \text{Total burritos ordered} - \text{Total burritos distributed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining burritos} = 600 - 500 = 100
\]

After distributing the burritos, Mr. George eats 20 more burritos. Therefore, we subtract these 20 burritos from the remaining:

\[
\text{Final number of leftover burritos} = \text{Remaining burritos} - \text{Burritos eaten by Mr. George}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Final number of leftover burritos} = 100 - 20 = 80
\]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 80.<|im_end|>","The total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50*10 = <<50*10=500>>500

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To determine the number of yellow cars at the bumper car rink, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cars.
Given that there are 12 red cars and there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars:
\[ \text{Number of green cars} = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of blue cars.
Given that there are 3 times the number of green cars as the number of blue cars:
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = \frac{\text{Number of green cars}}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]
Since the number of cars must be an integer, let's re-evaluate this part carefully.

We know from previous calculations that:
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \]
This suggests there might be a mistake or misinterpretation. Let’s correct it:

Given \( \frac{10}{3} \) should be an exact division, so:
\[ \text{Number of blue cars} = \frac{10}{3} = 3 \] (since the number of cars must be an integer)

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of red and green cars.
\[ \text{Total red and green cars} = 12 (\text{red}) + 10 (\text{green}) = 22 \]

### Step 4: Determine the number of yellow cars.
Given the total number of cars is 75:
\[ \text{Total yellow cars} = 75 - \text{Total red and green cars} = 75 - 22 = 53 \]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>middleware
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books each person has based on the given information.

Let's define the number of books Fawn has as \( x \).

From the problem statement:
- Fawn has \( x \) books.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has \( x - 12 \) books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( (x - 12) + 25 = x + 13 \) books.

We know that together they have 85 books:
\[ \text{Sofie} + \text{Anne} + \text{Fawn} = 85 \]

Substituting their quantities in terms of \( x \):
\[ (x + 13) + (x - 12) + x = 85 \]

Now let's simplify and combine like terms:
\[ x + 13 + x - 12 + x = 85 \]
\[ 3x + 1 = 85 \]

Next, subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 3x = 84 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{84}{3} \]
\[ x = 28 \]

So, Fawn has **28** books.<|im_end|>","Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then x + 25 + x + 12 + x = 85
3x + 37 = 85

Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Keenan spends per week given that Madeline pays 60% of the total grocery costs for a four-week period.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Cost Per Week**:
   - The total monthly cost is $400.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Cost} = \frac{\$400}{4 \text{ weeks}} = \$100 \text{ per week}
     \]

2. **Determine Madeline's Share**:
   - Madeline pays 60% of the total cost per week.
   - To find out how much Madeline spends per week, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Madeline's Weekly Cost} = 0.60 \times \$100 = \$60 \text{ per week}
     \]

3. **Calculate Keenan's Share**:
   - Since Madeline pays 60%, then Keenan must pay the remaining 40% of the total cost per week.
   - To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we subtract Madeline’s share from the total weekly cost:
     \[
     \text{Keenan's Weekly Cost} = \$100 - \$60 = \$40 \text{ per week}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day**

- Total pieces in the pizza = 60
- Fraction of pieces eaten on the first day = \( \frac{2}{5} \)

\[
\text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = 60 \times \frac{2}{5}
\]

Calculate this multiplication:

\[
60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24
\]

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

**Step 2: Subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total**

\[
60 - 24 = 36
\]

Now, there are 36 pieces left after the first day.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day**

- Number of pieces eaten on the second day = 10

Subtract this from the remaining pieces:

\[
36 - 10 = 26
\]

So, Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the third day**

- Remaining pieces after the second day = 26
- Fraction of pieces eaten on the third day = \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces

\[
\text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = 26 \times \frac{7}{13}
\]

Calculate this multiplication:

\[
26 \times \frac{7}{13} = 2 \times 7 = 14
\]

So, Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day.

**Step 5: Add up all the pieces eaten**

\[
24 (\text{first day}) + 10 (\text{second day}) + 14 (\text{third day})
\]

Add these numbers together:

\[
24 + 10 + 14 = 48
\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten so far is **48**.<|im_end|>","On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5*60 = <<2/5*60=24>>24 pieces of the pizza.

The number of pieces of pizza remaining is 60-34 = <<60-34=26>>26
On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13*26 = <<7/13*26=14>>14 pieces of pizza.
So far, he has eaten 14+34 = <<14+34=48>>48 pieces of the pizza he bought.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the price per bottle for both soda and water first.

### Step 1: Calculate the price per bottle of soda.
Given that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of soda} = \frac{\$21.00}{7}
\]

\[
\text{Price per bottle of soda} = \$3.00
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the price per bottle of water.
We know that four bottles of water cost $8.00:

\[
\text{Price per bottle of water} = \frac{\$8.00}{4}
\]

\[
\text{Price per bottle of water} = \$2.00
\]

### Step 3: Determine the total cost if David buys 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.
First, calculate the cost for 3 bottles of soda:

\[
\text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times \$3.00
\]

\[
\text{Cost for 3 bottles of soda} = \$9.00
\]

Next, calculate the cost for 2 bottles of water:

\[
\text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times \$2.00
\]

\[
\text{Cost for 2 bottles of water} = \$4.00
\]

Finally, add these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$9.00 + \$4.00
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$13.00

                    question:
                    David has $12.48 and wants to buy 16 bolts from a bin at the hardware store. Each bolt costs $0.03. How much money does David have left after paying . for the bolts?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 16 bolts**
Each bolt costs $0.03. Therefore, the total cost for 16 bolts would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 16 \times 0.03 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 0.48 \]

So, the total cost for buying 16 bolts is $0.48.

**Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's initial amount of money**
David initially had $12.48. After spending $0.48 on bolts, his remaining money can be found by subtracting the total cost from his initial amount:

\[ \text{Remaining Money} = 12.48 - 0.48 \]

\[ \text{Remaining Money} = 12.00 \]

Therefore, after purchasing the bolts, David will have $12.00 left.

**Final Answer: The final answer is**

\[
\boxed{\$12.00}
\]<|im_end|>","David paid 16 * 0.03 = $<<16*0.03=0.48>>0.48 for the bolts.
David has $12.48 - $0.48 = $12 left.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Ella will earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Ella's hourly wage
First, let's find out how much money Ella earns per hour.

Ella earned $33 in 3 hours.
Hourly wage = Total earnings / Number of hours worked
              = $33 / 3 hours
              = $11 per hour

### Step 2: Calculate her earnings for 12 hours
Now that we know Ella earns $11 per hour, we can calculate how much she will earn if she works for 12 hours.

Total earnings = Hourly wage × Number of hours worked
                = $11/hour × 12 hours
                = $132

### Conclusion
Therefore, if Ella continues to walk dogs at the same rate, she would earn **$132** after 12 hours of work.

{The final answer is} $132.<|im_end|>","Ella earned $33 / 3 hours of dog walking = $<<33/3=11>>11 per hour.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul had after receiving more from his friend.**

Paul initially had 52 marbles.
His friend then gave him 28 more marbles.

Total marbles after receiving from friend = Initial marbles + Marbles given by friend
= 52 + 28
= 80 marbles

**Step 2: Determine how many marbles Paul lost.**

Paul lost \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his total marbles after receiving more from his friend.

Number of marbles lost = Total marbles after receiving × Fraction lost
= 80 × \(\frac{1}{4}\)
= 20 marbles

**Step 3: Calculate the number of marbles Paul has left after losing some.**

Marbles remaining after loss = Total marbles after receiving - Marbles lost

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points Amy earns from her correct answers on the different types of questions. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Points for Multiple-Choice Questions
Amy correctly answers 80% of the 10 multiple-choice questions.
\[ \text{Number of correct multiple-choice questions} = 0.80 \times 10 = 8 \]

Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point.
\[ \text{Points from multiple-choice questions} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Points for True/False Questions
Amy correctly answers 90% of the 20 true/false questions.
\[ \text{Number of correct true/false questions} = 0.90 \times 20 = 18 \]

Each true/false question is worth 5 points.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many chickens Isaias actually sells.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those chickens.
3. Find out how much money Isaias spent on buying those chickens.

**Step 1: Determine how many chickens Isaias actually sells**

Isaias plans to sell \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his 300 chickens. 

\[
\text{Number of chickens sold} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling those chickens**

Each chicken is sold for $50.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times \$50 = \$9000
\]

**Step 3: Find out how much money Isaias spent on buying those chickens**

Since Isaias made a profit of $2000 from selling the chickens, we can determine how much he originally bought them for. The cost price (CP) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost Price}
\]

Given that the profit is $2000, we can rearrange the equation to find the CP:

\[
\$2000 = \$9000 - \text{Cost Price}
\]

Solving for Cost Price:

\[
\text{Cost Price} = \$9000 - \$2000 = \$7000
\]

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for **$7000**.<|im_end|>","Isaias plans to sell 3/5*300 = <<3/5*300=180>>180 chickens from his farm.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many more glasses Julie sold compared to Micah, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of glasses sold.
Julie sold 14 glasses, and the boys (Micah and Mitchell) sold an equal number of glasses.

Let's denote the number of glasses sold by each boy as \( x \).

So, the equation representing the total sales is:
\[ 14 + 2x = 32 \]

Step 2: Solve for \( x \).
First, subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 32 - 14 \]
\[ 2x = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses, and Mitchell also sold 9 glasses.

Step 3: Calculate how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah.
Since Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, we calculate the difference:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is 5.<|im_end|>","Micah and Mitchell sold 32 - 14 = <<32-14=18>>18 glasses.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the cost of a manicure:**
   - We know that Iris spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) of what she spent on her hair.
   - She spent $400 on her hair.

   Therefore, the cost for a manicure can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times \$400 = \$100
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of a pedicure:**
   - The problem states that Iris spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much on a pedicure as on a manicure.
   - She already knows the cost of a manicure is $100.

   So, the cost for a pedicure is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times \$100 = \$75
   \]

3. **Sum up all costs:**
   - Now we add up the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$400 (\text{hair}) + \$100 (\text{manicure}) + \$75 (\text{pedicure})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$400 + \$100 + \$75 = \$675

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much Sarah's friend would spend on the original rope**
- The length of the original rope is 20 meters.
- The price per meter is $2.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Length} \times \text{Price per meter} \]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 \text{ meters} \times \$2/\text{meter}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$40
\]

So, her friend would spend $40 on the original rope.

**Step 2: Determine how much money Sarah has initially**
- We don't know how much money Sarah had initially, so let's assume she starts with $X.

**Step 3: Calculate how much Sarah can save from selling the original rope**
- Since she sold it for $40, she saved $40 in total.

**Step 4: Calculate how much money Sarah needs to buy the new rope**
- The new rope costs $1.5 per meter.
- Let \( y \) be the number of meters of the new rope she buys.

\[ \text{Cost per meter of new rope} = \$1.5 \]

\[ \text{Total cost of new rope} = \text{Number of meters} \times \text{Cost per meter} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = y \times \$1.5 \]

Since she sells the old rope for $40, the amount of money she saves is equal to the amount she spends on the new rope.

**Step 5: Set up an equation to find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy**

\[ 40 = y \times \$1.5 \]

Solve for \( y \):

\[ y = \frac{40}{\$1.5} \]

\[ y = \frac{40}{1.5} \]

\[ y = 26.67 \] (rounded down to 26 since you can't buy a fraction of a meter)

So, Sarah can buy approximately 26 meters of the new rope.

**Step 6: Calculate the remaining money after buying the new rope**

Let's say Sarah started with $Y.

If she buys 26 meters of the new rope, she will spend:

\[ 26 \times \$1.5 = \$39 \]

So, she will have:

\[ Y - \$39 \]

But since we're not given the initial amount \( Y \), we can only express the remaining money as:

\[ Y - \$39 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{\text{Sarah will have } Y - \$39 \text{ dollars left over}} \]

This represents the amount of money Sarah will have left over after she buys the new rope.<|im_end|>","Her friend pays her $40 for the rope because 20 x 2 = <<20*2=40>>40

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Melanie's current age.
- We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.
- Therefore, to find her current age, we subtract 10 from 18.

\[ \text{Melanie's current age} = 18 - 10 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of years required for her age to be three times her current age.
- Let \( x \) represent the number of years after which her age will be three times her current age.
- Her age in \( x \) years will be \( 3 \times (\text{current age}) \).

Given:
\[ 3 \times (\text{current age}) = (\text{current age} + x) \]

### Step 3: Solve the equation.
Substitute the current age found in Step 1 into the equation from Step 2:

\[ 3 \times (18 - 10) = (18 - 10 + x) \]
\[ 3 \times 8 = 8 + x \]
\[ 24 = 8 + x \]

Now, isolate \( x \):

\[ x = 24 - 8 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie’s age will be three times her current age. {The final answer is } 16 years.<|im_end|>","Melanie's present age is 18 - 10 = <<18-10=8>>8.

                    ! Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much money Kelly has left after her purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of the bacon.
2. Determine the cost of the chicken based on its relationship to the bacon.
3. Calculate the cost of the strawberries.
4. Calculate the cost of the apples.
5. Sum up all the costs.
6. Subtract this total from Kelly's budget.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Cost of Bacon
Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.

\[
\text{Cost of bacon} = \$10
\]

### Step 2: Cost of Chicken
Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Since the bacon costs $1 per pack, the chicken costs:

\[
\$1 \times 2 = \$2 \text{ per pack}
\]
Since there are 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is:

\[
6 \times \$2 = \$12
\]

### Step 3: Cost of Strawberries
Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4.

\[
\text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times \$4 = \$12
\]

### Step 4: Cost of Apples
Kelly has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a strawberry pack. Each strawberry pack costs $4, so an apple pack costs:

\[
\frac{\$4}{2} = \$2 \text{ per pack}
\]
Therefore, the total cost of the apples is:

\[
7 \times \$2 = \$14
\]

### Step 5: Total Cost of All Items
Now, let's sum up all the costs:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \$10 (\text{bacon}) + \$12 (\text{chicken}) + \$12 (\text{strawberries}) + \$14 (\text{apples})

The strawberries will cost her 3 packs of strawberries * $4 per pack of strawberries = $<<3*4=12>>12.
Each pack of apples costs Kelly $4 per pack of strawberries / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.
So all of the apples will cost her a combined total of 7 packs of apples * $2 per pack of apples = $<<7*2=14>>14.
In total, Kelly’s shopping so far costs $10 for bacon + $24 for chicken + $12 for strawberries + $14 for apples = $<<10+24+12+14=60>>60.

                    question:
                    Elaina is holding the final concert in her tour. To celebrate her final concert, she makes the concert twice as long as her usual concerts. At the end of the concert, she also performs a 15-minute encore. If the runtime of this final concert . is 65 minutes then how long, in minutes, do her usual concerts run for?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total duration of Elaina's final concert including the encore.
Elaina's final concert lasts 65 minutes.

### Step 2: Calculate the length of Elaina's regular concert without the encore.
Since the final concert is twice as long as her regular concert, we can set up an equation to find the regular concert length.

Let \( x \) represent the length of Elaina's regular concert in minutes.

Given that the final concert is twice as long:
\[ 2x = 65 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{65}{2} \]
\[ x = 32.5 \]

### Conclusion:
Elaina's regular concert runs for 32.5 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32.5}
\]<|im_end|>","The concert, minus the encore, lasted for 65-minute concert – 15-minute encore = <<65-15=50>>50 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of toys given away:**
   - Argo gives 40 toys to Alyssa.
   - Argo gives 80 toys to Bonnie.
   - Argo gives 30 toys to Nicky.

2. **Add up all the toys given away:**

\[
40 \text{ (Alyssa)} + 80 \text{ (Bonnie)} + 30 \text{ (Nicky)}
\]

\[
= 40 + 80 + 30
\]

\[
= 150
\]

So, Argo has given away a total of 150 toys.

3. **Subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:**

\[
200 \text{ (initial number of toys)} - 150 \text{ (toys given away)}
\]

\[
= 200 - 150
\]

\[
= 50
\]

Therefore, after giving away the toys, Argo has 50 toys left.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** The final answer is 50.<|im_end|>","After Argo gives 40 toys to Alyssa, he remains with 200-40 =<<200-40=160>>160

To determine how many chimichangas Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes in total over the three specified days, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day.
- **Tuesday**: They make 125 chimichangas.
- **Wednesday**: They make 125 chimichangas.
- **Friday**: They make twice as many chimichangas as on Wednesday.

Since they make 125 chimichangas on Wednesday, on Friday they would make:
\[ 2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas} \]

### Step 2: Sum up the chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
We add the chimichangas from each of the three days together:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 \]

### Step 3: Perform the addition.
Let's calculate this sum:
\[ 125 + 125 = 250 \]
\[ 250 + 250 = 500 \]

To determine what percentage of Mrs. Smith's plants are flowering plants, let's follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of indoor plants:**
   - Total number of plants = 100
   - Fraction of indoor plants = 1/4
   \[
   \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25

2. **Determine the number of remaining plants after accounting for indoor plants:**
   - Remaining plants = Total plants - Indoor plants
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 100 - 25 = 75

3. **Calculate the number of outdoor plants:**
   - Fraction of remaining plants that are outdoor = 2/3
   \[
   \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50

4. **Determine the number of flowering plants:**
   - Since all remaining plants are either indoor or outdoor (after removing the indoor ones), they must be flowering.
   \[
   \text{Number of flowering plants} = 75

5. **Calculate the percentage of flowering plants:**
   - Percentage of flowering plants = (\(\frac{\text{Number of flowering plants}}{\text{Total number of plants}}\)) \(\times 100\)
   \[
   \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100 = 75\%

To determine how fast the whirligig spins, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the whirligig relative to the thingamabob.
We know that the whatchamacallit (which is likely a thingamabob) spins at 121 meters per second.

Given:
- The whatchamacallit spins at **11** times faster than the thingamabob.
- Therefore, the whirligig must spin **11 times faster** than the thingamabob.

### Step 2: Calculate the whirligig's speed.
Since the whirligig spins **11 times faster** than the thingamabob, its speed will be **11 times** the speed of the thingamabob.

Calculation:
\[ \text{Whirligig's speed} = 11 \times \text{thingamabob's speed} \]

Substitute the given value for the thingamabob's speed:
\[ \text{Whirligig's speed} = 11 \times 121 \text{ meters/second} \]

### Step 3: Perform the multiplication.
\[ 11 \times 121 = 1331 \text{ meters/second} \]

Therefore, the whirligig spins at **1331 meters per second**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is } 1331 \text{ meters per second}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the yogurt.
- Ellen spends $6 on the salad.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad.

\[
\text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{\$6}{2} = \$3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the yogurt.
- Since there is only one yogurt per day, the total cost for the yogurt is:

\[
\$3
\]

### Step 3: Deduct the yogurt cost from the total daily spending.
- Total daily spending: $11
- Cost of yogurt: $3

\[
\text{Remaining budget for other items} = \$11 - \$3 = \$8
\]

### Step 4: Determine the cost of the salad.
- Salad costs $6.

### Step 5: Subtract the salad cost from the remaining budget to find out how much is left for carrots.
- Remaining budget after salad: $8
- Cost of salad: $6

\[
\text{Remaining budget for carrots} = \$8 - \$6 = \$2
\]

### Step 6: Determine the number of carrots Ellen buys.
- Ellen eats 2 carrots per day.

### Step 7: Calculate the cost of one carrot.
- Total budget spent on carrots: $2
- Number of carrots: 2

\[
\text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\$2}{2} = \$1
\]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\boxed{\$1}<|im_end|>","Ellen's yogurt cost is half the price of the salad, so it's $6 / 2 = $<<6/2=3>>3.

To determine how much Mark makes in a week after his raise, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Mark's original weekly earnings**

- **Hours worked per week**: 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 40 hours/week
- **Original hourly wage**: $10/hour

\[ \text{Original weekly earnings} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \times \$10/\text{hour} \]

\[ \text{Original weekly earnings} = \$400 \]

**Step 2: Apply the raise**

- **Raise amount per hour**: $2/hour

- **New hourly wage**: Original wage + Raise

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = \$10/\text{hour} + \$2/\text{hour} \]

\[ \text{New hourly wage} = \$12/\text{hour} \]

**Step 3: Calculate Mark's new weekly earnings**

                    question:
                    Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The : first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as ; many times as she did Joe's. The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn ; five , times as she did Joe's. If ; Joe ; paid Tasha $6 for her work, how much did she make from lemonade sales?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( L \) be the number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn.
   - Since she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, we can say \( L = 3J \).
   - She also mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's, so \( L = 5J \).

2. **Express the total earnings in terms of \( J \):**
   - We know that last month Tasha made $80 from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns.
   - Let \( S \) represent the amount she made from lemonade sales.

3. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - From the problem, we have two conditions about how often Tasha mowed different lawns:
     \[
     L = 3J \quad \text{and} \quad L = 5J
     \]
   - Both expressions must equal \( L \), but they cannot simultaneously be true because \( 3J \neq 5J \). This indicates an inconsistency unless we assume she mowed more than one time for each person or there was some error in the problem statement. However, since we need to proceed, let's focus on the mowing activity only for now.

4. **Calculate the total money earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Let's denote the amount she mowed per unit of time at Joe's yard as \( M_J \).
   - Similarly, let \( M_A \) be the amount she mowed per unit of time at Alba's yard.
   - According to the problem, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as Joe's, so if \( x \) is the number of times she mowed Joe's yard, then \( L = 3x \).

5. **Relate the mowing amounts to the total earnings:**
   - Given \( L = 3x \) and \( L = 5y \), we can express \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( J \):
     \[
     x = \frac{L}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{L}{5}
     \]

6. **Determine the total money earned from mowing lawns:**
   - Total money earned from mowing lawns is:
     \[
     3M_J + 5M_A
     \]
   - To find out how much she made from mowing lawns, we need to determine the values of \( M_J \) and \( M_A \) based on the total earnings from both activities.

7. **Calculate the remaining money after accounting for mowing lawns:**
   - After earning money from mowing lawns, subtract the earnings from mowing lawns from the total earnings to get the amount from lemonade sales:
     \[
     S = 80 - (3M_J + 5M_A)
     \]

8. **Solve for the unknowns using the given information:**
   - We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for his work. Therefore, \( S = 6 \).

9. **Substitute into the equation for total earnings:**
   - Substitute \( S = 6 \) back into the equation:
     \[
     6 = 80 - (3M_J + 5M_A)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( M_J \) and \( M_A \):

10. **Final calculation:**
    - Solve for \( M_J \) and \( M_A \) and use them to find the amount from lemonade sales.

After completing these steps, you will have determined the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales. This process ensures accuracy in solving the problem systematically.<|im_end|>","At Kamala's Tasha made three times what she made mowing Joe's lawn, which gives 3 * 6 = <<3*6=18>>18 dollars
Since the lawn mowing sessions at Alba's were 5 times those at Joe's Tasha also made 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 dollars.
Adding up all the money earned from lawn mowing gives 6 + 18 + 30 = <<6+18+30=54>>54 dollars
Subtracting the lawn mowing money from the total amount gives us 80 - 54 = <<80-54=26>>26 dollars
Tasha therefore made 26 dollars selling lemonade.

To determine the weight of Harry, we need to follow the given information step-by-step.

1. **Martin's Weight**:
   - Martin weighs 55 kg.
   
2. **Carl's Weight**:
   - Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.
     \[
     \text{Carl's weight} = \text{Martin's weight} + 16 \text{ kg}
     \]
     Substituting Martin's weight:
     \[
     \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \text{ kg} + 16 \text{ kg} = 71 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Christian's Weight**:
   - Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.

4. **Harry's Weight**:
   - Harry weighs 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
     \[
     \text{Harry's weight} = \text{Christian's weight} - 5 \text{ kg}
     \]
     Substituting Christian's weight:
     \[
     \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \text{ kg} - 5 \text{ kg} = 74 \text{ kg}
     \]

### Conclusion:

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time.  He gets paid ? $25 an hour.  If his car payment is $500, how much profit does he make on his car?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total earnings from renting out the car:**
   - Number of times rented per month = 10
   - Hours rented per time = 3
   - Payment per hour = $25
   
   Total earnings can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = (\text{Number of Times}) \times (\text{Hours Per Time}) \times (\text{Payment Per Hour})
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = (10) \times (3) \times (25)
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 30 \times 25 = 750
   \]

3. **Subtract the monthly car payment from total earnings to find the profit:**
   - Car payment per month = $500
   
   Profit calculation:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Car Payment}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 750 - 500 = 250

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of notebooks Joseph initially has.
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of notebooks Martha initially has.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**
   - According to the information given, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha:
     \[
     J = 3M
     \]

3. **Update Martha's Situation:**
   - Martha buys 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks:
     \[
     M + 5 = 7
     \]
   - Solving for \( M \):
     \[
     M = 7 - 5 = 2
     \]

4. **Determine Joseph's Number of Notebooks:**
   - Using the equation from Step 2, we can find out how many notebooks Joseph originally had:
     \[

                    question:
                    Dijana and Anis ? live near a lake, and every weekend they go out rowing into the lake. On a Sunday morning, both went out rowing, and Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed on ; that day.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To calculate the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed together on that day, we'll follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine Anis's rowing distance.
Given that Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana, we can express this relationship as follows:
- Let \( D \) represent the distance Dijana rowed (which is 50 miles).
- Therefore, Anis rowed \( 1 + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{6}{5} \) times more than Dijana.

Step 2: Calculate Anis's rowing distance.
\[ 
\text{Anis's distance} = D + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times D \right) 
= 50 + \left( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \right)
= 50 + 10 
= 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Sum the distances.
Now, add the distances Dijana and Anis rowed to find the total distance they covered together.

\[ 
\text{Total distance} = Dijana's \text{distance} + Anis's \text{distance}
= 50 + 60 
= 110 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is **110 miles**.<|im_end|>","Anis rowed for 1/5 * 50 = <<1/5*50=10>>10 more miles than Dijana.
The total distance Anis covered is 50 + 10 = <<50+10=60>>60 miles.
The two of them rowed for 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 miles on that day.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup available:**
   - The pot can hold enough soup to fill 4 adult's bowls.
   - Since Calvin is cooking soup for himself and his family, we need to consider that he is also part of the family.
   - Therefore, if there are 5 people (Calvin + his wife + 2 children), they would eat 5 bowls worth of soup.

2. **Calculate the number of bowls per person:**
   - There are 8 child bowls in total.
   - We need to determine how many bowls per person are left after accounting for the adults' bowls.
   - Since 5 bowls were used for adults, the remaining soup can be divided among the 3 children.
   - Number of bowls per child = Total child bowls / Number of children = 8 / 3 ≈ 2.67 bowls per child.

3. **Account for whole bowls:**
   - Each child needs to have a full bowl of soup, so we round up because even a fraction of a bowl still counts as a complete bowl for lunch purposes.
   - This means each child gets 3 bowls of soup for lunch.

4. **Verify the total number of bowls used:**
   - Adults' bowls: 5
   - Children's bowls: 3 * 3 = 9
   - Total bowls used = 5 (adults) + 9 (children) = 14 bowls

Since the pot only holds 8 child bowls, the remaining soup is insufficient for all children to get their full lunch bowls. However, since the question asks about lunch from the leftovers, we should focus on what can be provided without exceeding the limit of the pot.

Therefore, each child will be able to have 3 bowls of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. 

{The final answer is} 3 bowls of soup per child for lunch from the leftover soup.<|im_end|>","Four adult bowls equal eight children’s bowls, so each adult bowl is 8 / 4 = <<8/4=2>>2 children’s bowls.

Thus, he, his wife, and their children will eat 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 children’s bowls at dinner.
After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = <<8-6=2>>2 children’s bowls left over.

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items William purchased.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the notebooks**
- Each notebook costs $1.50.
- William bought 5 notebooks.

\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break down the information given and solve this step-by-step:

1. **Information provided:**
   - Jo makes ""x"" number of masks.
   - For x = 4, she uses 2 yards of material for small masks.
   - For x = 3, she uses 2.25 yards of material for large masks.

2. **Objective:**
   Calculate how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of material needed per mask type

- **Small Masks (Material per mask):**
  Since 4 small masks use 2 yards of material,
  \[
  \text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \text{ yards}
  \]

- **Large Masks (Material per mask):**
  Since 3 large masks use 2.25 yards of material,
  \[
  \text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 \text{ yards}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total material required for 20 small masks

- Material for 20 small masks:
  \[

To determine how much free time Harold has in his day, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate Harold's work hours**
- Harold works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
- He sleeps for 10 hours a night.

\[
\text{Work hours} = \text{Sleeping hours} - 2
\]

Substitute the sleeping hours into the equation:

\[
\text{Work hours} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Harold's total daily activities (sleep + work)**
- Add the number of hours he sleeps and the number of hours he works together.

\[
\text{Total activity hours} = \text{Sleeping hours} + \text{Work hours}
\]

Substitute the values from Step 1:

\[
\text{Total activity hours} = 10 + 8 = 18 \text{ hours}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Adam's current age.
2. Use the relationship between their ages from eight years ago to find Adam's current age.

Let's start with step one:

Step 1: Determine Adam's current age.
- We know that Duncan’s age is currently 60.
- Eight years ago, Duncan was \(60 - 8 = 52\) years old.
- According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was twice Adam's age at that time.
- Therefore, Adam's age eight years ago was \(\frac{52}{2} = 26\).

Now, let's move to step two:

Step 2: Find Adam's current age.
- Adam's age eight years ago was 26.
- So, Adam's current age is \(26 + 8 = 34\).

Finally, let's calculate how old Adam will be in 8 years.

Final Answer:
Adam will be \(34 + 8 = 42\) years old in 8 years.

Therefore, the final answer is: The final answer is 42.<|im_end|>","Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many acres Farmer Smith's farm has.
- We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.

Let \( B \) represent the number of acres on Farmer Brown's farm.
- According to the information given, \( B = 200 \).

Step 2: Calculate the number of acres in Farmer Smith's farm.
- The formula for Farmer Smith's farm is \( S = 2B + 100 \).
- Substituting \( B = 200 \) into the equation gives us:
\[ S = 2(200) + 100 \]
\[ S = 400 + 100 \]
\[ S = 500 \]

So, Farmer Smith’s farm has 500 acres.

Step 3: Add the sizes of both farms together.
- Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres.
- Farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres.
- Therefore, the total combined size of both farms is:
\[ Total = B + S \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour**

Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.

- Number of packages = 50 - 10
- Number of packages = 40

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked in an eight-hour workday**

Given that Colby works for an eight-hour day, we need to find out how many hours he spends completing packages.

- Hours worked = 8

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings**

We know Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. So, if he completes 40 packages (from Step 1), his total earnings will be calculated as follows:

- Earnings per package = $0.20
- Total packages completed = 40

Let's calculate his total earnings:

- Total earnings = Earnings per package * Total packages completed
- Total earnings = $0.20 * 40
- Total earnings = $8.00

Therefore, **the final answer is**: The amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is **$8.00**.<|im_end|>","Ten less than fifty is 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 packages per hour.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time spent on solving an extreme Sudoku:**
   - A normal Sudoku puzzle takes John 45 minutes.
   - An extreme Sudoku takes \(4 \times\) as long as a normal one.

2. **Calculate the duration for an extreme Sudoku:**
   - If a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes,
     then an extreme Sudoku will take \(4 \times 45\) minutes.
   
3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To find out how many bottles of water John drinks, we divide the total time (in minutes) by the interval between drinking bottles (half an hour).

5. **Divide the total time by the interval to find the number of bottles:**
   - Each half-hourly intake is equivalent to 1 bottle.
   - Therefore, if John spends 180 minutes on a Sudoku,
     he would drink \( \frac{180}{\frac{1}{2}} \) bottles.

6. **Simplify the division:**

   - He threw 3 pieces of bologna for each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of pieces of bologna is given as 58.

2. **Set up an equation to represent the total number of pieces of bologna:**
   Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons and \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - Since there are 20 red balloons, we have \( r = 20 \).

To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs for his car over a 30-day period, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in 30 days.
- Jon drives 100 miles per day.
- Over 30 days, the total miles driven will be \(100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days}\).

\[
100 \times 30 = 3000 \text{ miles}
\]

Step 2: Determine how many tune-ups Jon needs based on his driving distance.
- Every 1000 miles requires one tune-up.

Since Jon drives 3000 miles, we divide this by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs.

To solve this problem, let's break it down day by day.

**Step 1: Determine how long Bruce worked on Tuesday**
- According to the problem, Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate how long Bruce worked on Wednesday**
- On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday.
- Therefore, if he works for 5 hours on Tuesday, then on Wednesday he works \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

**Step 3: Calculate how long Bruce worked on Thursday**
- On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday.
- Since he worked 10 hours on Wednesday, on Thursday he works \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

**Step 4: Sum up the total number of hours Bruce worked over the three days**
- The total number of hours Bruce worked is the sum of his working hours from Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
- This is \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\).

Therefore, the total number of hours Bruce worked over these three days is **23 hours**.<|im_end|>","On Wednesday, Bruce works for 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 hours.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items they bought.
2. Determine how much allowance they had together.
3. Divide that total by 2 to find out how much each received.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - Cake: $11
   - Balloons: They bought 1 dozen (which is 12) balloons at $0.5 per balloon.
     \[ \text{Total cost of balloons} = 12 \times \$0.5 = \$6 \]
   - Ice cream: They bought 2 tubs of ice cream at $7 each.
     \[ \text{Total cost of ice cream} = 2 \times \$7 = \$14 \]

Now, let's add up all these costs to get the total amount spent:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$6 + \$14 = \$31 \]

Since they combined their allowances to pay for these items, and they ended up spending exactly $31 in total, we can conclude that their combined allowance must have been $31.

Next, since they split this amount equally between themselves:
\[ \text{Each person's allowance} = \frac{\$31}{2} = \$15.5 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{The final answer is}
\]<|im_end|>","There are 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 pairs of balloons in 1 dozen.
The cost for buying a dozen balloons was $0.5 x 6 = $<<0.5*6=3>>3.
The cost of 2 tubs of ice cream was $7 x 2 = $<<7*2=14>>14.
The total cost of their purchases is $11 + $3 +$14 = $<<11+3+14=28>>28.
So their mother gave each of them $28/2 = $<<28/2=14>>14.

2. **Subtract the number of fruits that were eaten from the initial total:**
   - Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

   Subtracting this from the total number of fruits:
   \[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of volleyball players.
We know that there are 6 students playing tennis. According to the problem, twice as many students play volleyball. Therefore:
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times (\text{Number of tennis players}) \]
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 2 \times 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of volleyball players} = 12 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of students involved in sports.
Since each student can only participate in one sport:
- Tennis: 6 students
- Volleyball: 12 students
- Soccer: (Given as 16 boys + 22 girls)

However, since we don't have information about the specific numbers for soccer, we'll assume they are separate groups or individuals.

### Step 3: Add up all the students.
Now, summing up all the participants from different sports:
\[ \text{Total students} = \text{Tennis players} + \text{Volleyball players} + \text{Soccer players} \]
\[ \text{Total students} = 6 + 12 + (\text{Soccer players}) \]

### Step 4: Find out if there are enough students for soccer.
Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of soccer players, let’s denote the number of soccer players as \( x \).

So,
\[ \text{Total students} = 6 + 12 + x \]

### Final Answer:
Assuming the number of soccer players is not specified but given that each student only participates in one sport, the total number of students would be:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
- Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.

\[
\text{Total lollipops} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Lollipops per student}
\]

\[
\text{Total lollipops} = 30 \times 10 = 300
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
- The price at which each lollipop was sold was $0.5.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total lollipops} \times \text{Price per lollipop}
\]

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
- The cost of each lollipop was $0.8.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total lollipops} \times \text{Cost per lollipop}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.8 = 240
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit made from selling the lollipops.
- Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 150 - 240 = -90
\]

### Conclusion:
The class was unable to make any profit from selling the lollipops because the total cost exceeded the total revenue. Therefore, the class did not raise any money from the sale of lollipops.

The final answer is:
{The final answer is} -90.<|im_end|>","The class got $0.8 - $0.5 = $<<0.8-0.5=0.3>>0.3 profit from each lollipop.

   - Larry has 3 cats.
   - He has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs.

2. **Calculate the number of rabbits:**
   - He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
   - Number of rabbits = Dogs - 2 = \(9 - 2 = 7\).

3. **Calculate the number of fish:**
   - He has three times the number of rabbits in his fish tank.
   - Number of fish = Fish = \(3 \times 7 = 21\).

4. **Calculate the number of gerbils:**
   - He has 1/3 the number of fish in his gerbil collection.
   - Number of gerbils = Gerbils = \( \frac{21}{3} = 7\).

5. **Sum up all the pets:**
   - Cats: 3
   - Dogs: 9
   - Rabbits: 7
   - Fish: 21
   - Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = 3 (cats) + 9 (dogs) + 7 (rabbits) + 21 (fish) + 7 (gerbils)

1. **Determine how much bread Josh eats per day:**
   - Abby eats 2 slices per day.
   - Josh eats twice as much as Abby.
   
   Therefore, Josh eats \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) slices per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices in one loaf:**
   - One loaf contains 24 slices.

3. **Calculate how many days the loaf will last if both are eating at their respective rates:**
   - Total slices consumed per day by both together = (Abby's consumption + Josh's consumption)
     \[
     \text{Total slices/day} = 2 \text{ (Abby)} + 4 \text{ (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Divide the total number of slices by the daily consumption to find out how many days the loaf lasts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices per day}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ days}

To determine how many shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the age at which Martha started collecting shells.
- According to the information provided, Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the number of months between her starting year (5) and her 10th birthday.
- Since there are 12 months in a year, from age 5 to age 10 spans 5 full years plus an additional year.
- Therefore, the total number of months is \(5 \times 12 + 12 = 60\) months.

Step 3: Determine the number of shells collected per month.
- Martha collects one shell per month.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of shells collected over the period from age 5 to age 10.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of cups**: Lana starts with 27 cups.
   
2. **Dividing into rows**:
   - She divides these cups into 3 rows.
   - Therefore, each row will have \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) cups.

3. **Equal distribution of chamomile and mint tea**:
   - Since there are 3 rows and equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, each row must have an equal amount of both types of tea.
   - Let's denote the number of chamomile tea cups per row as \( x \).
   - Then the number of mint tea cups per row would also be \( x \).

4. **Cups used for cinnamon tea**:
   - Lana uses the remaining cups (after dividing them into chamomile and mint tea) to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.
   - The number of cups left after forming chamomile and mint tea rows is \( 27 - 9 \times 3 = 0 \), which means all 27 cups were used for either chamomile or mint tea.

5. **Equating the total cups used for chamomile and mint tea**:
   - Since all 27 cups were used for either chamomile or mint tea, we can set up the equation: 
     \[
     9x + 9y = 27
     \]
     where \( x \) is the number of chamomile tea cups per row and \( y \) is the number of mint tea cups per row.
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     9(x + y) = 27
     \]
     \[
     x + y = 3
     \]

6. **Finding the value of \( x \)**:
   - We know that \( x \) represents the number of chamomile tea cups per row.
   - From the above equation, since \( x + y = 3 \) and \( y \) must be an integer, \( x \) must be an even number because \( y \) must be odd to satisfy the equation.
   - The only even number less than 3 is 2.
   - So, \( x = 2 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{The final answer is 2}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the time constraint**: The sloth has 8 hours available for picking berries.
2. **Calculate the total trips required**: Since the sloth climbs down the tree, picks berries, and then climbs back up, we need to consider that the total time spent (down and back) is 4 hours per round trip. Therefore, in 8 hours, the sloth will have 2 trips (since \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \)).
3. **Set up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of berries picked per trip. We know the total number of berries collected must be 24. So, the total number of berries picked over 2 trips should equal 24.
   \[
   2x = 24
   \]
4. **Solve for \( x \)**: Divide both sides by 2 to find \( x \).
   \[
   x = \frac{24}{2} = 12

\[ \text{Volume of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 \]

\[
= 5,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Total Amount of Water Used Over 6 Days
They empty the tank at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days.

\[ \text{Total water used} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} \]

\[
= 3,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Remaining Water in the Tank After 6 Days
Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial volume of water in the tank.

\[ \text{Remaining water} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} \]

\[
= 2,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer
After 6 days, there will be **2,000 gallons** of water remaining in the tank.<|im_end|>","The water pump takes 1/2 *10000 = <<5000=5000>>5000 gallons of the pool's water into the tank.
If 500 gallons of water is used daily for six days, the total amount of water used after six days is 500*6 = <<500*6=3000>>3000 gallons.
The total amount of water remaining in the tank will be 5000-3000 = <<5000-3000=2000>>2000 gallons

                    question:
                    Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the . movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>ystem
Let's break down this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount of money Colby has available in the month.
Colby's parents give him $150 per month.

### Step 2: Calculate how much Colby spends on one movie ticket (Friday).
- Ticket price for Friday = $10
- Cost of popcorn = $8
- Cost of candy = $2

Total cost for one movie ticket on a Friday:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$10 + \$8 + \$2 = \$20 \]

### Step 3: Calculate how much Colby spends on one movie ticket (other days).
- Ticket price for other days = $7
- Cost of popcorn = $8
- Cost of candy = $2

Total cost for one movie ticket on another day:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$7 + \$8 + \$2 = \$17 \]

### Step 4: Determine how much Colby has left after buying tickets.
Since Colby has seen 5 movies on Friday so far, we need to subtract these from his total budget.
- Number of movies Colby has seen so far = 5
- Total cost of tickets for 5 movies on Friday:
\[ \text{Cost} = 5 \times \$20 = \$100 \]
- Remaining money after buying tickets for 5 movies on Friday:
\[ \text{Remaining money} = \$150 - \$100 = \$50 \]

Now, let's calculate how much Colby can buy in the remaining time:
- Number of movies Colby can still see = \( \frac{\$50}{\$20} = 2.5 \)

Since Colby cannot see half a movie, he can only see 2 more movies.

### Step 5: Check if Colby can afford all required items for those movies.
For 2 movies:
- Cost of popcorn for 2 movies:
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16 \]
- Cost of candy for 2 movies:
\[ \text{Cost} = 2 \times \$2 = \$4 \]

Total cost for 2 movies:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$16 + \$4 = \$20 \]

This matches the maximum amount Colby can spend on tickets without exceeding his budget.

Therefore, Colby can now determine the number of movies he can see with the remaining budget:
- Since he has spent exactly enough money on tickets for 2 movies, there is no additional spending on popcorn or candy because they are not part of the ticket purchase.

### Conclusion:
Colby can see **2** more movies in addition to the 5 he has already seen on Friday.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: **2**<|im_end|>","He has spent $50 on Fri/Sat movies because 5 x 10 = <<50=50>>50
He has spent $56 on movies the rest of the day because 8 x 7 = <<8*7=56>>56

He has spent $8 on candy because 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8
He has spent 130 in total because 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = <<50+56+16+8=130>>130
He plans to spend $10 on popcorn and candy because 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10

                    question:
                    Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories and a normal blueberry muffin has . 450 calories. If a mini pastry has 1/3rd of the calories of a normal version, how many calories do the pastries he baked have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>west
To determine the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the calorie content for each type of pastry.
- **Mini Cinnamon Rolls**:
    - Normal cinnamon roll = 600 calories
    - Mini cinnamon roll = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 \) calories
    - Number of mini cinnamon rolls = 200
    - Calories from mini cinnamon rolls = \( 200 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 600 \right) \)

\[
\text{Calories per mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

\[
\text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories}
\]

- **Mini Blueberry Muffins**:
    - Normal blueberry muffin = 450 calories
    - Mini blueberry muffin = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 \) calories
    - Number of mini blueberry muffins = 300
    - Calories from mini blueberry muffins = \( 300 \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \times 450 \right) \)

\[
\text{Calories per mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
\]

\[
\text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Sum up the total calories for all mini pastries.
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls = 40,000 calories
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins = 45,000 calories

\[
\text{Total calories} = 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is \boxed{85000}.<|im_end|>","First find the number of calories in a mini cinnamon roll: 600 calories / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200 calories

Then find the number of calories in a mini blueberry muffin: 450 calories / 3 = <<450/3=150>>150 calories
Then multiply that number by the number of mini blueberry muffins: 150 calories/muffin * 300 muffins = <<150*300=45000>>45000 calories
Then add the number of calories from each type of pastry to find the total number of calories: 45000 calories + 40000 calories = <<45000+40000=85000>>85000 calories

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day over the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   - Monday: 39 Junebugs
   - Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
   - Thursday: 48 Junebugs
   - Friday: 57 Junebugs

   Total removals = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

2. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   Since there are 5 days in the period (Monday to Friday), divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days.

   Average number of Junebugs per day = \(\frac{300}{5} = 60\)

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 60. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 60.<|im_end|>","On both Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many as the 39 on Monday so she removed 2*39 = <<2*39=78>>78 Junebugs

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both the bus and the car, then find the difference between these distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled by the bus**
- The formula for distance is \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
- For the bus, the speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is 5 hours.
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the car**
- Similarly, for the car, the speed is 30 miles per hour and the time is 8 hours.
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

**Step 3: Find the difference in distance**
- To find out how much farther the bus went compared to the car, subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus.
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles more than the car. {The final answer is} 60 miles.<|im_end|>","The bus traveled 60 miles per hour * 5 hours = <<60*5=300>>300 miles.
The car traveled 30 miles per hour * 8 hours = <<30*8=240>>240 miles.
So, the bus went 300 - 240 = <<300-240=60>>60 miles farther than the car.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided and use it to find out how many bouncy balls came in the tube.

1. **Calculate the current total number of toys:**
   - Building blocks: 31
   - Stuffed animals: 8
   - Tower of stacking rings: 9
   - Total so far: \(31 + 8 + 9 = 58\)

2. **Determine the difference between the total number of toys needed and the current total:**
   - Needed total: 62
   - Current total: 58
   - Difference: \(62 - 58 = 4\)

3. **Identify what item corresponds to the remaining 4 toys:**
   - Since we know that Sophie added a tube of bouncy balls (which would be one toy), there must be an additional 4 toys left after accounting for the bouncy ball.
   
4. **Conclude the number of bouncy balls in the tube:**
   - Therefore, the tube contains 4 bouncy balls.

**Final Answer:** 
The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\).<|im_end|>","Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( P \) = Peter's age
- \( J \) = John's age
- \( P + J = 90 \) (since Paul is 10 years older than John)

### Step 2: Use the given information about Paul's age
Paul's age (\(P\)) is also equal to the sum of Peter's age (\(P\)) and John's age (\(J\)):
\[ P = P + J \]

### Step 3: Substitute \( P \) in the equation from Step 2 into the equation from Step 1
From Step 2, we know:
\[ P = P + J \]
This simplifies to:
\[ P - P = J \]
So,
\[ J = 0 \]

However, since ages cannot be zero in real life, there must be an error in our assumption or interpretation. Let's correct it.

### Correcting the Approach
Since Paul is 10 years older than John, if we denote John's age as \( J \), then Paul's age would be \( J + 10 \).

Given:
\[ P + J = 90 \]
And:
\[ P = J + 10 \]

We can substitute \( P \) in the first equation:
\[ (J + 10) + J = 90 \]
Simplify:
\[ 2J + 10 = 90 \]
Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 2J = 80 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ J = 40 \]

Now, using \( J \):
\[ P = J + 10 \]
\[ P = 40 + 10 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

So, Peter's age is **50** years old.<|im_end|>","Let x be the age of John. Paul’s age is x + 10
Peter’s age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10
We have (2x + 10) + (x + 1) + x = 100
Combining like terms, we get 4x + 20 = 100
Subtracting 20 from both sides and dividing by 4, we get x = 80/4 = 20 years old.
John is 20 years old, Paul is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter is 2 * 20 + 10 = 50 years old.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Boxes Needed for the Sale

First, let's determine the total number of boxes that will be donated or brought in.

- **Total boxes from donations**: 
  - Each of the 10 donors donates 5 boxes.
  - Therefore, the total number of boxes from donations = \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) boxes.

- **Existing boxes**:
  - The charity group already has 10 boxes.

So, the total number of boxes needed for the sale is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Tables Needed

Next, we calculate how many tables are required based on the capacity of each table.

- Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.
  
Therefore, the number of tables needed to accommodate all the boxes is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Additional Tables Required

We know that the charity group already owns 15 tables. 

To find out how many more tables are needed beyond these existing ones, we subtract the current number of tables from the total number of tables required:

\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ additional tables} \]

### Conclusion

Thus, the charity group needs an additional **15 tables** to meet their requirement for accommodating the boxes at the yard sale event.<|im_end|>","There were 10*5=<<10*5=50>>50 donated boxes

### Step 3: Find the combined total distance.
We add the distances together because both Zoey and Sydney spit all their seeds.

\[
\text{Combined total distance} = \text{Zoey's distance} + \text{Sydney's distance}
\]
\[
= 400 \, \text{feet} + 420 \, \text{feet}
\]
\[
= 820 \, \text{feet}
\]

### Step 4: Divide the combined total distance by the number of contestants.
There are two contestants (Zoey and Sydney).

\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{\text{Combined total distance}}{\text{Number of contestants}}
\]
\[
= \frac{820 \, \text{feet}}{2}
\]
\[
= 410 \, \text{feet}
\]

### Final Answer:
The average total distance spat by both contestants is \(410\) feet.<|im_end|>","Zoey spits a total distance of 400 feet because 40 x 10 = <<40*10=400>>400
Sydney spits a total distance of 420 feet because 35 x 12 = <<35*12=420>>420
This totals to 820 feet because 400 + 420 = <<400+420=820>>820
The average total distance is 410 because 820 / 2 = <<820/2=410>>410

                    question:
                    Fern is trying to decide between buying the Widgeteer ! 3000, which makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000, which makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6. How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the ; WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much more money Fern would make using the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate daily production:**
   - Widgeteer 3000 produces 60 widgets per hour.
   - WidgetMaster 9000 produces 45 widgets per hour.

2. **Determine total daily production:**
   - For the Widgeteer 3000: 
     \[
     60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
     \]
   - For the WidgetMaster 9000: 
     \[
     45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate monthly production:**
   - Assuming a month has 30 days,
     - Widgeteer 3000: 
       \[
       1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}
       \]
     - WidgetMaster 9000:
       \[
       1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}
       \]

4. **Calculate revenue from each machine:**
   - Each widget sells for $6.
   - Revenue from Widgeteer 3000:
     \[
     43200 \text{ widgets/month} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200 \text{/month}
     \]
   - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000:
     \[
     32400 \text{ widgets/month} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400 \text{/month}
     \]

5. **Find the difference in revenue:**
   - Difference in revenue:
     \[
     \$259200 \text{/month} - \$194400 \text{/month} = \$64800 \text{/month}
     \]

Therefore, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a month. The final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Cameron would save, we need to compare the costs of his two options.

**Option 1: Pay for 12 hours**
- Cost = 1000 pesos

**Option 2: Add an extra 70 pesos per hour after the first 12 hours**

First, calculate the total number of hours Cameron stays:

- Total hours stayed = 12 hours (initial) + 18 hours (additional)
- Total hours stayed = 30 hours

Now, calculate the cost under Option 2:

- Cost for initial 12 hours = 1000 pesos
- Additional hours = 30 - 12 = 18 hours
- Extra cost per hour after 12 hours = 70 pesos/hour
- Total extra cost = 18 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 1260 pesos

Total cost under Option 2:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1000 pesos + 1260 pesos = 2260 pesos \]

Next, calculate the savings compared to the initial payment:

Savings = Initial cost - Final cost
\[ \text{Savings} = 2260 pesos - 1000 pesos = 1260 pesos \]

Therefore, Cameron would save **1260 pesos** by opting for the second option that adds 70 pesos for every hour after the first 12 hours.<|im_end|>","12 hours after 5 pm is 5 am.
If Cameron wants to leave at 10 am, he must pay for an additional 10 am - 5 am = <<10-5=5>>5 hours.
This means that he must pay an additional 70 pesos x 5 hours = <<70*5=350>>350 pesos.
Altogether, he must pay 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = <<1000+350=1350>>1350 pesos.
Therefore, he will save 1600 pesos - 1350 pesos = <<1600-1350=250>>250 pesos.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the amount of hay needed for each animal:**
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs.

2. **Calculate the amount of hay needed per sheep:**
   - Twice the amount of hay needed for one goat = \(2 \times 5\) pounds = 10 pounds.
   - Therefore, each sheep needs \(10 - 3\) pounds = 7 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all goats:**
   - There are 15 goats.
   - Each goat needs 5 pounds.
   - So, the total hay needed for goats = \(15 \times 5\) pounds = 75 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total amount of hay needed for all sheep:**
   - There are 12 sheep.
   - Each sheep needs 7 pounds.
   - So, the total hay needed for sheep = \(12 \times 7\) pounds = 84 pounds.

5. **Add the amounts together to find the total hay needed:**
   - Total hay needed = Hay for goats + Hay for sheep = 75 pounds (goats) + 84 pounds (sheep) = 159 pounds.

Therefore, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay in total. {The final answer is} 159 pounds.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much hay each sheep needs: 5 pounds * 2 - 3 = <<5*2-3=7>>7 pounds/sheep

Now figure out how much hay total the goats need: 5 pounds/goat * 15 goats = <<5*15=75>>75 pounds
Now add the two amounts of hay to find the total: 84 pounds + 75 pounds = <<84+75=159>>159 pounds

### Step 2: Subtract Expenses from Earnings
John spends $50 on gas.
\[ \text{Remaining amount after expenses} = 300 - 50 = \$250 \]

### Step 3: Determine Amount Left After Depositing into Bank
John wants to deposit $100 into the bank.
\[ \text{Amount left after deposits} = 250 - 100 = \$150 \]

### Step 4: Calculate Cost of Pencils

   - Craig has spelled out 20 words, each containing 15 letters.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has used is \(20 \times 15 = 300\).

2. **Determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has used:**
   - According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words that contain 50 more letters than Craig.
   - So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has used is \(300 + 50 = 350\).

3. **Calculate the total number of letters both have used together:**
   - The combined total number of letters used by both Craig and his brother is \(300 + 350 = 650\).

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is \(\boxed{650}\).<|im_end|>","After ten rounds, Craig has spelled out 20*15 = <<20*15=300>>300 letters from the longest letter words he knows.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many children can participate in the drill based on the given conditions.

   - Therefore, the total number of children per school is \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \).

2. **Calculate the total number of schools participating:**
   - There are 5 different schools participating.

3. **Find the total number of children across all schools:**

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice needed.
Each student drinks 2 bottles of apple juice for lunch. With 29 students:

\[ \text{Total bottles needed} = 29 \times 2 = 58 \]

So, the teachers needs 58 bottles of apple juice for lunches.

### Step 2: Determine the total value of the coupons given out.
Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. The teacher has 9 coupons:

\[ \text{Value of coupons} = 9 \times 100 = 900 \]

This means the teacher's coupons are worth $900$ bottles of apple juice.

### Step 3: Subtract the value of the coupons from the total number of bottles needed.
Subtract the value of the coupons (900 bottles) from the total number of bottles needed (58):

\[ \text{Remaining bottles} = 58 - 900 = -842 \]

Since it doesn't make sense mathematically to have negative bottles, let’s re-evaluate if there was an error or misunderstanding. Let's assume the coupons were meant as a reward instead of redemption for lunch. If that’s the case, then the coupons themselves don’t count towards the required bottle amount.

### Step 4: Re-calculate based on the original intent of the problem.
Given the coupons were intended as rewards rather than lunch juice, the teacher would keep them without needing any more apples for her own consumption. 

Thus, she retains her coupons without having to spend any more money or juice.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is}. The teacher keeps her 9 coupons. She doesn't have any additional apple juice left after giving the lunches.<|im_end|>","The teacher can redeem her coupons for 9 * 100 = <<9*100=900>>900 bottles of apple juice.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Patty charged for her plumbing service, we need to break down the costs into their respective components: the visit fee, the hourly rate, and the cost of parts.

1. **Visit Fee**: The initial visit fee is a flat rate of $40.
   \[
   \text{Visit Fee} = \$40
   \]

2. **Labor Cost**: The labor cost is calculated based on the number of hours worked. For this job, it was 2.25 hours.
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = \$35 \times 2.25 = \$81.75
   \]

3. **Parts Cost**: The total amount spent on parts is given as $60.

Now, let's sum up all these costs to find the total charge:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Visit Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \$40 + \$81.75 + \$60

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost without any discount**
- James buys 10 CDs.
- Each CD costs $15.

Total cost = Number of CDs × Cost per CD
= 10 × $15
= $150

**Step 2: Apply the discount to the total cost**
- The discount is 40%.

Discount amount = Total cost × Discount rate
= $150 × 0.40
= $60

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost gives us the discounted price:

Final price after discount = Original total cost - Discount amount
= $150 - $60
= $90

**Step 3: Determine how many CDs James keeps and sells**
- James originally bought 10 CDs.
- He decides not to keep 5 of them.

Number of CDs kept = Original number of CDs - CDs sold
= 10 - 5
= 5

**Step 4: Calculate the selling price of the kept CDs**
- James sells these 5 CDs at 40% above their original value (since they were on sale).

Price increase per CD = Selling price - Original price
= $15 + ($15 × 0.40)
= $15 + $6
= $21

Selling price per CD = Price increase per CD + Original price
= $21 + $15
= $36

**Step 5: Calculate the total revenue from selling the kept CDs**
- James sells all 5 CDs.

Total revenue = Number of CDs sold × Selling price per CD
= 5 × $36
= $180

**Step 6: Calculate the total amount spent and the total revenue**
- The total amount spent is the final price after discount.

Total amount spent = Final price after discount
= $90

- The total revenue from selling the kept CDs.

Total revenue = $180

**Step 7: Find out how much money James is out**
- Subtract the total amount spent from the total revenue.

Money James is out = Total revenue - Total amount spent
= $180 - $90
= $90

Therefore, James is out $90 in total.<|im_end|>","He got a 15*.4=$<<15*.4=6>>6 discount on each CD

                    question:
                    Jen is planning to sell her root crops. She has 6 yams which can be sold at $1.5 each, 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each, and : 4 carrots which cost $1.25 each. If she sells ! everything, how much will she earn?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much Jen will earn from selling all her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings from yams**
- Jen has 6 yams.
- Each yam can be sold for $1.5.
\[
\text{Total earnings from yams} = 6 \times 1.5 = 9
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from sweet potatoes**
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato costs $2.
\[
\text{Total earnings from sweet potatoes} = 10 \times 2 = 20
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the earnings from carrots**
- Jen has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot costs $1.25.
\[
\text{Total earnings from carrots} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5
\]

**Step 4: Sum up the total earnings from all types of crops**
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from yams} + \text{Earnings from sweet potatoes} + \text{Earnings from carrots}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 9 + 20 + 5 = 34
\]

Therefore, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn **$34** in total.<|im_end|>","Jen can earn $1.5 x 6 = $<<1.5*6=9>>9 for the yams.
She can earn $2 x 10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 for the sweet potatoes.

Therefore, she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $<<9+20+5=34>>34 if she sells everything.

                    question:
                    , James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake.  He can swim at a pace ? of 2 miles per hour.  He swims 60% of : the distance.

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James needs to swim:**
   - The lake is 20 miles.

2. **Determine how much of the lake James swam initially:**
   - James swims 60% of the distance.
   - \( 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \) miles.

3. **Calculate the time it takes James to swim these 12 miles at his initial speed:**
   - His swimming speed is 2 miles per hour.
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) hours.

4. **Calculate the rest time (half of the swimming time):**
   - Rest time = \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours.

5. **Calculate the remaining distance James still needs to swim after resting:**
   - Remaining distance = Total distance - Swallowed distance = \( 20 - 12 = 8 \) miles.

6. **Determine James' new swimming speed after resting:**
   - His swimming speed halves when he resumes swimming.
   - New swimming speed = \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) mile per hour.

7. **Calculate the time it takes James to swim the remaining 8 miles at his new speed:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed = \( \frac{8}{1} = 8 \) hours.

8. **Sum up all the times:**
   - Initial swimming time + Rest time + Remaining swimming time = \( 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \) hours.

Therefore, it took James a total of **17 hours** to cross the lake.<|im_end|>","He swam 20*.6=<<20*.6=12>>12 miles.
That took him 12/2=<<12/2=6>>6 hours.

He then swam the remaining 20-12=<<20-12=8>>8 miles.
His pace was 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 mph.
So it took him 8/1=<<8/1=8>>8 hours.
So in total, he took 6+3+8=<<6+3+8=17>>17 hours.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points each person scored based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( A \) represent the number of points Azibo scored.
- Since Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, Bahati scored \( A + 20 \).
- Since Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, Dinar scored \( (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10 \).

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We know that the total points scored by all three individuals is 45. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 30) = 45 \]

Here’s why we added 30 for Dinar:
- We already have Azibo's contribution as \( A \), Bahati's contribution as \( A + 20 \), and Dinar's contribution as \( A + 10 \).
- Adding these contributions together gives us the total points:

\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 30) = 45 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 3A + 50 = 45 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( A \)
Subtract 50 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3A = 45 - 50 \]
\[ 3A = -5 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = \frac{-5}{3} \]
\[ A = -\frac{5}{3} \]

Since the result doesn't make sense in terms of points scored, let's re-evaluate our steps or check if there was an error in interpretation.

Upon rechecking, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The correct approach should yield positive values for points. Let's try again considering integer solutions more likely in such problems.

Revising the setup:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 30) = 45 \]
This simplifies correctly but leads to negative value; thus, reconsidering assumptions may be necessary.

Given the constraints and logical flow, revisiting initial assumptions or conditions might clarify:

Final Check:
Recheck the equations ensuring no algebraic errors were made.

After thorough review:
Azibo scores \( 5 \) points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]<|im_end|>","Let B = the number of points Bahati scored

<|im_start|>user

To determine the number of pages in the book, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the thickness of each sheet of paper.
Given that 100 sheets of paper stack up to 1 inch, we can calculate the thickness per sheet as follows:
\[ \text{Thickness per sheet} = \frac{1 \text{ inch}}{100 \text{ sheets}} = 0.01 \text{ inches per sheet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sheets used for printing.
Since the book is 1.5 inches thick, we need to find out how many sheets are required to reach this thickness:
\[ \text{Total number of sheets} = \frac{1.5 \text{ inches}}{0.01 \text{ inches per sheet}} = 150 \text{ sheets} \]

### Step 3: Determine the number of pages per sheet.
Each sheet has two sides, but only one page is printed on each side. Therefore, each sheet contains:
\[ \text{Pages per sheet} = \frac{1 \text{ page}}{2} = 0.5 \text{ pages per sheet} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pages in the book.
Now, multiply the number of sheets by the number of pages per sheet:
\[ \text{Total number of pages} = 150 \text{ sheets} \times 0.5 \text{ pages per sheet} = 75 \text{ pages} \]

Therefore, the book contains **75 pages**.<|im_end|>","There are 1.5*100=<<1.5*100=150>>150 pieces of paper.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many reports Vince staples in total during his working hours. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Determine the duration of Vince's work.
Vince works for an hour at a time, starting from 8:00 AM and stopping at 11:00 PM.

- From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM: 1 hour
- From 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM: 1 hour
- From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM: 1 hour

Total time worked = 22 hours (since there are 11 periods but one period overlaps into the next day).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of reports Vince staples per hour.
Given that Vince can staple 30 reports in 15 minutes, we first find out how many reports he can staple in 1 minute.

\[ \text{Reports per minute} = \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

Next, calculate the number of reports he can staple in 1 hour (60 minutes):

\[ \text{Reports per hour} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

### Step 3: Multiply the number of reports per hour by the total number of hours worked.
\[ \text{Total reports stapled} = 120 \times 22 = 2640 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, Vince stapled a total of **2640** reports over the course of his workday.

To determine how much time Kim actually spent asleep during that particular day, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Kim's normal sleep schedule**:
   - Sleeps until 10 PM.
   - Wakes up at 6 AM.

2. **Day details**:
   - She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual (at 5:55 AM) for a bathroom break.
   - She went to sleep between 2:15 AM and 2:38 AM that night.

Now, let's calculate her actual sleep duration:

- Her regular sleep start time is 10 PM.
- She woke up at 5:55 AM due to going to the bathroom.

Since we need to find out how long she slept before going to bed at 2:15 AM, we subtract these two times from her regular sleep start time.

First, convert all times to the same format (minutes past midnight):
- Regular sleep start time = 10 PM = 22:00 or 22 * 60 + 0 = 1320 minutes.
- Time she woke up = 5:55 AM = 5 * 60 + 55 = 315 minutes.

Calculate the difference:
\[ \text{Total time awake} = 315 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Time spent asleep} = 1320 - 315 = 905 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Kim actually slept for 905 minutes that day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of cups Jonathan has:**
   - Two dozen cups means \(2 \times 12 = 24\) cups.

2. **Calculate the number of spoons Jonathan has based on the given ratio:**
   - Since Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many spoons as cups, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Number of cups}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of cups:
     \[
     \text{Number of spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
     \]

3. **Subtract the number of spoons gifted to Pedro from the total number of spoons:**
   - Jonathan gives away 6 spoons to Pedro.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of spoons is:
     \[
     16 - 6 = 10
     \]

4. **Add the remaining spoons to the remaining cups to get the total number of utensils:**
   - Remaining cups: 24
   - Remaining spoons: 10
   - Total number of utensils:
     \[
     24 + 10 = 34
     \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining after giving some to Pedro is \(34\).<|im_end|>","A dozen measuring cups are 12, and if Jonathan has two dozens, he has 2*12 = 24 cups.
Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, so he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.
When he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, he remains with 16-6 = <<16-6=10>>10 measuring spoons.
He now has a total of 10 measuring spoons + 24 measuring cups = <<10+24=34>>34 utensils

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    A hospital has ; a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the , coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are ; admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds ; in the hospital after 2 weeks.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

### Step 1: Determine the current occupancy rate
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and is currently at 1/5 occupancy. Let's calculate the current number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Current Occupancy} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily increase in patient numbers
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of days over which we need to calculate unoccupied beds
Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many days (and therefore, how many new admissions) fall within 2 weeks.

First, convert 2 weeks into days:

\[
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
\]

Now, calculate the total number of new admissions over these 14 days:

\[
\text{Total New Admissions} = 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of occupied beds
Subtract the total number of new admissions from the initial number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Remaining Occupied Beds} = 200 \text{ beds} - 700 \text{ patients} = -500 \text{ beds}
\]

Since the calculation results in a negative value, it indicates that all 200 occupied beds have been filled, and no new admissions can occur due to the constraints of the hospital's capacity.

### Conclusion:
After accounting for the 50-day period when 50 patients were admitted each day, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital remains zero because the hospital is already at its full capacity. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 0<|im_end|>","If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.
The total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.
If 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.
After two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.
If there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend per day. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Emails Sent Daily:**
   Robyn sends 16 emails a day.

2. **Work Emails:**
   Out of these 16 emails, seven are work-related.
   
3. **Remaining Emails After Work Emails:**
   Subtract the work emails from the total emails:
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9 \text{ emails}
   \]
   
4. **Emails to Family:**
   Two-thirds of the remaining nine emails are sent to family.
   
5. **Calculate Emails Sent to Family:**
   Calculate two-thirds of the nine emails:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails}
   \]

6. **Emails to Her Boyfriend:**
   The rest of the emails after sending to family are sent to her boyfriend.
   
7. **Calculate Emails Sent to Boyfriend:**
   Subtract the emails sent to family from the remaining emails:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails}
   \]

Therefore, Robyn sends three emails a day to her boyfriend.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 3.<|im_end|>","Robyn sends 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 non-work emails.
She sends 9 * 2 / 3 = <<9*2/3=6>>6 emails to family.
There are 9 - 6 = <<9-6=3>>3 emails remaining.
Of the remaining 3, 1/3 are to her boyfriend, so Robyn sends him 3 * 1 / 3 = <<3*1/3=1>>1 email a day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine Shawna's age:**
   - We know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
   - Aliya is currently 3 years old.
   - Therefore, Shawna's current age = \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) years.

2. **Calculate Shawna's father's age:**
   - Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
   - Shawna's age (already calculated) is 9 years.
   - Therefore, Shawna's father's age = \( 5 \times 9 = 45 \) years.

So, Shawna's father is currently 45 years old.<|im_end|>","Shawna is three times older than Aliya so Shawn is 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 years old.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Courtney stated there were 48 people at the concert.
   - Kelly claims that Courtney's count is incorrect and suggests an overestimation.

2. **Understand Kelly's claim:**
   - Kelly says Courtney has overestimated the number by 20%.

3. **Calculate the correct number based on Kelly's claim:**
   - To find out the actual number of attendees, we need to subtract 20% from 48.
   - First, convert 20% to its decimal form: \( \frac{20}{100} = 0.20 \).

4. **Perform the calculation:**
   - Subtract 0.20 (which represents 20%) from 48.
     \[
     48 - 0.20 \times 48 = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4
     \]

5. **Interpret the result:**
   - The calculation shows that if Courtney's count is indeed overestimated by 20%, then the real number of attendees should be approximately 38.4.

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is 38}.<|im_end|>","Since she overstated the number by 20%, 48 is 20% greater than the actual number i.e. 48 = 100% + 20% = 120% of the actual number = 120/100 of the actual number
Therefore, the actual number = (100/120)*48 = <<(100/120)*48=40>>40

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. **Determine how many balls Jason carried:**
   - According to the information provided, if Jason carried 2 balls, then Jordan carried twice as many.
     \[
     \text{Jason's balls} = 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jordan's balls} = 2 \times 2 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of balls Jason carried (including those he also carried):**
   - Since Jason carries these extra balls too, we need to add his original count to his extra count.
     \[
     \text{Total Jason's balls} = 2 + 2 = 4
     \]

3. **Summarize the total number of balls for each boy:**
   - Jason: 4 balls
   - Jordan: 4 balls
   - Jeffrey: We know Jeffrey did not participate in carrying any balls.

4. **Verify the consistency of the numbers:**
   - Total balls collected by Jason and Jordan should equal the total balls available initially because they collectively took them all.
     \[
     \text{Total balls taken} = 4 (\text{Jason}) + 4 (\text{Jordan}) = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of balls the coach originally brought:**
   - Given that the coach ended up with 8 balls after Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey were allowed to take some from him,
     \[
     \text{Total balls originally brought} = 8

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **First Day**: 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: 8 holes (with 2 filled in).
4. **Fourth Day**: Unearthed treasure.

Let's denote the number of holes discovered on the fourth day as \( H \).

From the information provided:
- By the end of the third day, there were four times as many holes as at the end of the first day. 
- This means that after three days, there were \( 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \) holes.
- Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the first day was \( \frac{31}{4} \). Since we can't have a fraction of a hole, we round up or down based on the context, but since we're dealing with whole holes, we'll assume the exact division gives us 8 holes (as per typical rounding rules).

So, at the end of the first day, there were 8 holes.

Now, considering the fourth day:
- The pirates unearthed a treasure chest on the fourth day, which is represented as \( H \).
- We know that \( H = 1 \) because the treasure chest contains one item.

Thus, the total number of holes dug over the four days is the sum of all individual days plus the treasure chest:
\[ 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 + 1 = 26 \]

Therefore, the pirates dug a total of 26 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{26}\)<|im_end|>","Let X mark the number of holes they dug on the fourth day.
The island had 4 * 10 = <<4*10=40>>40 holes when they found the treasure.

After filling in 2 holes, they had 31 - 2 = <<31-2=29>>29 holes dug.
When they found the treasure, they had 29 + X = 40 holes dug.
Thus, the pirates dug 40 - 29 = <<40-29=11>>11 holes on the fourth day.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips that were available. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of corn chips received by all three.
- Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips.
- Together, they received \( 70 + 70 = 140 \) corn chips.

### Step 2: Determine how many corn chips each person gets when sharing equally.
- There are 3 people sharing the corn chips.
- Each person should get an equal amount, so divide the total by 3: 
\[ \frac{140}{3} = 46.666\ldots \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a corn chip in practical terms, let's round to the nearest whole number for simplicity (though typically, such problems expect exact division):

Each person gets approximately 47 corn chips if divided exactly.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between what one person gets and the others.
- The third person receives 15 more corn chips than the others.
- This means the third person has \( 47 + 15 = 62 \) corn chips.

### Step 4: Verify the total number of corn chips.
- We know Amora and Lainey together have 140 corn chips.
- Since each of them gets 47 corn chips, their combined total is indeed \( 47 \times 2 = 94 \).
- Adding the 62 corn chips the third person has gives us \( 94 + 62 = 156 \).

Thus, the total number of corn chips is **156**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is} 156.<|im_end|>","If Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, they received a total of 70*2 = <<70*2=140>>140 corn chips.

To determine the total cost of travel, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of travel tickets:**
   - The ticket costs 50% more than the supplies.
   - Supplies cost $400.

Let's denote the supply cost as \( S \) and the ticket cost as \( T \).

Given that the ticket costs 50% more than the supplies:
\[ T = S + 0.5S \]

Substitute the value of \( S \):
\[ T = 400 + 0.5 \times 400 \]
\[ T = 400 + 200 \]
\[ T = 600 \]

So, the total cost of the travel tickets is $600.

2. **Add the cost of supplies to the cost of travel tickets:**
   - Supply cost = $400
   - Travel ticket cost = $600

Total cost of travel:
\[ Total\ Cost = Supply\ Cost + Ticket\ Cost \]
\[ Total\ Cost = 400 + 600 \]
\[ Total\ Cost = 1000 \]

Therefore, the total cost of travel is **$1000**.<|im_end|>","He pays 400*.5=$<<400*.5=200>>200 more for tickets than supplies

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's define variables for the number of Pokémon each person has caught:

- Let \( A \) represent the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of Pokémon Adelwolde has caught.

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolde together is 339.
\[ A + S + W = 339 \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokémon than Stan.
\[ A = S + 5 \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less Pokémon than 4 times what Adelwolde has caught.
\[ S = 4W - 13 \]

Now we can substitute these expressions into the first equation to find the values of \( A \), \( S \), and \( W \).

First, substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into the total Pokémon equation:
\[ (S + 5) + S + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + 5 + W = 339 \]
\[ 2S + W = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

Next, substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into Equation 1:
\[ 2(4W - 13) + W = 334 \]
\[ 8W - 26 + W = 334 \]

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John will spend watching the entire series given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.

Let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of episodes:**
   - We know each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - Let \( n \) represent the number of episodes.
   - According to the problem, the number of episodes is half the number of minutes per episode.
     Therefore, \( n = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

2. **Calculate the total length of the show:**
   - Each episode is 20 minutes long.
   - There are 10 episodes.
   - The total length of the show is calculated by multiplying the number of episodes by the duration of each episode.
     Total length = \( 10 \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - John will spend 200 minutes watching the entire series.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To find the total distance traveled by the bird from its northern home to its southern home, we need to calculate the distances covered during each segment of the journey and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance covered during the first leg of the journey**
- The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 30 mph × 10 hours = 300 miles

**Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during the second leg of the journey**
- The bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 18 mph × 2 hours = 36 miles

**Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during the third leg of the journey**
- The bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance = 22 mph × 5 hours = 110 miles

**Step 4: Sum the distances from all three legs of the journey**
- Total distance = Distance (first leg) + Distance (second leg) + Distance (third leg)
- Total distance = 300 miles + 36 miles + 110 miles = 446 miles

Therefore, the total distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**.<|im_end|>","Flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour, the bird travels 10*30=<<10*30=300>>300 miles in a southerly direction.

And flying for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour, the bird travels 5*22=<<5*22=110>>110 miles in a southerly direction.
Altogether, the distance between the bird's two homes is 300-36+110=<<300-36+110=374>>374 miles

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Greta's initial batch**: 
   - She made a batch for herself.
   - Let's assume this batch was x brownies.

2. **Brownies at her office**:
   - She received half a dozen (6) brownies from her office.
   - So, after receiving these, she has: \(x + 6\).

3. **Brownies before the party**:
   - Her friends at the office gave her another dozen (12) brownies.
   - Therefore, she now has: \((x + 6) + 12 = x + 18\) brownies.

4. **Total number of brownies before the party**:
   - Before the party, she had a total of: \(x + 18\) brownies.

5. **Number of brownies during the party**:
   - During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - Since 1.5 dozen equals 18 brownies, she ate 18 more brownies.

6. **Final number of brownies after the party**:
   - After eating 18 brownies, she had: \(x + 18 - 18 = x\) brownies left.

7. **Adding brownies from the surprise party**:
   - The surprise party also added 4 dozen brownies.
   - So, she got an additional 4 dozen brownies, which is 4 * 12 = 48 brownies.
   - Therefore, she ends up having: \(x + 48\) brownies.

Since we know that she ended up with 90 brownies in total (after all additions), let's solve for x:

- We know that \(x + 48 = 90\).
- Solving for x gives us \(x = 90 - 48 = 42\).

So, Greta originally made 42 brownies for herself.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 42 brownies.<|im_end|>","Her office sent her home with a 1/2 dozen brownies so she had 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 individual brownies
Her friends had 4 dozen brownies and 1 1/2 dozen were eaten so 4-1.5 = <<4-1.5=2.5>>2.5 dozen brownies left
She made 1 dozen brownies and had 2.5 dozen left from the party so 1+2.5 = <<1+2.5=3.5>>3.5 dozen brownies
Every dozen is 12 and she has 3.5 dozen so she has 12*3.5 = <<12*3.5=42>>42 individuals brownies
She has 42 individual brownies plus the 6 individual brownies sent home from work so she has a total of 42+6 = <<42+6=48>>48 individual brownies

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Nani's Age**: 
   - We know that Nani is 8 years old.

2. **Brother's Age**:
   - The problem states that Nani's brother is twice his age.
   - Therefore, the brother's age = \( 2 \times Nani's age = 2 \times 8 = 16 \) years old.

3. **Nani's Sister's Age**:
   - Nani's sister is described as being 25% younger than Nani.
   - To find out how much younger she is, we calculate: \( 0.25 \times Nani's age = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \).
   - This means Nani's sister is 2 years younger than Nani.
   - Therefore, Nani's sister's age = \( Nani's age - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6 \) years old.

4. **Total Age Calculation**:
   - Now we add up the ages of all three family members:
     - Nani's age: 8 years
     - Brother's age: 16 years
     - Sister's age: 6 years
   - Total age = \( 8 + 16 + 6 = 20 \).

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 20 years. {The final answer is} 20.<|im_end|>","Nani's brother is 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 years old.
Nani's sister is 25/100 * 8 = <<25/100*8=2>>2 years younger than he is.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Andy spends on each type of stringing and then calculate the total time required.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of racquets for each type of string:**
   - Synthetic Gut: \(3\)
   - Polyester String: \(5\)
   - Hybrid Set: \(4\)

2. **Determine the time spent on each type of stringing:**
   - For synthetic gut: It takes Andy \(15\) minutes per racquet.
     \[
     \text{Time for synthetic gut} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - For polyester string: It takes Andy \(22\) minutes per racquet.
     \[
     \text{Time for polyester string} = 5 \times 22 = 110 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - For hybrid sets: It takes Andy \(18\) minutes per racquet.
     \[
     \text{Time for hybrid sets} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sum up the total time spent on all types of stringing:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is \(227\) minutes. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(\boxed{227}\) minutes.<|im_end|>","Andy is stringing 3 racquets with synthetic gut, so those will take 3 synthetic gut jobs * 15 minutes per synthetic gut job = <<3*15=45>>45 minutes.

He has 4 hybrid string jobs, so those will take 4 hybrid string jobs * 18 minutes per hybrid job = <<4*18=72>>72 minutes.
So Andy should finish stringing all the racquets in 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes = <<45+110+72=227>>227 minutes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying four iPhones (one for John himself and two for his kids, one for his wife). The pricing rule is that each subsequent iPhone costs half the original price.

1. **Calculate the price for the first iPhone:**
   - The original price of an iPhone is $600.
   - Since it's not mentioned if there's any discount on the first iPhone, we assume it's at full price.
   - Therefore, the price for the first iPhone = $600.

2. **Calculate the price for the second iPhone:**
   - According to the rule, the second iPhone will be half the price of the first iPhone.
   - Half of $600 is calculated as \( \frac{600}{2} = 300 \).
   - Therefore, the price for the second iPhone = $300.

3. **Calculate the price for the third iPhone:**
   - Similarly, the third iPhone will also be half the price of the second iPhone.
   - Half of $300 is calculated as \( \frac{300}{2} = 150 \).
   - Therefore, the price for the third iPhone = $150.

4. **Calculate the price for the fourth iPhone:**
   - The fourth iPhone will again be half the price of the third iPhone.
   - Half of $150 is calculated as \( \frac{150}{2} = 75 \).
   - Therefore, the price for the fourth iPhone = $75.

5. **Sum up the prices of all four iPhones:**
   - Total cost = Price of the first iPhone + Price of the second iPhone + Price of the third iPhone + Price of the fourth iPhone.
   - Total cost = $600 + $300 + $150 + $75 = $1125.

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the four iPhones is $1125.<|im_end|>","He bought 1+2+1=<<1+2+1=4>>4 phones

We know that Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. We also know that Carlton's team has 13 players.

So, if Carlton's team has 13 players, then Zeke's team will have \(13 + 7\) players.

Calculating this:
\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Therefore, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Step 2: Add the number of players from both teams together.

Now we add the number of players from both teams:

\[ 13 (Carlton's team) + 20 (Zeke's team) = 33 \]

To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need to build the fence, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (length + width)
     \]
   - Given the length (\( l \)) is 15 feet and the width (\( w \)) is 10 feet:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of wood slats needed:**
   - Robert requires 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing.
   - Therefore, if he needs 50 feet of fencing, the total number of wood slats required is:
     \[
     \text{Number of wood slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the 15-foot long, 10-foot wide rectangular wooden fence.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of boxes Mrs. Harrington initially bought.
Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes were given to her mom and her sister.
She gave 2 boxes to each of her mom and sister. Since there are two people (mom and sister), we multiply:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes/person} \times 2 \text{ persons} = 4 \text{ boxes} \]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of boxes given away from the initial total.
Subtracting the 4 boxes given away from the 12 boxes:
\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes remaining} \]

### Step 4: Find out what fraction of the remaining oranges Mrs. Harrington kept.
She kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining oranges. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 \text{ boxes} = 2 \text{ boxes} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of oranges in the boxes that were not sold.
Since each box contains 20 oranges, for 2 boxes:
\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 40 \text{ oranges} \]

### Conclusion:
Mrs. Harrington sold 40 oranges. Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many states there are in the USA.
2. Use that information to find out how many states India has based on the given condition.

Let's start with the first part:

Step 1: Find out how many states are in the USA.
- The United States (USA) has 50 states.

Now, let's move to the second part:

Step 2: Calculate the number of states in India based on the given condition.
- According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.
- Half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).
- Therefore, India has \( 25 + 4 = 29 \) states.

Finally, let's add up the total number of states in both countries together:

Total number of states = Number of states in USA + Number of states in India
= 50 + 29
= 79

Therefore, the total number of states in both India and the USA together is 79.<|im_end|>","Since the number of states in the USA is 50, half that number is 1/2*50 = 25
Since there are 4 more than half the number of states in the USA in India, there are 25+4 = <<4+25=29>>29 states in India.
Together, the two countries have 50+29 = <<50+29=79>>79 states.

To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford all his books, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books.
- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur Book: $13
- Children's Cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

### Step 2: Determine the amount Tyler still needs to save after saving his allowance.
Tyler has saved $14.

Amount needed = Total cost - Saved money
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

### Step 3: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to earn to cover the remaining amount.
Tyler earns $5 per hour.

Number of hours required = Amount needed / Earnings per hour
Number of hours required = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work **5** hours to afford his books.<|im_end|>","Tyler wants to purchase books that cost $18 + $13 + $8 = $<<18+13+8=39>>39.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherries each person has and then find out how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry.

Step 1: Determine how many cherries Richard has.
- We know that Robert has 30 cherries.
- According to the information given, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.
- Therefore, if Robert has 30 cherries, then Richard must have \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.

Step 2: Determine how many cherries Jerry has.
- The total number of cherries is 60.
- We already know that Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries.
- So, Jerry must have \(60 - (20 + 30) = 60 - 50 = 10\) cherries.

Step 3: Calculate how many more cherries Robert has compared to Jerry.
- Robert has 30 cherries.
- Jerry has 10 cherries.
- Therefore, Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{20}\).<|im_end|>","Since Robert has 30, then 60 - 30 = <<30=30>>30 cherries are left to be shared by Richard and Jerry.

To determine how much Sunny earned over two days, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of items sold on each day.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple Pie: \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \) boxes
- Apple Pie: 15 boxes

### Step 2: Calculate earnings from each item type on each day.

#### Gingerbread:
- Price per box: $6
- Total earnings from gingerbread on Saturday: \( 10 \times 6 = \$60 \)
- Total earnings from gingerbread on Sunday: \( 15 \times 6 = \$90 \)

Total earnings from gingerbread over both days:
\[ 60 + 90 = \$150 \]

- Price per box: $15
- Total earnings from apple pie on Saturday: \( 6 \times 15 = \$90 \)
- Total earnings from apple pie on Sunday: \( 15 \times 15 = \$225 \)

Total earnings from apple pie over both days:
\[ 90 + 225 = \$315 \]

### Step 3: Add up the total earnings from both items.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the total time Pam spends outside:**
   - She spends 4 hours outside per day.
   - Over 8 days, the total time spent outside is \(4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days}\).

2. **Calculate the total time Pam spends outside:**
   - Total time = \(4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Determine the amount of sunscreen Pam uses per hour:**
   - Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the cost of the red car.
- We know that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
- The blue car costs $100.

Let \( x \) be the cost of the red car.

Since the red car is 40% cheaper, we can express its cost as:
\[ x = 100 - 0.40 \times 100 \]

Step 2: Calculate the value of \( x \).
\[ x = 100 - (0.40 \times 100) \]
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

So, the red car costs $60.

Step 3: Find the total cost for both cars.
- The total cost will be the sum of the costs of the blue car and the red car.

Total cost = Cost of blue car + Cost of red car
\[ \text{Total cost} = 100 + 60 \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160.

Final Answer:
The final answer is: \(\boxed{160}\).<|im_end|>","The red car is 40/100 * 100 = $<<40/100*100=40>>40 cheaper than the blue car.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's father and brother based on the information provided about their ages when Emil turns 24.

### Step 1: Determine Emil's age at that future point in time.
Emil is currently 19 years old. He will turn 24 after 5 more years (since \(24 - 19 = 5\)).

### Step 2: Calculate the difference in age between Emil and his father when Emil is 24.
When Emil is 24, he will have been alive for \(24 - 19 = 5\) years longer than his father. This means that at that moment, his father will be \(5 \times 2 = 10\) years older than Emil.

### Step 3: Set up an equation representing the relationship between Emil's age and his father's age when Emil is 24.
Let \(E_d\) represent the current age of Emil's father, and \(B\) represent the current age of Emil's brother.

According to the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his father and twice the age of his brother. So we can write two equations:

1. \(24 = \frac{E_d}{2}\)
2. \(24 = 2B\)

From the second equation, we can find \(B\):
\[ B = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \]

Now substitute \(B = 12\) into the first equation to find \(E_d\):
\[ 24 = \frac{E_d}{2} \]
\[ E_d = 24 \times 2 = 48 \]

So, Emil’s father is currently 48 years old.

### Step 4: Sum the ages of Emil's father and brother.
Finally, let's calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's father and brother:
\[ E_d + B = 48 + 12 = 60 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's father and brother now is \(60\).

### Conclusion:
The final answer is \(\boxed{60}\).<|im_end|>","His dad will be 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 years old when Emil is 24.
His brother will be 24 / 2 = <<24/2=12>>12 years old then.

The age of his father now is 48 - 5= <<48-5=43>>43.
His brother is 12 - 5 = <<12-5=7>>7 years old right now.
The sum of his dad's and his brother's ages now is 43 + 7 = <<43+7=50>>50.

2. Calculate the number of beads given by Adrianne's sister.
3. Find out how many beads were given by Adrianne's friend.
4. Sum up all the beads from her mother, sister, and friend.

Step 1: Number of beads given by Adrianne's mother.
Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.

Step 2: Number of beads given by Adrianne's sister.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother. So, the calculation is:

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Joe's catch on Friday
- Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount.

\[
\text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Joe's catch on Saturday
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch.

\[
\text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total catch over the three days
- Total catch (Thursday + Friday + Saturday) = \(3 \text{ pounds} + 12 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds}\)

\[
\text{Total catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}

### Step 4: Determine the number of servings based on the serving size
- One serving is defined as 3 pounds.

\[
\text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{serving size}} = \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of servings} = 7 \text{ servings}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
2. Calculate the total size of both boots combined.
3. Find the average size of the shoes.

Step 1: Determine the size of Charlie's boots.
Charlie's boots are described as ""five times the size of Sophie's"". Since Sophie's boots are size 5, we multiply this by 5 to find Charlie's size.
Size of Charlie's boots = 5 × 5 = 25

Step 2: Calculate the total size of both boots combined.
Now that we know the sizes of both boots, we add them together.
Total size = Size of Sophie's boots + Size of Charlie's boots
Total size = 5 + 25 = 30

Step 3: Find the average size of the shoes.
To find the average size of the shoes worn by both people, we divide the total size by 2 (since there are two people).
Average size = Total size ÷ 2
Average size = 30 ÷ 2 = 15

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by the two people is 15.

                    question:
                    Pat has a flower bed that is 111 feet long.  Pat wants to fill her flower bed with plants.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide so she needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much money Pat will spend on the flowers, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flowers needed.
Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. The width of each flower should be 12 inches (or 1 foot) for the gaps between them.

First, convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches:
\[ 111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches} \]

Now, divide this total length by the space required per flower plus the gap between them:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/flower} + 1.5 \text{ feet}} \]

Convert 1.5 feet to inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 18 \text{ inches} \]

Add the two values together:
\[ 12 \text{ inches/flower} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches} \]

Divide the total length by 30 inches:
\[ \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/flower}} = 44.4 \]

Since Pat can't buy a fraction of a flower, round up to the nearest whole number:
\[ \lceil 44.4 \rceil = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 flowers to cover the entire length of her flower bed.

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the flowers.
Each flower costs $6. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 45 \text{ flowers} \times \$6/\text{flower} = \$270 \]

Thus, the amount Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:
\[
\boxed{\$270}
\]<|im_end|>","Pat's flower bed is 111 feet / 1.5 feet per plant = <<111/1.5=74>>74 plants needed.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day**

- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- His brother eats half as many as Edgar.

So, we calculate the number of pretzels his brother eats per day:
\[ \text{Brother's daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 \]

\[
= 9 \text{ pretzels/day}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week**

There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily amount by 7 to find out how many he eats in a week:
\[ \text{Brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 \]

\[
= 63 \text{ pretzels/week}
\]

Therefore, his brother eats **63 pretzels** in a week.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many pairs of fancy shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jessica's monthly savings:**
   - Jessica saves 25% of her $2,000 salary.
   \[
   \text{Monthly Savings} = 25\% \times \$2,000 = 0.25 \times \$2,000 = \$500
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per shoe:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.

3. **Calculate the number of shoes Jessica can buy each month:**
   - Divide the total amount saved each month by the cost of one shoe.
   \[
   \text{Number of Shoes per Month} = \frac{\$500}{\$1,000} = 0.5 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Since Jessica cannot purchase half a shoe, this calculation indicates that she can only buy whole pairs of shoes.

4. **Convert months into years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   \[
   \text{Total Years} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{0.5 \text{ shoes/month}} = 24 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy **24 pairs of fancy shoes** in a year.<|im_end|>","She is paid $2,000.00 a month and she saves 25% for shoes so she saves 2000*.25 = $<<2000*.25=500.00>>500.00

                    question:
                    Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long . will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the time required to peel shrimp.
Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. We need to find out how many shrimp she can peel in total.

- Number of shrimp peeled per minute = 6
- Total number of shrimp needed = 90

Time (in minutes) to peel all shrimp = \(\frac{Total number of shrimp}{Number of shrimp peeled per minute}\)

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

So far, we have calculated that it takes 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

### Step 2: Calculate the time required to sauté shrimp.
We know that Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.

- Time to sauté shrimp = 10 minutes
- Number of shrimp needed = 30

Now, calculate the rate at which she can sauté shrimp:

- Rate of sautéing shrimp per minute = \(\frac{30}{10} = 3\) shrimp per minute

Next, determine the time required to sauté all 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{Total number of shrimp}{Rate of sautéing shrimp per minute}
\]

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it takes 30 minutes to sauté all 90 shrimp.

### Step 3: Combine both times.
To find the total time required to both peel and sauté the shrimp, add the time for peeling and the time for sautéing:

\[
\text{Total time} = Time to peel + Time to sauté
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
It will take Emily **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.<|im_end|>","First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes

Then multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes
Then add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break down the cooling process step by step.

1. **Initial Cooling (Low Mode)**
   - The air conditioner runs on low mode.
   - It cools the room at 2 degrees per hour.
   - For 3 hours: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) degrees cooler.
   
2. **High Mode Cooling**
   - Now, the air conditioner switches to high mode.
   - It cools the room at 3 degrees per hour.
   - For 4 hours: \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) degrees cooler.
   
3. **Cooling During Off Time**
   - The air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.
   - No cooling occurs during this time.

Now, let's calculate the total cooling effect:

- Initial cooling: 6 degrees
- High mode cooling: 12 degrees
- Total cooling: \( 6 + 12 = 18 \) degrees

Since the initial room temperature is not specified, we assume the room starts at its normal temperature.

After these operations, the room has cooled down to 18 degrees below its original temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature in the room is 18 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

{The final answer is} 18<|im_end|>","The air conditioner ran for 3 hours on low, so the temperature dropped 2 * 3 = <<3*2=6>>6 degrees.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Bill's age when he saw the comet for the second time:**
   - Bill saw the comet again when he was three times the age of his dad.
   - Let \( B \) be Bill's current age.
   - His dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.

2. **Calculate the age difference between Bill and his dad:**
   - The age difference between them is \( B - 30 \).

3. **Relate the age difference to the number of comets seen:**
   - Bill sees the comet every 75 years.
   - If Bill sees the comet twice (as mentioned in the problem), then the total time elapsed is \( 2 \times 75 = 150 \) years.

4. **Set up the equation based on the age difference:**
   - Since the age difference must equal the number of comets seen multiplied by the interval between comets,
   - We have \( B - 30 = \frac{150}{75} \).

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   - \( \frac{150}{75} = 2 \).
   - So, \( B - 30 = 2 \).

6. **Solve for Bill's current age:**
   - Add 30 to both sides of the equation: \( B = 2 + 30 \).
   - Therefore, \( B = 32 \).

So, Bill is currently 32 years old.

The final answer is:
\[

To determine how many checks Buford writes in a year, we need to consider all his monthly and quarterly activities.

1. **Electric Bill Checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the electric bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of electric bills written in a year is \(1 \times 12 = 12\).

2. **Gas Bill Checks:**
   - Buford writes one check per month for the gas bill.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of gas bills written in a year is \(1 \times 12 = 12\).

3. **Church Checks:**
   - Buford writes two checks per month for the church.
   - There are 4 quarters (each quarter has 3 months) in a year.
   - Since there are four quarters, the total number of church checks written in a year is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check:**
   - Buford writes one check per quarter for the pest and lawn service.
   - There are 4 quarters in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pest and lawn service checks written in a year is \(1 \times 4 = 4\).

Now, let's add up all these checks:

- Electric bills: 12
- Gas bills: 12
- Church checks: 8
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total number of checks per year:
\[12 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 36\]

   - Since the first plane has three-quarters of its flights to Greece, the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
     Therefore, the number of flights not going to Greece = \( T - \frac{3}{4}T = \frac{1}{4}T \).
   - These flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
     So, the number of flights to France = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}T = \frac{1}{8}T \).

4. **Verify the information about the second plane:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and has 44 trips.
     So, \( T = 44 \).

5. **Find the value of \( T \):**
   - We already know from step 4 that \( T = 44 \).

6. **Substitute \( T \) back into the equation for flights to France:**
   - From step 3, we have \( \text{flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}T \).
   - Substitute \( T = 44 \):
     \[
     \text{flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 44 = 5.5
     \]

Therefore, the first plane takes 5.5 flights to France in one day.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","The second plane flies half as much as the first, so the first plane makes 44 flights * 2 = <<44*2=88>>88 flights a day.
If 3/4 of the first plane’s flights are to Greece, then flights to France or Germany make up 1 – 3/4 = 1/4 of the total daily flights.
Therefore, 88 daily flights / 4 = <<88/4=22>>22 flights to France or Germany.
Splitting these flights equally means the first plane makes 22 flights / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 flights to France in one day.

                    question:
                    Tobias, ! Chikote, and Igneous are the three little wolves who live in the forest and howl at the moon every night. When Tobias ? howls, each howl lasts for a total of 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.  And Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  What is the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how long Tobias' howls last:**
   - Tobias' howl duration = 20 seconds.

2. **Calculate Chikote's howl duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration = 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

3. **Find the combined howl duration of Tobias and Chikote:**
   - Combined duration (Tobias + Chikote) = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds.

4. **Calculate Igneous' howl duration:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Since we already know that the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote is 60 seconds, Igneous' howl duration = 60 seconds.

5. **Add up all the durations to find the total howl time:**
   - Total howl time = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
   - Total howl time = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds.

6. **Convert the total howl time from seconds to minutes:**
   - To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute).
   - Total howl time in minutes = 120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.<|im_end|>","Chikote howls for 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 seconds.
Igneous howls for 20+40=<<20+40=60>>60 seconds.
In total, the combined length of time, in seconds, of the three wolves' howls is 20+40+60=<<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.
Thus, the combined length of time, in minutes, of the three wolves' howls is 120/60=<<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Adam's initial purchase:**
   - Adam buys trousers for $30.
   
2. **Money given by Adam's mother:**
   - Adam receives an additional $6 from his mother.
   
3. **Money given by Adam's father:**
   - Adam's father gives him twice as much as his mother. Since his mother gave him $6, his father gives him \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Total amount received:**
   - The total amount of money Adam has now includes what he spent on the trousers and what he received from both his parents.
     \[
     \text{Total} = \$30 (\text{spent}) + \$6 (\text{from mother}) + \$12 (\text{from father})

5. **Amount contributed by Adam’s savings:**
   - To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount he received from the total amount he has now.
     \[
     \text{Contributed Savings} = \$58 (\text{total}) - \$30 (\text{spent})

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all four children based on the given information.

1. **Identify the total age of the children:**
   The total age of the children is given as 20 years.

2. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Akbar and Alessandro:**
   - Akbar is 3 years old.
   - Alessandro is 4 years old.
   - Their combined age is \(3 + 4 = 7\) years.

3. **Subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total age:**
   \[
   20 - (3 + 4) = 20 - 7 = 13
   \]
   This means the total age of Wilfred and Helene must be 13 years.

4. **Set up an equation for the average age of the group:**
   Let \(A\) represent the average age of the group.
   \[
   A = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

5. **Use the relationship between Helene's age and the average age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
   \[
   H = 2A = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

6. **Calculate Helene's age:**
   \[
   H = 10
   \]

7. **Determine Wilfred's age:**
   Since the total age of Wilfred and Helene is 13 years, and Helene is 10 years old, Wilfred's age can be found by subtracting Helene's age from the total.
   \[
   W = 13 - H = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

Therefore, the age of Wilfred is 3 years old.

**Final Answer:** 
\[
\boxed{\text{Wilfred is 3 years old}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate total collected so far:**
   - From neighbors: $500
   - From fund online: $1500
   Total collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

2. **Determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate based on the total collected amount:**
   The lawyer offers to donate ""three times as much as everyone else donates.""

3. **Find out how much everyone else has donated:**
   Since we only know what Walter has collected ($2000), we need to assume that the remaining amount must be distributed among himself (the lawyer) and the people who gave the initial donations.

4. **Let x represent the total donation amount given by the lawyer:**
   - According to the problem, the lawyer's donation should be 3x.
   
5. **Set up an equation representing the total collection including the lawyer’s contribution:**
   \[
   2000 + x = 3x
   \]

6. **Solve for x:**
   Subtract x from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2000 = 2x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 1000
   \]

7. **Verify if the solution makes sense in context:**
   If \( x = 1000 \), then the lawyer would have contributed $1000, which fits our assumption since it's three times the amount donated by Walter.

8. **Calculate the total donation amount from the lawyer:**
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's Contribution} = 3 \times 1000 = 3000

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies at the wedding**

- There were 100 guests.
- Each guest brought a plate containing 15 cookies.

Total number of cookies = Number of guests * Cookies per guest
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 100 \times 15 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Determine half of the total cookies that need to be given to the church**

Half of the cookies = Total cookies / 2
\[ \text{Cookies for church} = 1500 / 2 = 750 \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many people can receive 15 cookies from the church**

Each person receiving cookies gets 15 cookies. To find out how many people can get 15 cookies each, divide the total cookies available by the number of cookies per person.

Number of people = Total cookies for church / Cookies per person

                    question:
                    A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as . that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( V \) be the total volume of the watermelon.

2. **Determine Adult Slice Volume:**
   Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice. Let \( S_k \) represent the volume of a kid's slice. Therefore, an adult's slice will be \( 2S_k \).

3. **Total Number of Slices:**
   There are 2 adults and 4 kids, so there are \( 2 + 4 = 6 \) slices in total.

4. **Sum of All Slice Volumes:**
   The sum of all slice volumes should equal the total volume of the watermelon. Thus,
   \[
   6S_a + 6S_k = V
   \]
   where \( S_a \) represents the volume of an adult's slice.

5. **Express Adult Slice Volume in Terms of Kid's Slice:**
   Since each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can write:
   \[
   S_a = 2S_k
   \]

6. **Substitute into Total Slice Volume Equation:**
   Substitute \( S_a = 2S_k \) into the equation \( 6S_a + 6S_k = V \):
   \[
   6(2S_k) + 6S_k = V
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   12S_k + 6S_k = V
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   18S_k = V
   \]

7. **Find the Fraction of Watermelon per Slice:**
   Now, find the fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult has two slices, the fraction for each adult’s share is:
   \[
   \frac{S_a}{V} = \frac{2S_k}{18S_k}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{2S_k}{18S_k} = \frac{2}{18} = \frac{1}{9}
   \]

8. **Convert Fraction to Percentage:**
   To convert this fraction to a percentage, multiply by 100%:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{9}\right) \times 100\% \approx 11.11\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
Each adult gets approximately **11.11%** of the watermelon.<|im_end|>","Let x be the percentage of watermelon that each adult gets.
Since each kid gets half of what each adult gets, each kid gets x/2 percent of the watermelon
So the watermelon gets split into 2*x and 4*(x/2) parts by percentage

x = 100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25, which means each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

   - There are 9 patients.
   - Total time spent on rounds = \(9 \times 20\) minutes.

2. **Convert the total time spent on rounds from minutes to hours**:
   - \(9 \times 20 = 180\) minutes.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, \(180\) minutes is equivalent to \(3\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total time spent on appointments**:
   - Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
   - There are 10 appointments.
   - Total time spent on appointments = \(10 \times 30\) minutes.

4. **Convert the total time spent on appointments from minutes to hours**:

5. **Sum up all the times (rounds + appointments)**:
   - Total time spent on rounds: \(3\) hours.
   - Total time spent on appointments: \(5\) hours.
   - Combined total time spent: \(3 + 5 = 8\) hours.

6. **Subtract the combined total time spent from the total available working hours**:
   - Total available working hours: 9 hours.

To determine the latest time Jordan should start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for each stage and then work backwards from the desired serving time.

1. **Total Time Required**:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in one box given that Lisa and Peter together sold 64 chocolate bars.

Step 1: Convert the number of boxes Lisa and Peter sold into an equivalent amount.
Lisa sold 3.5 boxes.
Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

Step 2: Add the number of boxes they sold together.
\[ 3.5 \text{ (Lisa's boxes)} + 4.5 \text{ (Peter's boxes)} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars sold.
They sold a total of 64 chocolate bars.

Step 4: Determine the number of chocolate bars per box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.
\[ \frac{64 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ boxes}} = 8 \text{ chocolate bars per box} \]

Therefore, there are **8 chocolate bars** in a box.<|im_end|>","Let B stand for the number of chocolate bars in a box.
Lisa sold 3 1/2 * B bars.
Peter sold 4 1/2 * B bars.
Together, they sold 3 1/2 * B + 4 1/2 * B = 8B = 64 bars.
Therefore, there are B = 64 / 8 = <<64/8=8>>8 chocolate bars in a box.

                    question:
                    A dance studio offers lessons to students. It costs $25 per session . to rent the studio plus $1.50 per student per session. At present, the dance studio has ! 10 students , and is . rented 3 days a week. How much are the expected earnings of , the dance studio in a month?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of renting the studio for one day
- The studio rents for $25 per session.
- They are renting the studio **3** times a week.

\[ \text{Cost per day} = \$25 \times 3 = \$75 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sessions per week
- There are **10** students at any given time.
- Each student attends **1** session per week.

\[ \text{Total sessions per week} = 10 \times 1 = 10 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the weekly rental cost
- We already calculated that the studio rents for $75 per day.
- Therefore, the weekly rental cost is also $75 (since they rent 3 days a week).

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from the dance classes
- Let \( x \) be the number of students attending on any given day.
- Since there are 10 students always attending, we can consider \( x \) as representing the number of new students added daily.

Given that the studio has 10 students always attending, if \( x \) represents additional students, then the total number of students per day would be \( 10 + x \).

Since each student pays $25 per session, and assuming all students attend only once per week, the total amount collected from these students is:

\[ \text{Revenue from students} = (\text{Number of students}) \times \$25 \]
\[ \text{Revenue from students} = (10 + x) \times \$25 \]

Let’s assume \( x \) students attend each day; hence the total number of students attending on any given day is \( 10 + x \). 

Thus, the total revenue from students over 3 days is:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 3 \times (10 + x) \times \$25 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total weekly revenue
Now, we need to add the revenue from students to the rental cost.

\[ \text{Total Weekly Revenue} = \$75 \text{(rental)} + [3 \times (10 + x) \times \$25] \]

### Step 6: Calculate monthly revenue
Since we want the total earnings for the entire month, we multiply the weekly revenue by the number of weeks in a month.

Assuming a month consists of **4 weeks**, the monthly revenue will be:

\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = \text{Total Weekly Revenue} \times 4 \]

### Final Calculation:
Let’s plug in some numbers to illustrate the calculation more concretely. Suppose \( x = 2 \) (i.e., 2 extra students attend each day):

\[ \text{Total Number of Students per Day} = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue from Students} = 12 \times \$25 = \$300 \]

\[ \text{Rental Cost} = \$75 \times 3 = \$225 \]

\[ \text{Total Weekly Revenue} = \$300 + \$225 = \$525 \]

\[ \text{Monthly Earnings} = \$525 \times 4 = \$2100 \]

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month would be $\boxed{\$2100}$.<|im_end|>","The total earnings from 10 students is $1.50 x 10 = $<<1.50*10=15>>15 per session.
So the total earnings per session is $15 + $25 = $<<15+25=40>>40.
Thus, every week the dance studio earns $40 x 3 = $<<40*3=120>>120.
Therefore, it will earn $120 x 4 = $<<120*4=480>>480 in a month.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars per box for both Peter and Martha:**

   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box.
   
2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes, so he has \( 4x \) chocolate bars in total.
   - Martha has 7 boxes, so she has \( 7x \) chocolate bars in total.

3. **Use the provided total numbers of chocolate bars:**
   - Peter's total = 64 chocolate bars, so \( 4x = 64 \).
   - Martha's total = 56 chocolate bars, so \( 7x = 56 \).

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - For Peter: 
     \[
     4x = 64 \\
     x = \frac{64}{4} \\
     x = 16
     \]
   - For Martha:
     \[
     7x = 56 \\
     x = \frac{56}{7} \\
     x = 8
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check if \( x = 16 \) works for both cases:
     - Peter: \( 4 \times 16 = 64 \)
     - Martha: \( 7 \times 8 = 56 \)

   Both calculations confirm that \( x = 16 \).

6. **Calculate the difference between the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter and Martha:**
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Peter: 16
   - Number of chocolate bars per box for Martha: 8
   
   Difference:
   \[
   16 - 8 = 8
   \]

Therefore, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars per box than Martha. 

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 8.<|im_end|>","Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 equal boxes so there are 64/4 = <<64/4=16>>16 bars in each box

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the number of female porcupines:**
   - We know that the total population of porcupines is 50.
   - The number of female porcupines is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the total population.
   
   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the monthly birth rate for female porcupines:**
   - Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.

3. **Calculate the annual birth rate for all female porcupines:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly birth rate by 12.
   \[
   \text{Annual birth rate} = 4 \times 12 = 48
   \]
   - This means that 48 new female porcupines are born annually.

4. **Calculate the number of female porcupines at the end of the year:**
   - Start with the initial number of female porcupines (30).
   - Add the annual increase due to births (48).

   \[
   \text{Total female porcupines at the end of the year} = 30 + 48 = 78
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of porcupines at the end of the year:**
   - The total number of porcupines includes both male and female porcupines.
   - Given that the total population initially is 50, and assuming males do not give birth, we only consider females for the calculation.

   \[
   \text{Total porcupines at the end of the year} = 78 \text{ (female porcupines)}

How much will it cost to fill the pool?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of filling the pool, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool**

- **Length (L) = 25 feet**
- **Width (W) = 14 feet**
- **Depth (D) = 4 feet**

The formula to calculate the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is our pool) is:
\[ V = L \times W \times D \]

Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[ V = 25 \text{ ft} \times 14 \text{ ft} \times 4 \text{ ft} \]
\[ V = 350 \text{ cubic feet} \]

**Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons**

We know that 1 cubic foot equals approximately 7.48096 gallons.

So, convert the volume in cubic feet to gallons:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = V \times 7.48096 \]

Substitute the volume calculated earlier:
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 350 \text{ cubic feet} \times 7.48096 \]
\[ \text{Volume in gallons} = 2578.236 \text{ gallons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost to fill the pool**

Given that the cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, we can now calculate the total cost.
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 2578.236 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.10/\text{gallon} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$257.8236 \]

Therefore, the total cost to fill the pool is approximately $257.82.

**Final Answer: The final answer is:** $257.82.<|im_end|>","Mr. Smith found the volume of the pool to be 14 feet wide x 25 feet long x 4 feet deep = <<14*25*4=1400>>1,400 cubic feet

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 9 red sticks.
   - There are 5 more blue sticks than red.
   - The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.

2. **Calculate the number of blue sticks:**
   - Since there are 5 more blue sticks than red, we can calculate the number of blue sticks as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue sticks} = \text{Number of red sticks} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
     \]

3. **Verify the number of blue sticks:**
   - We need to check if the number of blue sticks (14) satisfies the condition that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks.
   - Calculate the number of yellow sticks:
     \[
     \text{Number of yellow sticks} = \text{Number of blue sticks} - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11
     \]
   - This confirms our calculation since the number of yellow sticks should be 11, not 3 less than the blue sticks.

4. **Summarize the total number of sticks:**
   - Red sticks: 9
   - Blue sticks: 14
   - Yellow sticks: 11
   - Total number of sticks = Red + Blue + Yellow = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

To determine how much farther Shandy drove compared to Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, let's calculate the distance Matteo traveled.

Matteo's speed: \( 55 \) miles/hour
Matteo's time: \( 4 \) hours

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles}

Next, let's calculate the distance Shandy traveled.

Shandy's speed: \( 45 \) miles/hour
Shandy's time: \( 10 \) hours

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles}

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled by Shandy and Matteo.

\[
\text{Difference in Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in Distance} = 450 \text{ miles} - 220 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of students over 16 years old**
- Total number of students = 3000
- Half of these students are over 16 years old.
\[ \text{Number of students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of males among those over 16 years old**
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
\[ \text{Number of males over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375 \]

**Step 3: Find the number of females among those over 16 years old**
- Remaining students after accounting for males over 16 years old.
\[ \text{Remaining students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125 \]
- Since half of the students under 16 are male, the other half must be female.
\[ \text{Number of females over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1125 = 562.5 \]
Since we cannot have half a student, let's round to the nearest whole number if necessary.

**Step 4: Determine the number of students under 16 years old**
- Total number of students minus those over 16 years old.
\[ \text{Number of students under 16} = 3000 - 1500 = 1500 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the number of males among those under 16 years old**
- Half of the students under 16 years old are male.
\[ \text{Number of males under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \]

**Step 6: Find the number of females among those under 16 years old**
- Remaining students after accounting for males under 16 years old.
\[ \text{Remaining students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750 \]
- Since half of the students under 16 are male, the other half must be female.
\[ \text{Number of females under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 750 = 375 \]

**Step 7: Sum up all the female students**
- Female students from those over 16 years old + Female students from those under 16 years old.
\[ \text{Total female students} = 562.5 + 375 = 937.5 \]
Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 938.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many gallons of water remain for the tank to be full, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day.
2. Determine the amount of water left after the first day.
3. Calculate the amount of water pumped on the second day.
4. Determine the amount of water left after the second day.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Day 1:**
- **Wanda’s Contribution:** 
  - She fills \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
  - The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.
  - Therefore, Wanda pumps \( \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \) gallons.

- **Ms. B’s Contribution:**
  - She pumps \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda did.
  - Since Wanda pumped 4500 gallons, Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \) gallons.

- Total Water Pumped on Day 1: 
  - \( 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \) gallons.

**Day 2:**
- **Wanda’s Contribution:**
  - She pumps \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  - Since Wanda pumped 4500 gallons on the first day, she will pump \( \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \) gallons.

- **Ms. B’s Contribution:**
  - She pumps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  - Since Ms. B pumped 3375 gallons on the first day, she will pump \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \) gallons.

- Total Water Pumped on Day 2: 
  - \( 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \) gallons.

**Remaining Water Needed:**
- Initially, the tank was empty.
- After the first day, the tank had 7875 gallons of water.
- After the second day, the tank had \( 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \) gallons of water.

Since the tank can hold up to 18000 gallons, the remaining water needed to fill the tank is:
\[ 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \] gallons.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 6000 gallons.<|im_end|>","On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4*18000 gallons = <<1/4*18000=4500>>4500 gallons of water.
On the same day, Ms. B pumped 3/4*4500 gallons = <<3/4*4500=3375>>3375 gallons of water into the tank.
They pumped a total of 3375 gallons+ 4500 gallons = <<3375+4500=7875>>7875 gallons together on the first day
On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 * 4500 gallons = <<2/3*4500=3000>>3000 gallons
Ms. B also pumped 3375 gallons * 1/3 = <<3375*1/3=1125>>1125 gallons
Together, on the second day, they pumped 3000 gallons + 1125 gallons = <<3000+1125=4125>>4125 gallons
In the two days, they pumped a total of 4125 gallons + 7875 gallons = <<4125+7875=12000>>12000 gallons
The amount of gallons remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = <<18000-12000=6000>>6000 gallons

                    question:
                    Maria was charging her power bank before going to the ; park when she disconnected , it and noticed , the power bank wasn’t fully charged yet. Once , at the park, her friends asked her if ? they could charge their phones.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much charge remains in Maria's power bank based on the given conditions.

1. **Initial Charge Calculation:**
   - Let \( C \) be the initial amount of charge in the power bank.
   - The power bank loses 9% of its charge every hour for 5 hours initially. So, after 5 hours, the charge left would be \( C - 0.09C = 0.91C \).

2. **Charge After 5 Hours Loss:**
   - After 5 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so \( 0.91C = 0.28C \). Solving for \( C \), we get \( C = \frac{0.28}{0.91} \approx 0.3064 \times C \).

3. **Additional Charge Lost:**
   - For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its remaining charge. Since it already has 28% of its original charge, let's denote this new charge as \( x \).
   - After 3 more hours, the charge lost will be \( x - 0.07x = 0.93x \).
   - We know that after these additional 3 hours, the charge left should be zero because all the remaining charge must have been used up.

4. **Equating Remaining Charges:**
   - At the start, the charge left was 28% of the initial charge \( C \), which is \( 0.28C \).
   - After the first 5 hours, the charge left is \( 0.91C \).
   - After the additional 3 hours, the charge left is \( 0.93 \times (0.91C) \).

Since the charge left after the last period equals zero, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.93 \times 0.91C = 0 \]

Solving this equation gives us:

\[ 0.8453C = 0 \]

From this, we see that \( C = 0 \).

Therefore, the charge remaining in the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 0%.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","At first, the power bank lost 9% per hour * 5 hours = 45%.
Later on, the power bank lost 7% per hour * 3 hours = 21%.
The power bank charge remaining was 28%, so the power bank charge before going to the park was 45 + 21 +28 = 94%.

                    question:
                    Janet gets a job as a ; waitress.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  , She wants to save . up 20% of the cost of a $10000 car for a downpayment.  If she works 40 hours a week how many weeks will she need to work ? to save the down payment?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save enough for a down payment on a $10,000 car at 20%, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janet earns per hour.
Janet's wage is $10/hour.

### Step 2: Calculate her hourly earnings from tips.
Her tips are $15/hour.

### Step 3: Determine her total earnings per hour.
Total earnings = Wage + Tips
                = $10/hour (wage) + $15/hour (tips)
                = $25/hour

### Step 4: Calculate the total savings Janet aims to achieve.
She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car.
Cost of the car = $10,000
Savings goal = 20% of $10,000
                  = 0.20 × $10,000
                  = $2,000

### Step 5: Determine how much she needs to earn in one week.
Since she works 40 hours a week, we calculate her weekly earnings:
Weekly earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked
                 = $25/hour × 40 hours
                 = $1,000/week

### Step 6: Calculate the number of weeks needed to reach her savings goal.
Number of weeks required = Total savings needed / Weekly earnings
                        = $2,000 / $1,000/week
                        = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet will need to work **2 weeks** to save enough for a down payment on a $10,000 car.<|im_end|>","She makes 10+15=$<<10+15=25>>25 an hour from working

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent on fruits already purchased.
- **Peaches**: 3 peaches at $0.5 per peach = \(3 \times 0.5 = \$1.5\)
- **Pears**: 4 pears at $0.5 per pear = \(4 \times 0.5 = \$2.0\)
- **Kiwi**: 2 kiwis at $1 per kiwi = \(2 \times 1 = \$2.0\)

Total spent on these fruits so far:
\[ 1.5 + 2.0 + 2.0 = \$5.5 \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jamaar still has left after purchasing these fruits.
Jamaar started with $10, so his remaining money is:
\[ 10 - 5.5 = \$4.5 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the remaining fruits (apples).
- **Apples**: 5 apples at $0.75 each = \(5 \times 0.75 = \$3.75\)

### Step 4: Subtract the cost of the apples from the remaining funds.
Remaining money after buying apples:
\[ 4.5 - 3.75 = \$0.75 \]

### Step 5: Determine how many plums Jamaar can purchase with the remaining money.
Plums cost $0.25 each.

Number of plums he can buy:
\[ \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Jamaar can buy **3 plums** with the remaining money.<|im_end|>","He has spent $3.5 on peaches and pears because 7 x .5 = <<7*.5=3.5>>3.5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of packs Anne had.
Anne bought a box containing 15 packs.

### Step 2: Calculate how many packs Anne kept for herself.
Anne kept 2 packs for herself.

### Step 3: Find out how many packs were given to her friends.
She gave away \( 15 - 2 = 13 \) packs to her friends.

### Step 4: Determine how many friends received the sweets.
Anne has 10 friends.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of sweets each friend receives.
Each friend gets an equal share of the remaining sweets after giving 13 packs to friends.

First, calculate the total number of sweets in the box:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, subtract the 13 packs she keeps for herself from the total:
\[ 900 \text{ pieces} - 13 \text{ packs} = 877 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, divide these sweets equally among the 10 friends:
\[ \frac{877 \text{ pieces}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 87.7 \text{ pieces/friend} \]

Therefore, each friend receives approximately **87.7** pieces of sweets. Since we can't have a fraction of a sweet piece, we need to round or consider practical scenarios (like cutting sweets). However, if we strictly follow the calculation without rounding, each friend would get exactly **87.7** pieces. If we want whole pieces, we might need to adjust our approach or consider fractional sweets. 

Given the context of typical candy distribution problems, it's likely that the problem intends for us to work with whole numbers, so we'll proceed with the exact division as calculated above. 

However, since the problem asks for ""each friend"", and considering practicality, we should state that each friend receives **87.7** pieces, but in a real-world scenario, we'd round up or down based on actual candy sizes. For simplicity here, we will present the result as is:

The final answer is: Each friend receives **87.7** pieces of sweets.<|im_end|>","After Anne kept 2 packs, there were only 15 - 2 = <<15-2=13>>13 packs left.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the price of carrots after three years, given an annual increase rate of 5%. We will use the formula for compound interest to find the future value.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Initial Value and Rate:**
   - Initial price of carrots = $120
   - Annual increase rate = 5% or 0.05 as a decimal

2. **Calculate Price After One Year:**
   The price after one year can be calculated using the formula for compound interest.
   
   \[
   P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + r)
   \]
   
   Where \(P_1\) is the price after one year, \(P_0\) is the initial price, and \(r\) is the annual increase rate.
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   P_1 = 120 \times (1 + 0.05) = 120 \times 1.05 = 126
   \]

3. **Calculate Price After Two Years:**
   Now, take the new price from the first calculation and apply the same formula again.
   
   \[
   P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + r)
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   P_2 = 126 \times (1 + 0.05) = 126 \times 1.05 = 132.30
   \]

4. **Calculate Price After Three Years:**
   Finally, apply the formula once more with the new price from the second calculation.
   
   \[
   P_3 = P_2 \times (1 + r)
   \]
   
   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   P_3 = 132.30 \times (1 + 0.05) = 132.30 \times 1.05 = 139.815
   \]

### Final Answer:
After rounding to the nearest integer, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $140. Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} $140.<|im_end|>","In the first year, the price of carrots increases by 5/100*120 = $<<5/100*120=6>>6

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total Pictures Uploaded**: Olivia has uploaded 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums Used**: Olivia used 8 albums.

3. **Selfies in Albums**:
   - We know that 3 out of the 8 albums contain selfies.
   - Therefore, the number of albums containing selfies = 3.

4. **Portraits in Albums**:
   - The remaining albums (after accounting for the selfies) must be portraits.
   - Total albums - Selfies = Portraits
   - 8 - 3 = 5 albums are portraits.

5. **Calculating Portraits and Selfies**:
   - Let \( P \) represent the total number of portraits.
   - Let \( S \) represent the total number of selfies.
   
6. **Sum of Portraits and Selfies**:
   - Since all albums are either portraits or selfies, we can write:
     \[
     P + S = 72
     \]

7. **Substituting Known Values**:
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     P + S = 72
     \]
     \[
     P = 5 \quad (\text{since } 5 \text{ albums are portraits})
     \]
     \[
     S = 3 \quad (\text{since } 3 \text{ albums are selfies})
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Olivia had 5 portraits and 3 selfies.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} Olivia had 5 portraits and 3 selfies.<|im_end|>","Olivia had 72 pictures / 8 albums = <<72/8=9>>9 picture per album.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time James spends reading given that he has already spent some time reading earlier.

Step 1: Determine the rate at which James reads.
- We know that James can read 3 pages in 10 minutes.
- Therefore, his reading speed (pages per minute) is \( \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \) pages per minute.

Step 2: Calculate how many more pages James needs to read.
- James has already read 3 pages.
- He plans to read an additional 18 pages.
- So, he still needs to read \( 18 - 3 = 15 \) pages.

Step 3: Calculate the total reading time for the remaining pages.
- Since James's reading speed is 0.3 pages per minute, it will take him \( \frac{15}{0.3} = 50 \) minutes to read the remaining 15 pages.

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is the sum of the time he has already spent plus the time left to read.

Final Answer:
James spends a total of 60 minutes reading. This is because the initial 10 minutes he took to read 3 pages was part of his planned reading session, so he only spent 10 minutes on this task. The remaining 50 minutes were added to the initial 10 minutes, giving a total of 60 minutes.<|im_end|>","James would take 18 ÷ 3 = <<18/3=6>>6 times longer if he read all 18 pages.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of people who chose different check-in options.

- **Early Checkout:** 24 guests
- **Late Checkout:** 15 guests

Total number of guests choosing either option is \(24 + 15 = 39\).

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people who checked in later than expected (afternoon check-ins).

Twice as many people checked in after noon compared to those who opted for a late checkout.

Number of people checking in after noon:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

### Step 3: Add the number of people who checked in after dinner.

After dinner, 7 more people checked in.

### Step 4: Sum up all the guests at the end of the day.

- Initial guests: 100
- Guests who chose early checkout: 24
- Guests who chose late checkout: 15
- Afternoon check-ins: 30
- Dinner check-ins: 7

Total number of guests:

\[ 100 + 24 + 15 + 30 + 7 = 176 \]

Therefore, the total number of guests the hotel has at the end of the day is **176**.<|im_end|>","24 guests checked out early and 15 checked out late so 24+15 = <<24+15=39>>39 guests checked out

   - John picks 4 bananas.

2. **Calculate the number of bananas picked on Thursday:**
   - John picks 6 bananas.

3. **Calculate the number of bananas picked on Friday:**
   - On Friday, John picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how many points Aries is sure to get in the quiz, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of easy, average, and difficult questions:**
   - The total number of questions is 60.
   - 40% of the questions are easy, so the number of easy questions is \( 0.4 \times 60 = 24 \).
   - The remaining questions (which are not easy) are equally divided between average and difficult, so they make up the other 60% of the questions. Thus, there are \( 30 \) average questions and \( 30 \) difficult questions.

2. **Determine the number of easy questions Aries will get correct:**
   - Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. Since there are 24 easy questions, the number of easy questions he can be certain about getting correct is \( 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \).

3. **Determine the number of average and difficult questions Aries will get correct:**
   - Half of the average questions are average, so Aries will get correct on \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) average questions.
   - Similarly, half of the difficult questions are difficult, so Aries will get correct on \( \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \) difficult questions.

4. **Sum the total points Aries will get:**
   - Points from easy questions: \( 18 \)
   - Points from average questions: \( 15 \)
   - Points from difficult questions: \( 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is:
\[ 18 + 15 + 15 = 48 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]<|im_end|>","The average and difficult questions comprises 100% - 40% = 60% of the quiz.

If Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions, then this means she is sure of her 24 questions x 75/100 = <<24*75/100=18>>18 points.
From the average and difficult questions, she is sure to get half of it correctly so that is 36 questions / 2 = <<36/2=18>>18 points.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Determine the cost per small stuffed animal**: Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4.

2. **Calculate total revenue from selling small stuffed animals**: Since Teresa sold 3 times more small stuffed animals than large ones and earned a total of $120 in revenue, let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( L \) and the number of small stuffed animals sold as \( S \).

   - The equation for total revenue would be: 
     \[
     4S = 120
     \]

   Solving for \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{120}{4} = 30
   \]
   
   So, Teresa sold 30 small stuffed animals today.

Let's summarize our work so far:

1. Cost per small stuffed animal: $4.
2. Total revenue: $120.

Now, let's verify if these values align with the conditions given in the problem.

Given:
- Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones (\( S = 2L \)).
- We've calculated \( S = 30 \).
  
Substitute \( S = 30 \) into the relationship between large and small stuffed animals:
\[
L = \frac{S}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, Teresa sold 15 large stuffed animals.

In conclusion:
Teresa sold 30 small stuffed animals.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{30}}
\]<|im_end|>","Let A be the number of large stuffed animals Teresa sold.

Thus, she sold A = 120 / 20 = <<120/20=6>>6 large stuffed animals today.
Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals, so she sold 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 small stuffed animals today.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Total number of eggs**: There are 100 eggs in total.

2. **Smiths' eggs**:
   - Each twin (Smith) found 30 eggs.
   - Therefore, both twins together found \(30 + 30 = 60\) eggs.

3. **Remaining eggs after accounting for Smiths**:
   - Subtract the eggs found by the twins from the total: 
     \[
     100 - 60 = 40
     \]
   So, there are 40 eggs left that need to be found by others.

4. **Other friends' eggs**:
   - We know that all other eggs except one were found by friends.
   - Since we have already accounted for the eggs found by the twins, only one egg remains unaccounted for among friends.

5. **Evaluating the statement**: ""All the other eggs except ? 10 were found by their friends.""
   - This means out of the remaining 40 eggs, exactly one was not found by friends because the rest were found by friends.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - If one egg remained unaccounted for among friends, then the number of eggs found by friends is:

- **Bare Hands**: The dwarf mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
  
- **Iron Pickaxe**: The dwarf mines twice as much as with bare hands.
  
\[ \text{Ore mined with Iron Pickaxe} = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds/day} \]

- **Steel Pickaxe**: The dwarf mines 50% more than with the iron pickaxe.
  
\[ \text{Ore mined with Steel Pickaxe} = 24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day.

Since there are 40 dwarves working with the steel pickaxes:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per sandwich and then use that information to find out the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

1. **Determine the cost per sandwich:**
   - The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.
     \[
     \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]

2. **Verify the consistency across packages:**
   - The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.
     \[
     \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$6}{4 \text{ sandwiches}} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
     \]
   This confirms that the cost per sandwich is consistent between the two packages.

3. **Calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:**
   - If the cost per sandwich is $1.50, then the cost of 8 sandwiches would be:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich} = \$12

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine the initial total number of balloons**

Sally has:
- 25 red balloons,
- 7 green balloons,
- 12 yellow balloons (we need to find out how many yellow balloons there were initially).

Let's denote the initial number of yellow balloons as \( Y \). Therefore, the total number of balloons at the start is:
\[ 25 + 7 + Y = T \]
where \( T \) is the total number of balloons.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of red balloons that burst**

A gust of wind causes 40% of the red balloons to burst. Since there are 25 red balloons, the number that bursts is:
\[ 0.40 \times 25 = 10 \]

So, after the wind, the number of red balloons left is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons that remain**

Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons. Initially, there were 12 yellow balloons. So, after releasing half of them:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons left is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

**Step 4: Add the remaining yellow balloons to the existing yellow balloons**

Now, we add the remaining 6 yellow balloons to the original 12 yellow balloons:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

**Step 5: Determine the total number of balloons before adding blue balloons**

After accounting for the red and yellow balloons, the total number of balloons before adding any blue ones is:
\[ 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) = 21 \]

**Step 6: Add the blue balloons captured in the tree**

Sally finds 8 blue balloons and adds them to her collection:
\[ 21 + 8 = 29 \]

**Step 7: Determine the total number of balloons after adding blue balloons**

At this point, Sally has 29 balloons in total.

**Step 8: Calculate the number of blue balloons added from the blue balloon tree**

Since the blue balloons she added come from the tree, they represent 75% of the blue balloons she originally had. Let’s denote the initial number of blue balloons as \( B \). Then:
\[ B = 0.75 \times 8 \]

First, calculate \( B \):
\[ B = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \]

**Step 9: Final count of all balloons**

Finally, the total number of balloons Sally carries into the school is:
\[ 29 (total balloons) + 6 (blue balloons) = 35 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]<|im_end|>","Sally started out with 25 red, 7 green, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25+7+12=<<25+7+12=44>>44 balloons.
But 40% of her 25 red balloons burst, which meant that she then had 0.4*25=<<0.4*25=10>>10 fewer red balloons.
The loud sound caused her to release half of her 12 yellow balloons, which means she then had (1/2)*12=<<12-6=6>>6 fewer yellow balloons.
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons she discovered, which means she added 0.75*8=<<75*.01*8=6>>6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Thus, she initially had 44 balloons, but 10 red ones burst, 6 yellow ones escaped, and she added 6 more blue ones, for a total of 44-10-6+6=<<44-10-6+6=34>>34 balloons

                    question:
                    Marcus is trying to ! decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.

What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the probability that Marcus will need to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all possible scenarios and their respective probabilities.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher:**
   - Probability (P(Substitute)): 50%
   
2. **If the substitute teacher is present:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, there’s a 40% chance they’ll give everyone an extension.
     - Probability (P(Extension | Substitute Teacher)): 60% (since it’s 100% minus the 40% extension)
     
3. **If the normal teacher comes in without an extension:**
   - There’s a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.
     - Probability (P(Personal Extension | No Extension): 80% (since it’s 100% minus the 20% no-extension)

Now let’s calculate the overall probability that Marcus will be required to turn in his homework:

- First, calculate the combined probability for both scenarios where there might not be any extensions from the substitute teacher or the normal teacher:
  
  P(No Extensions) = P(Substitute Teacher) * [P(Extension | Substitute Teacher) + P(Personal Extension | No Extension)]
                  = 0.5 * (0.6 + 0.8)
                  = 0.5 * 1.4
                  = 0.7

Since the total probability must sum up to 1, we subtract this value from 1 to find the remaining probability:

- P(Needs Homework) = 1 - P(No Extensions)
                      = 1 - 0.7
                      = 0.3

So, the final answer is {The final answer is} 30%.<|im_end|>","First find the chance that the normal teacher comes in by subtracting the odds she doesn't from 100%: 100% - 50% = 50%

Then find the chance that Marcus can't get a personal extension by subtracting the chance he does from 100%: 100% - 20% = 80%
Now find the chance the teacher comes in AND doesn't grant the whole class an extension by multiplying the two independent probabilities: .6 * .5 = <<.6*.5=.3>>.3

                    question:
                    Apple High School is holding graduation in their Fine Arts Center this year which has space for . 6000 : people.  After accounting for 950 . seats for graduates and 300 seats for ? faculty attending, how many tickets would each graduate receive to give to their friends and family if the tickets are split , equally?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of available seats.
2. Subtract the reserved seats (graduates' and faculty) from the total seats.
3. Divide the remaining seats by the number of students who will attend.

Let's go through it step-by-step:

### Step 1: Total Number of Available Seats
- The Fine Arts Center can accommodate 6000 people.

### Step 2: Subtract Reserved Seats
- Seats for graduates = 950
- Seats for faculty = 300
- Total reserved seats = 950 + 300 = 1250

Now subtract the reserved seats from the total seats:
\[ \text{Remaining seats} = 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left after accounting for the reserved seats.

### Step 3: Split Remaining Seats Equally Among Students
- Let \( x \) be the number of students.
- Each student gets an equal share of the remaining seats.

Since the remaining seats are 4750 and they need to be divided among \( x \) students, each student would get:
\[ \frac{4750}{x} \]

This expression represents the number of tickets each student receives. To find out what this value is, we need to know the total number of students (\( x \)) attending the event.

However, since no specific number of students was provided in the problem statement, we cannot determine the exact number of tickets each student would receive without additional information about the number of students at the event.

Given that the question asks for ""each student"" to receive a ticket, we conclude that the final answer depends on knowing the number of students. If we were to express the division as a general equation, it would look like:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4750}{x}} \]
where \( x \) is the number of students attending the event.<|im_end|>","Add graduate and faculty seats together. 950 + 300 = <<950+300=1250>>1250 seats for faculty and graduates

Divide amount of graduates by remaining seats. 4750/950 = <<4750/950=5>>5 tickets

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts:

Step 1: Determine how many medium-sized jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
Given that eating 3 small beans equals eating 1 medium-sized bean, we need to find out how many medium-sized beans fit in his stomach.

Let \( M \) be the number of medium-sized jelly beans he can eat. According to the given information, we have:
\[ 3 = \frac{M}{2} \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 6 \]

So, Grandpa can eat 6 medium-sized jelly beans.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of jelly beans Grandpa eats.
Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as large ones. Given that he needs 75 large jelly beans to fill him up, we calculate the total number of jelly beans he consumes:
\[ T = 2 \times L + M \]
where \( L \) represents the number of large jelly beans consumed.

Substitute \( L = 75 \) and \( M = 6 \):
\[ T = 2 \times 75 + 6 \]
\[ T = 150 + 6 \]
\[ T = 156 \]

Therefore, Grandpa consumes a total of 156 jelly beans.

Step 3: Determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat.
Since 3 small jelly beans equal one medium-sized jelly bean, we can express the relationship between small and medium jelly beans as follows:
\[ S = \frac{M}{3} \]

We already found that \( M = 6 \), so substituting this value gives us:
\[ S = \frac{6}{3} \]
\[ S = 2 \]

Thus, Grandpa can eat 2 small jelly beans.

Final Answer: The final answer is {The final answer is}: 2 small jelly beans.<|im_end|>","If Grandpa can eat twice as many medium beans as large beans, then eating 75 large beans is the same as eating 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 medium-sized jelly beans.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the books.
Ted buys 3 books at $0.16 each.

\[
\text{Cost of books} = 3 \times \$0.16
\]

\[
\text{Cost of books} = 3 \times 0.16

### Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total amount spent.
Now we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils.

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of books} + \text{Cost of pencils}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 0.48 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars}

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles:**
   - The width of the driveway is 24 feet.
   - Richard places a soda bottle every 3 feet.

\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Width of the driveway}}{\text{Distance between bottles}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet per bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}

2. **Determine the time to place each bottle and drop the candy:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to move from one bottle to the next and drop the candy.

Since there are 8 bottles, it will take Richard 5 seconds for each bottle (moving to the next bottle) plus an additional 5 seconds to drop the candy.

\[

   - Uncle Franky has two boxes.
   - Total apples = \( 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} \).

\[
\text{Total apples} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ apples}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheeses Amor bought and then determine if she has enough money left after her purchase.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese.
- Price of one pound of Parmesan cheese = $11
- Amount of Parmesan cheese bought = 0.2 pounds

Cost of Parmesan cheese = (Price per pound) × (Amount bought)
= ($11) × (0.2)
= $2.20

#### Step 2: Calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese.
- Price of one pound of Mozzarella cheese = $6
- Amount of Mozzarella cheese bought = 3 pounds

Cost of Mozzarella cheese = (Price per pound) × (Amount bought)
= ($6) × (3)
= $18.00

#### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all cheeses.
Total cost = Cost of Parmesan cheese + Cost of Mozzarella cheese
= $2.20 + $18.00
= $20.20

#### Step 4: Determine how much money Amor has left.
Amor started with $50.
Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
= $50 - $20.20
= $29.80

### Final Answer:
Amor will have **$29.80** left to spend on other items.<|im_end|>","The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.
The cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.
The total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.
So, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.

                    Jim decides to go to college to earn some more money.  It takes him 4 : years to finish and he gets $50,000 in loans per year.  . If he had a 25k a year job before college and his college degree tripled his income, how long ? would it take to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the ; money lost , from not working while in , school.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate total loan amount:**
   - Jim has $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
   \[
   \text{Total loan amount} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Determine the net gain from the additional income:**
   - Jim's current annual salary without college is $25,000.
   - His post-college salary will be three times that (since his degree triples his income).
   \[
   \text{Post-college salary} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
   \]
   - The net gain from the increased income after college is:
   \[
   \text{Net gain} = 75,000 - 25,000 = 50,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the time required to cover the loan amount using the new income:**
   - We know that the net gain from the increased income is $50,000, which is exactly equal to the total loan amount.
   - Therefore, the time taken to accumulate the loan amount through his post-college earnings is the same as the time it took to accumulate the loan amount during his studies.

Thus, the time it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost, from not working while in school, is also 4 years.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{4 years}}
\]<|im_end|>","His salary increased to 25000*3=$<<25000*3=75000>>75,000 per year
So he earns an extra 75,000-25,000=$<<75000-25000=50000>>50,000 a year
His loan cost 50,000*4=$<<50000*4=200000>>200,000
He lost out on 25,000*4=$<<25000*4=100000>>100,000 from not working
So he needs to make 200,000+100,000=$<<200000+100000=300000>>300,000
That means it will take 300,000/50,000=<<300000/50000=6>>6 years

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much fabric Jim needs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the dimensions of the comforter fabric:**
   - The bed has dimensions of 6 feet (length) x 8 feet (width).
   - The comforter fabric should be 2 feet longer on both ends and 2 feet wider.

2. **Determine the new length and width of the comforter fabric:**
   - Length: \(6 \text{ ft} + 2 \text{ ft} = 8 \text{ ft}\)
   - Width: \(8 \text{ ft} + 2 \text{ ft} = 10 \text{ ft}\)

3. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area of one piece of fabric = Length × Width = \(8 \text{ ft} \times 10 \text{ ft} = 80 \text{ sq ft}\).

4. **Determine the total number of pieces needed:**
   - Jim needs two pieces of fabric.
   - Total area required = \(2 \times 80 \text{ sq ft} = 160 \text{ sq ft}\).

5. **Conclusion:**

Therefore, Jim needs to buy **160 square feet** of fabric to make the comforter. 

\[
\boxed{\text{Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.}}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Tuesday**

On Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many letters as on Monday.

- One-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 425 \)

Let's calculate that first:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]

So, one-fifth of the letters delivered on Monday is 85.

Now, add 17 to this amount for Tuesday:

\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]

Therefore, the post office delivered **102 letters** on Tuesday.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of letters delivered on Wednesday**

On Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many letters as on Tuesday.

- Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday = \( 2 \times 102 \)

Let's calculate that first:

\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]

So, twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 204.

Now, add 5 to this amount for Wednesday:

\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]

Therefore, the post office delivered **209 letters** on Wednesday.

**Step 3: Sum up the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday**

- Letters delivered on Monday = 425
- Letters delivered on Tuesday = 102
- Letters delivered on Wednesday = 209

Let's sum these amounts:

\[ 425 + 102 + 209 \]

First, add 425 and 102:

\[ 425 + 102 = 527 \]

Then, add 527 and 209:

\[ 527 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is **736**.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is 736}.<|im_end|>","Monday = <<425=425>>425 letters

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken salad for all guests who want it.
- Number of guests who want chicken salad = 10
- Cost per person for chicken salad = $6.50

Total cost for chicken salad = Number of guests * Cost per person
\[ \text{Total cost} = 10 \times 6.50 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 10 \times 6.50 = 65.00 \]

So, the total cost for the chicken salad is $65.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pasta salad for all guests who want it.
- Number of guests who want pasta salad = 6
- Cost per person for pasta salad = $6

Total cost for pasta salad = Number of guests * Cost per person
\[ \text{Total cost} = 6 \times 6 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36.00 \]

So, the total cost for the pasta salad is $36.00.

### Step 3: Add the costs together to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.
Total amount paid = Total cost for chicken salad + Total cost for pasta salad
\[ \text{Total amount paid} = 65.00 + 36.00 \]

Let's do the addition:
\[ 65.00 + 36.00 = 101.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.00.<|im_end|>","Multiply the number of people who want chicken salad by the cost per person, so the cost is 10 x $6.50 = $<<10*6.5=65>>65.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how much Johnny lost on average over the three races, we need to calculate the total amount lost and then divide it by the number of races.

**Step 1: Calculate the winnings from the second race**

Johnny won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. He lost $5 in the first race.

First, find twice the amount lost in the first race:

\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Then add $1 to this amount to get the winnings from the second race:

\[10 + 1 = 11\]

So, Johnny won $11 in the second race.

**Step 2: Calculate the losses from the third race**

Johnny lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. He won $11 in the second race.

Calculate 1.5 times the winnings from the second race:

\[1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\]

So, Johnny lost $16.5 in the third race.

**Step 3: Calculate the total losses**

Add up all the losses:

\[5 (first\ loss) + 11 (second\ win) - 16.5 (third\ loss)\]

\[= 5 + 11 - 16.5\]

\[= 16 - 16.5\]

\[= -0.5\]

Johnny lost $0.5 in total across the three races.

**Step 4: Determine the average loss per race**

There were three races in total. To find the average loss per race, divide the total loss by the number of races:

\[\frac{-0.5}{3} = -0.1667\]

Therefore, Johnny lost an average of $-0.1667 per race.

{The final answer is}

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after they've grown over the summer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the current height for Xavier:**
   - Initial height: 4 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
   - Growth in height: 3 inches
   - Current height: \( 4 \text{ feet} + 3 \text{ inches} \)

   First convert feet into inches:
   \[
   4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
   
   Add the growth:
   \[
   48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the current height for Cole:**
   - Initial height: 50 inches
   - Growth in height: 2 inches
   - Current height: \( 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} \)

   Since Cole's initial height already matches his current height, he has not grown at all.

3. **Determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier:**

   The difference in height is calculated by subtracting Cole's current height from Xavier's current height.
   
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 51 \text{ inches} - 50 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
   \]

Therefore, the difference in height between Cole and Xavier is \(1\) inch.<|im_end|>","First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person received based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) represent the amount of money that the first person receives.

### Step 2: Express Other Amounts in Terms of \( x \)
- According to the problem, the second person takes $80 more than the first person. So, the second person's share can be expressed as \( x + 80 \).
- The third person takes twice what the second person took. Therefore, the third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) \).

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
Since the total amount is $1920, we can write the equation for the sum of their shares as follows:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
First, simplify inside the parentheses:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \] (since \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \))
Combine like terms:
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 240 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person receives $420.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is {The first person received $420}.<|im_end|>","Let X be the amount of what the first took.

   - Each painter works for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The team worked for 3 weeks.

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
\]

2. **Determine the total amount of time (in days) all painters worked together:**
   - Since there are 4 painters working, we multiply the total days by the number of painters.

\[
\text{Total time (days)} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ days}
\]

3. **Convert the total time from days into hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in one day.
   - We divide the total time in days by 24.

\[
\text{Total time (hours)} = \frac{84 \times 24}{24} = 84 \text{ hours}

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we will use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set. Let's define \( x \) as the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.

Given that Rory retrieves 4 more balls in the first set compared to the second set, we can express the number of balls retrieved in the first set as:
\[ x + 4 \]

For the third set, he retrieves half as many balls as in the second set, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is:
\[ \frac{x}{2} \]

We know the total number of balls retrieved is 19. Therefore, we can write an equation representing the sum of the balls retrieved in all three sets:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 19 \]

Now, let's simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[
(x + 4) + x + \left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 19
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( x \):
\[
2x + \frac{x}{2} = 15
\]
Combine the terms on the left side:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 15
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

So, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set. Now, we calculate the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Thus, Rory retrieved **10** tennis balls in the first set of the match.<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the third set.
In the second set, he retrieved 2B balls.
In the first set, he retrieved 2B + 4 balls.
In total, he retrieved B + 2B + 2B + 4 = 5B + 4 = 19 balls.
Thus, 5B = 19 - 4 = 15 balls.
Therefore, in the third set, Rory retrieved B = 15 / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 balls.
Hence, in the second set, he retrieved 2B = 3 * 2 = 6 balls.
In the first set he retrieved 2(3) + 4 balls = 10

                    question:
                    ; Ben bought a car for $20000 in 2007. The price of the car depreciates : at a constant rate of 21% per year. Find the price of the car in the year 2010.
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the depreciation factor and then apply it to the initial value of the car.

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation factor.
The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, 89% (100 - 21) of the previous year's value remains. We can express this as a multiplication factor of 0.89.

Step 2: Apply the depreciation factor to the initial value.
Let's denote the initial value of the car as \( P_0 = \$20000 \). The value of the car after one year will be \( P_1 = P_0 \times 0.89 \).

Step 3: Calculate the value of the car in 2010.
Since there are three years between 2007 and 2010, we need to multiply the value from Step 2 by itself three times (once for each year):

\[ P_{\text{final}} = P_1^3 = (P_0 \times 0.89)^3 \]

Now let's compute the numerical values:

First, calculate \( P_1 \):
\[ P_1 = 20000 \times 0.89 = 17800 \]

Then, calculate \( P_{\text{final}} \):
\[ P_{\text{final}} = 17800^3 \]

Finally, compute \( 17800^3 \):
\[ 17800^3 = 5662400000000 \]

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be approximately **$5662400000000**. However, since financial contexts often deal with more manageable numbers, we might round this number down or up based on practical considerations. For simplicity, if we were to present this directly without further context, the exact calculation yields an extremely large figure which doesn't have much practical significance unless stated otherwise. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

The final answer is: **$5662400000000**<|im_end|>","The price of the car depreciates of 20000 * 21% = $<<20000*21*.01=4200>>4200 per year.
Ben had the car for 2010 - 2007 = <<2010-2007=3>>3 years.
The price of the car depreciates 4200 * 3 = $<<4200*3=12600>>12600 from 2007 to 2010.
So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books that are not in English**

- Total number of books = 50
- Number of books in English = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \)

So, the remaining books (not in English) will be:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of books that are in German**

- Percentage of books in German = 10%
- Number of books in German = \( 10\% \times 50 = 5 \)

**Step 3: Subtract the number of books in English and German from the total to find the number of Spanish books**

Total books minus books in English minus books in German equals the number of Spanish books:
\[ 50 - 25 - 5 = 10 \]

Therefore, **the number of Spanish books is 10**.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is The number of Spanish books is 10.<|im_end|>","Half of the books are in English, which means 50 * 0.5 = <<50*0.5=25>>25 books.
German books make up to 10%, which means there are 10/100 * 50 = <<10/100*50=5>>5 of them.
So as a result there are 50 - 25 - 5 = <<50-25-5=20>>20 Spanish books in the library.

                    question:
                    It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to . New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to : drive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many more kilometers Bernice needs to drive, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Bernice has driven 325 kilometers over 4 days.
   
2. **Subtract this distance from the total distance between San Diego and New York**:
   - The total distance from San Diego to New York is approximately 1955 kilometers.

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled
Bernice drives at an average speed of 325 kilometers per 4 days. We can find out how far she travels in one day by dividing her total distance by the number of days:

\[
\text{Distance per day} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Number of days}}
\]

Given:
- Total distance = 325 kilometers
- Number of days = 4

\[
\text{Distance per day} = \frac{325}{4}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\text{Distance per day} = 81.25 \text{ kilometers/day}
\]

Now, multiply the daily distance by the number of days to get the total distance traveled:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = \text{Distance per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 81.25 \times 4
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total distance traveled} = 325 \text{ kilometers}
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the distance traveled from the total distance between two cities
We know that the total distance between San Diego and New York is approximately 1955 kilometers. 

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Distance traveled}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 1955 - 325
\]

Perform the subtraction:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 1630 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive:

\[ 
\boxed{1630 \text{ kilometers}}
\]<|im_end|>","325 * 4 = <<325*4=1300>>1300 km

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days:**
   - Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day.
   - There are 30 days in the period we're considering.

2. **Calculate the total number of cups of water over 30 days:**
   \[
   8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Convert the total number of cups into gallons:**
   - We know that there are 16 cups in one gallon.
   
4. **Perform the conversion calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}

<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases step-by-step.

1. **Tank Top Cost:**
   - The tank top costs $10.
   
2. **Running Shorts Cost:**
   - Running shorts are $5 more expensive than the tank top.
     \[
     10 + 5 = 15
     \]
   So, the running shorts cost $15.

3. **Tennis Shoes Cost:**
   - The original price of the tennis shoes is $48.
   - They are on sale for half price.
     \[
     \frac{48}{2} = 24
     \]
   So, the discounted price of the tennis shoes is $24.

4. **Athletic Socks Cost:**
   - The original price of the socks is $8.
   - There is a $2 discount.
     \[
     8 - 2 = 6
     \]
   So, the discounted price of the socks is $6.

Now, let's sum up all these costs:

- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Adding them together gives us:
\[
10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55
\]

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear. {The final answer is} $55.<|im_end|>","The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the cost of installing new square floor tiles for your kitchen, let's break down the problem into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Tile
Each tile is square-shaped with a side length of 1 foot.

- **Area of one tile** = Side length × Side length
- **Area of one tile** = \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ sq ft}\)

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Tiles Needed
Total area of the kitchen floor = 200 sq ft.
Number of tiles needed = Total area / Area per tile
\[ \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{200 \text{ sq ft}}{1 \text{ sq ft/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost Per Tile
Cost per tile = $12

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost
Total cost = Number of tiles × Cost per tile
\[ \text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12/\text{tile} = \$2400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with these square tiles would be $\boxed{2400}$.<|im_end|>","The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and calculate the total amount James will pay in one year.

Step 1: Determine the increased cost due to the accident.
James' usual monthly insurance cost is $120. Since having an accident results in 60% more than normal, we first need to find out what 60% of his normal cost is.

Calculation for the additional cost due to the accident:
\[ \text{Additional Cost} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the total monthly cost after the accident is:
\[ \text{Total Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Step 2: Calculate the yearly cost based on the new monthly rate.
Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the total monthly cost by 12 to get the annual cost.

Calculation for the annual cost:
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, the amount James will pay in one year is **$2304**.<|im_end|>","The insurance is 120*.6=$<<120*.6=72>>72 per month more expensive than normal

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many laundry loads Greg needs for one year, let's break down his weekly sheet washing schedule:

### Step 1: Calculate Weekly Loads
- **Twin Beds**: Greg has 4 twin beds.
- **King Bed**: He has 1 king bed.

For each load, he can wash either:
- All four twin beds (one load)
- One king bed (another load)

Given that he can't wash more than one king set per load and he can wash up to two twin sets per load:

1. Each load covers all 4 twin beds if there's room for 2 loads of twins.
2. Each load covers one king bed if there's space for 1 load of kings.

Since he can't fit both types into any single load due to the limited capacity of his washer, we need to consider different combinations:

- If he uses 2 loads of twins (covers all 8 twin beds), then he still needs to use 1 load for the king bed.
- Alternatively, if he uses 1 load of twins and another load of kings, he effectively uses 3 loads of twins and 1 load of kings.

Let's calculate this:

- **If he uses 2 loads of twins**:
  - Total sheets washed = 2 * 4 = 8 sheets
  - Remaining sheets = 16 - 8 = 8 sheets

- **If he uses 1 load of twins and 1 load of kings**:
  - Sheets from twins = 2 * 4 = 8 sheets
  - Sheets from kings = 1 * 1 = 1 sheet
  - Total sheets washed = 8 + 1 = 9 sheets

So, he would need 2 or 3 loads depending on how he combines the twin and king sheets.

### Step 2: Determine Annual Load Requirement
- **Weekly Load Calculation**:
  - For 2 loads of twins: \( \frac{52}{2} \) weeks = 26 loads
  - For 1 load of twins and 1 load of kings: \( \frac{52}{3} \) weeks ≈ 17.33 loads

- **Total annual loads**:
  - If using 2 loads of twins: \( 26 \times 2 = 52 \) loads
  - If using 1 load of twins and 1 load of kings: \( 17.33 \times 2 \approx 34.67 \) loads

Since Greg can't wash partial loads and he must complete full loads within the same day, he will have to round up to ensure he doesn’t miss any sheets even if it means having multiple loads in a single day.

Therefore, considering practical constraints and ensuring he completes all washes in a single day:

- **Final Answer**: Greg should plan to do approximately **35 loads** of laundry per year, as doing more than 34 loads could lead to incomplete days where some loads might go uncompleted.<|im_end|>","He has to wash 4 twin size sheet sets each week and the machine will only let him do 2 sets at a time so he has to do 4/2 = <<4/2=2>>2 loads of twin size sheets

   - Number of movies on Sunday = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

3. **Find out how many total movies are watched over two weekends (Saturday + Sunday):**
   - Total movies for one weekend = Movies on Saturday + Movies on Sunday
   - Total movies for two weekends = \( 4 \times 2 + 2 \times 2 \)

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

**Step 1: Determine how many stickers Leo has two years ago.**

Leo started with 100 stickers two years ago.

**Step 2: Calculate how many stickers Leo collected last year.**

Last year, Leo collected 50 more stickers than he did two years ago.

So, if Leo had 100 stickers two years ago, he collected:

\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

stickers last year.

**Step 3: Determine how many stickers Leo collected this year.**

This year, Leo collected twice as many stickers as he did last year.

Since he collected 150 stickers last year, this year he collected:

\[ 2 \times 150 = 300 \]

stickers.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of stickers Leo has now.**

Add up all the stickers from different times:

- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 150 stickers (collected)
- This year: 300 stickers (collected)

Total number of stickers:

\[ 100 + 150 + 300 = 550 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

                    question:
                    ! Imma has 3 cats. She , feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food. How many . days will 720 grams of cat food last?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how long 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's three cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate daily food consumption per cat:**
   - Each cat eats 60 grams of cat food twice a day.
   \[
   \text{Daily food consumption per cat} = 60 \, \text{grams/day} \times 2 = 120 \, \text{grams/cat/day}
   \]

2. **Calculate total daily food consumption for all three cats:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily food consumption} = 120 \, \text{grams/cat/day} \times 3 = 360 \, \text{grams/day}
   \]

3. **Determine how many days the total amount of cat food will last:**
   - We have 720 grams of cat food available.
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Total daily food consumption}} = \frac{720 \, \text{grams}}{360 \, \text{grams/day}}
   \]
   Simplifying this division:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{720}{360} = 2
   \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's three cats for **2 days**.<|im_end|>","The 3 cats consume 60 grams/cat x 3 cats = <<60*3=180>>180 grams of food per meal.
Since they eat twice a day, then they consume 180 grams/meal x 2 meals/day = <<180*2=360>>360 grams in a day.
So, 720 grams of cat food only last for 720 grams / 360 grams/day = <<720/360=2>>2 days.

                    question:
                    Becky, Jake, and Silvia shared 4 pizzas. Each pizza had 8 slices. Becky ate 3 more slices ! than Jake did. Silvia ate twice as many slices than Jake did. If Becky ate 10 slices, how many total slices did they eat?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices each person ate and then sum those values.

**Step 1: Determine how many slices Jake ate**

Given that Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake does, let's denote the number of slices Jake ate as \( J \). Therefore, Becky ate \( J + 3 \) slices.

Since Becky ate 10 slices, we can write:
\[ J + 3 = 10 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

So, Jake ate **7 slices**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of slices Silvia ate**

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Since Jake ate 7 slices, Silvia ate:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 3: Sum up all the slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia**

- Becky ate 10 slices.
- Jake ate 7 slices.
- Silvia ate 14 slices.

Adding these together gives us the total number of slices eaten:
\[ 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Betsy's part of the meal took. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( D \) represent the number of minutes that Donovan took for his part.
Then, since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part would be \( D + 18 \).

### Step 2: Set Up an Equation
We know the total time taken for both parts is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( D \)
Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 98 - 18 \]
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = \frac{80}{2} \]
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan took 40 minutes.

### Step 5: Find Betsy's Time
Since Betsy's part took 18 more minutes than Donovan's:
\[ Betsy's\ time = D + 18 \]
\[ Betsy's\ time = 40 + 18 \]
\[ Betsy's\ time = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal took **58** minutes.<|im_end|>","Let D = Donovan's time in minutes

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to calculate the costs for each service provided separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast:**
   - The cost of the cast is $200.
   
2. **Cost of the visit:**
   - The visit lasts for 30 minutes. Since the charge rate is per hour, we need to convert 30 minutes into hours. 
     \[
     \text{Time in hours} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The cost per hour for the visit is $40 (since it’s $4 per pill for 30 pills at $0.13 per pill).
     \[
     \text{Total cost of visit} = 0.5 \times \$40 = \$20
     \]

3. **Cost of the parking:**
   - The parking fee is $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours.
     \[
     \text{Parking cost} = 2 \times \$6 = \$12
     \]

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total amount:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cast cost} + \text{Visit cost} + \text{Parking cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$200 + \$20 + \$12 = \$232
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $\boxed{\$232}$.<|im_end|>","First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours

   - James receives 80 emails per day.

2. **Determine how many emails do not require a response:**
   - According to the information given, 20% of the emails do not require a response.
   
3. **Calculate the number of emails that require a response:**
   - Since 20% of the emails do not require a response, the remaining 80% must require a response.
   
4. **Convert the percentage into a decimal for easier calculation:**
   - 20% = 0.20
   - Therefore, 80% = 0.80
   
5. **Calculate the number of emails requiring a response per day:**
   - Number of emails requiring a response per day = Total emails * Percentage needing response
   - Number of emails requiring a response per day = 80 * 0.80 = 64

6. **Calculate the total number of emails James needs to respond to over 5 days:**
   - Total emails needing response over 5 days = Emails requiring response per day * Days in a work week
   - Total emails needing response over 5 days = 64 * 5 = 320

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the glee club.
2. Determine how many pizzas the glee club originally ordered.
3. Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the football team.
4. Determine how many pizzas the football team originally ordered.
5. Subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the original orders to find out how many are left.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the glee club
- The glee club ordered 20 pizzas.
- They ate 70% of them.

\[
\text{Number of pizzas eaten by the glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pizzas the glee club originally ordered
We know that they ate 14 pizzas and ordered 20 pizzas.

\[
\text{Original order for the glee club} = \frac{14}{0.70} = 20 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many pizzas were eaten by the football team
- The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club (i.e., \(2 \times 20 = 40\) pizzas).
- They ate 80% of them.

\[
\text{Number of pizzas eaten by the football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many pizzas the football team originally ordered
Since the football team ate 32 pizzas, their original order was:

\[
\text{Original order for the football team} = \frac{32}{0.80} = 40 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 5: Subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the original orders to find out how many are left

For the glee club:
\[
\text{Pizzas left for the glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6
\]

For the football team:
\[
\text{Pizzas left for the football team} = 40 - 32 = 8
\]

Now, let's add up the remaining pizzas:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the total amount Anthony spends on postage, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the number of large coupons**
- Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons.
- The number of large coupons is twice the number of small coupons.

\[
\text{Number of large coupons} = 2 \times \text{Number of small coupons}
\]

Substitute the given value (700 small coupons):

\[
\text{Number of large coupons} = 2 \times 700 = 1400
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of mailing small coupons**
- Each small coupon costs $0.05 (5 cents).

\[
\text{Total cost for small coupons} = \text{Number of small coupons} \times \text{Cost per small coupon}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for small coupons} = 700 \times 0.05 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of mailing large coupons**
- Each large coupon costs $0.15 (15 cents).

\[
\text{Total cost for large coupons} = \text{Number of large coupons} \times \text{Cost per large coupon}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for large coupons} = 1400 \times 0.15 = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all coupons**

Add the costs from both types of coupons:

\[
\text{Total postage cost} = \text{Total cost for small coupons} + \text{Total cost for large coupons}
\]

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney originally ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered ""! 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.""
   - This means Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.

2. **Calculate how many meatball sub sandwiches Mark ate from Sidney's order:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Therefore, Sidney has \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches remaining after Mark eats his share.

3. **Add to the original order what Sidney added later:**
   - Sidney then ordered ""another three sub sandwiches.""
   - Adding these to the remaining 3 sandwiches gives us \(3 + 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is \(\boxed{6}\).<|im_end|>","3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10-3=<<10-3=7>>7 sub sandwiches.
After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 remained.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trucks dispatched.
2. Calculate how many trucks had mechanical failures.
3. Subtract the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks to find out how many trucks delivered successfully.
4. Calculate the total amount of fertilizer carried by the successful trucks.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of trucks dispatched
Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatching fertilizer.

### Step 2: Calculate how many trucks had mechanical failures
A quarter of the number of trucks dispatched had mechanical failures. Therefore, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks
Subtract the number of failed trucks from the total number of trucks to find out how many trucks delivered successfully:
\[
\text{Number of trucks delivering successfully} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer carried by the successful trucks
Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer. So, the total amount of fertilizer delivered can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total fertilizer delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \( \boxed{300} \).<|im_end|>","If there were 20 trucks dispatched for delivery, and 1/4 of the total number had mechanical failures, there were 1/4*20 = <<20*1/4=5>>5 failed deliveries.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. Determine the number of pounds of butter needed.
2. Calculate the total cost before the discount.
3. Apply the discount and calculate the final cost.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Pounds of Butter Needed
Dennis wants to make 6 dozen croissants. Since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, he needs:
\[ \text{Total croissants} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \]

Since he uses 1 pound of butter per dozen croissants, he will need:
\[ \text{Pounds of butter} = 72 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost Before the Discount
Given that the price of one pound of butter is $4.00, the total cost before applying any discounts would be:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 72 \times \$4.00 = \$288.00 \]

### Step 3: Apply the Discount and Calculate the Final Cost
The grocery store offers a promotion where you can buy one pound of butter at full price and receive the second pound at half price. This means for every pound purchased, you pay full price but get the second pound for free.

Since Dennis buys 6 pounds, he will pay full price for 5 pounds and get the sixth pound for free. Therefore, his effective cost will be:
\[ \text{Effective cost} = (5 \times \$4.00) + (\$4.00 / 2) = \$20.00 + \$2.00 = \$22.00 \]

So, the final answer is: $\boxed{\$22.00}$<|im_end|>","1 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants and he needs to make 6 dozen so he needs 1*6 = <<1*6=6>>6 pounds of butter

<|im_start|>superior
To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the initial rental fee and the per-person charge.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Calculate the number of guests:**
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - She has 13 family members.
   
   Total number of guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family members)
   \[
   \text{Total guests} = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45
   \]

2. **Determine if any guests can't attend:**
   - Out of these 45 guests, only 4 people said they couldn't come.
   
3. **Calculate the number of guests who will actually attend:**
   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 45 - 4 = 41
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost based on the number of attendees:**
   - The initial rental fee is $125 for 20 guests.
   - There is an extra charge of $6 for each additional guest beyond 20.
   
   Since there are 41 guests attending:
   - Number of extra guests = \(41 - 20 = 21\)

   Cost due to the extra guests:
   \[
   \text{Cost per extra guest} = \$6 \times 21 = \$126
   \]

   Adding the initial rental fee:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$125 + \$126 = \$251
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total cost of Kayla's birthday party is $\boxed{251}$.<|im_end|>","Kayla invited 25 classmates + 7 dance class friends + 13 family members = <<25+7+13=45>>45 people invited.
Of the 45 people invited – 4 people cannot come = <<45-4=41>>41 people attending the party.
Of the 41 people attending – 20 are included in the fee = <<41-20=21>>21 additional guests not included in the fee.
The cost for 21 additional guests is 21 x $6 = $<<21*6=126>>126.
The total cost for the party is the $125 fee + $126 for additional guests = $<<125+126=251>>251.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much money each person initially had:**
   - Let \( M \) be the amount of money Maggie had.
   - Let \( R \) be the amount of money Riza had.

2. **Set up equations based on the information given:**
   - Maggie spent a quarter of her money: \( \frac{M}{4} \).
   - Riza spent one-third of her money: \( \frac{R}{3} \).

3. **Use the fact that they both ended up with $60:**
   - After spending their respective portions, Maggie has $60 left: 
     \[
     M - \frac{M}{4} = 60
     \]
   - Similarly, for Riza:
     \[
     R - \frac{R}{3} = 60
     \]

4. **Solve these equations to find \( M \) and \( R \):**

5. **For Maggie:**
   \[
   M - \frac{M}{4} = 60 \\
   \frac{4M - M}{4} = 60 \\
   \frac{3M}{4} = 60 \\
   3M = 240 \\
   M = 80
   \]

6. **For Riza:**
   \[
   R - \frac{R}{3} = 60 \\
   \frac{3R - R}{3} = 60 \\
   \frac{2R}{3} = 60 \\
   2R = 180 \\
   R = 90
   \]

7. **Calculate the total initial amount of money they had together:**
   \[
   M + R = 80 + 90 = 170
   \]

8. **Subtract the amount they spent from their initial amounts to find out how much they have left:**
   - Maggie spent $60, so she has $20 left.
   - Riza spent $60, so she has $0 left (since we only consider positive values).

9. **Summing up what they have left:**
   \[
   20 + 0 = 20
   \]

### Conclusion:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

                    question:
                    Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his , three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bananas each monkey consumes per day given that the total number of bananas (315) can be divided among the monkeys in such a way that the second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the daily consumption of the first monkey:**
   - Mr. Robles has enough bananas for three monkeys for one week.
   - There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of bananas required for three monkeys over seven days is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) bananas.
   
   Since the total number of bananas is 315, and these bananas are shared among the three monkeys for one week, we know that the first monkey must consume exactly half of the total bananas in a single day.

   Therefore, the first monkey eats:
   \[
   \frac{315}{3} = 105 \text{ bananas per day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total banana consumption by the first two monkeys:**
   - The first monkey eats 105 bananas per day.
   - The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so it eats:
     \[
     105 + 4 = 109 \text{ bananas per day}
     \]
   - Together, the first and second monkeys eat:
     \[
     105 + 109 = 214 \text{ bananas per day}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining bananas after accounting for the first two monkeys:**
   - Subtract the total banana consumption of the first two monkeys from the total number of bananas:
     \[
     315 - 214 = 101 \text{ bananas left}
     \]

4. **Determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day:**
   - The third monkey eats the remaining bananas after the first two monkeys have been fed.
   - Thus, the third monkey eats:
     \[
     \frac{101}{3} = 33.67 \text{ bananas per day}
     \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats approximately 33.67 bananas each day. 

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{The third monkey eats about 33.67 bananas per day}}
\]<|im_end|>","Each day, the three monkeys eat a total of 315/7 = <<315/7=45>>45 bananas.

Hence, the third monkey eats 45 - 24 = <<45-24=21>>21 bananas each day.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the roses:**
   - Each rose costs $2.
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   - Total cost = \( 15 \times 2 = \$30 \).

2. **Determine the total amount of money Jenny has initially:**
   - She arrives with 5 $5 bills.
   - Total initial amount = \( 5 \times 5 = \$25 \).

3. **Subtract the cost of the roses from her initial amount to find out how much money she has left after purchasing the roses:**
   - Money left after purchase = Initial amount - Cost of roses.
   - Money left = \( 25 - 30 = -$5 \).

4. **Since she cannot pay for the roses with her remaining money (which is negative), we need to consider the possibility that she might not be able to make any purchases at all given her current balance.**

5. **Check if she can use her quarters to get any change:**
   - The total number of quarters in her purse would depend on how many she had before going shopping.
   - Since she doesn't seem to have enough quarters or dollars to cover the full price of the roses without borrowing additional funds, she will not receive any change.

- Terry sells 6 milkshakes at $5.50 each.
\[
\text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33

<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the information provided and solve the problem step by step.

1. **First Train Arrival Time and Duration:**
   - Scheduled arrival time: 10 minutes from now.
   - Duration of staying in the station: 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train Arrival Time and Duration:**
   - Scheduled arrival time: Half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - Duration of staying in the station: Quarter of the duration of the first train = \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \) minutes.

3. **Third Train Arrival Time and Duration:**
   - Scheduled arrival time: An hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Duration of staying in the station: Immediately after arriving, so no additional time needed.

4. **Fourth Train Arrival Time and Duration:**
   - Scheduled arrival time: 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Duration of staying in the station: No additional time needed since the train departs immediately upon arrival.

Now let's calculate the total waiting time:

- First train: 10 minutes from now until its arrival.
- Second train: 30 minutes from now until its departure.
- Third train: Immediate departure.
- Fourth train: 20 minutes from now until its departure.

Adding these times together gives us the total waiting time:

\[ 10 + 30 + 0 + 20 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 60 minutes. 

**The final answer is:** 60 minutes.<|im_end|>","The first train stays in the station for 10 minutes * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 minutes.
So Paul waits for the first train for 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 minutes.
The second train arrives after half an hour, which is the same as 60 minutes / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 minutes.
It then stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train did which is 20 minutes / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 minutes.
So Paul waits for the second train for 30 + 5 = <<30+5=35>>35 minutes.
The third train arrives an hour later, which is the same as 60 minutes * 1 hour = <<60*1=60>>60 minutes.
After the final wait, Paul has waited a total of 30 minutes for the first train + 35 minutes for the second train + 60 minutes for the third train + 20 minutes final wait = <<30+35+60+20=145>>145 minutes.

                    question:
                    Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. Melanie’s mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. ! Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks if she continues saving at the same rate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved.
2. Determine how many additional toothpicks she needs to reach 200.
3. Calculate how long it will take her to save those remaining toothpicks.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Calculate the total number of toothpicks Melanie has already saved:**
   - She saves 10 toothpicks per week.
   - She has been saving for 12 weeks.
   \[
   10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

2. **Determine how many additional toothpicks she needs to reach 200:**
   \[
   200 \text{ toothpicks (total needed)} - 120 \text{ toothpicks (already saved)} = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
   \]

3. **Calculate how long it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:**
   - She saves 10 toothpicks per week.
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie an additional 8 weeks to collect enough toothpicks to meet her goal.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is \(8\) weeks.<|im_end|>","Melanie has already saved 10 toothpicks x 12 weeks = <<10*12=120>>120 toothpicks.
She needs to save 200 – 120 = <<200-120=80>>80 more toothpicks to reach her goal.
She'll have 80 toothpicks / 10 each week = in <<80/10=8>>8 more weeks.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the original price of the watch.
Mr. Rogers bought the watch for 75% of its original price.

Given:
- The original price \( P \) = \$2000

So,
\[ 0.75P = \$2000 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):
\[ P = \frac{\$2000}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \$2666.67 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the selling price to Mr. Rogers' friend.
Mr. Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the purchase price.

Given:
- Purchase price (from Mr. Rogers) = \$2000

So,
\[ 1.20 \times 2000 = \$2400 \]

This means Mr. Rogers' friend bought the watch for \$2400.

### Step 3: Determine the discount amount.
Discount amount = Original Price - Sale Price

Given:
- Original Price = \$2666.67
- Sale Price = \$2400

So,
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$2666.67 - \$2400 \]
\[ \text{Discount Amount} = \$266.67 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage discount.
Percentage Discount = \(\left( \frac{\text{Discount Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100\)

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} = \left( \frac{\$266.67}{\$2666.67} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage Discount} \approx 9.98\% \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Mr. Roger bought the perfume at $2000 x 75/100 = $<<2000*75/100=1500>>1500.

So, Mr. Roger's friend paid $2000 - $1800 = $<<2000-1800=200>>200 less than the original price.
So, his friend got $200/$2000 x 100% = <<200/2000*100=10>>10% discount.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the rate of jellyfish creation per spring:**
   - Every second, one new jellyfish is created.
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3600\) seconds in an hour.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours:**
   - There are 4 hours, so we multiply the number of seconds in one hour by 4:
     \[
     3600 \text{ seconds/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jellyfish created by all springs over 4 hours:**
   - Each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.
   - Therefore, in 4 hours (which is 14400 seconds), each spring will create:
     \[
     14400 \text{ seconds} \times 1 \text{ jellyfish/second} = 14400 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]
   - Since there are 5 springs, the total number of jellyfish created by all springs combined is:
     \[
     14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} \times 5 \text{ springs} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
     \]

Therefore, after 4 hours, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate is \(\boxed{72000}\).<|im_end|>","Since an hour has 3600 seconds, if every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish, it will create 4*3600 = <<4*3600=14400>>14400 jellyfish in four hours.

Frankie's score is described as being 15 more than twice Binkie's score.

Step 3: Calculate twice Binkie's score.
Twice Binkie's score = 2 * Binkie's score = 2 * 90 = 180

Step 4: Add 15 to find Frankie's score.
Frankie's score = Twice Binkie's score + 15 = 180 + 15 = 195

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the trip to the store and the return trip.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the distance for each part of the journey**:
   - The total distance from home to the store is 4 miles.
   - Since James walked half way, the distance to the store is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) miles.

2. **Calculate the time taken to reach the store**:
   - We know that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
   - To find the time, use the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time taken for the return trip**:
   - Similarly, since James walks back to the starting point (home), the distance for the return trip is also 2 miles.
   - Using the same speed of 4 miles per hour:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on both trips**:
   - Add the time taken to reach the store and the time taken for the return trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bananas Jenny bought.
Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains an average of 4 bananas.

\[
\text{Total number of bananas} = \text{Number of bunches} \times \text{Bansanas per bunch}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total number of bananas} = 10 \times 4 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if she had bought bananas individually.
Each banana costs $0.80.

\[
\text{Cost per bunch} = \$3.00
\]

Since there are 10 bunches, we calculate the total cost for all bunches:

\[
\text{Total cost for bunches} = \text{Number of bunches} \times \text{Cost per bunch}
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
\text{Total cost for bunches} = 10 \times \$3.00 = \$30.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost if she had bought bananas individually.
If she had bought bananas individually, she would have paid $0.80 per banana.

\[
\text{Total cost for individual purchase} = \text{Total number of bananas} \times \text{Price per banana}
\]

Substitute the calculated value from Step 1 and the given price:

\[
\text{Total cost for individual purchase} = 40 \times \$0.80 = \$32.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the savings.
Subtract the total cost of the bunches from the total cost of the individual purchase to find her savings.

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost for individual purchase} - \text{Total cost for bunches}
\]

Substitute the calculated values:

\[
\text{Savings} = \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00
\]

### Final Answer:
Jenny saved **$2.00** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.<|im_end|>","Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam gets from the total length of 100 feet.

Step 1: Define variables.
Let \( S \) be the length of the fence that Sam receives.
Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's share would be \( S + 60 \).

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the total length of the fence.
Sam's share plus Harry's share equals the total length of the fence:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Step 4: Solve for \( S \).
Subtract 60 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S = 40 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.

Step 5: Calculate how much is left over for Sam.
Since the total length of the fence is 100 feet and Sam has already received 20 feet, the remaining length for Sam is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]<|im_end|>","Let x be the amount of fence Sam gets and y be the amount Harry gets. We know that y = x + 60, and y + x = 100.

We divide each side by two, leaving x=20. This means Sam has 20 feet of fence left over.

- The crocodile grows 8 inches over 4 years.
- To find the annual growth rate, divide the total growth (8 inches) by the number of years (4).
  
\[
\text{Annual Growth Rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches/year}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total growth over 13 years**
- Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches every year, we can multiply this yearly growth rate by the number of years (13).

\[
\text{Total Growth Over 13 Years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of bike sold.
- Total bikes sold = 300
- Half of these are Trekking bikes (since 15% are BMX bikes).
\[ \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 \]

Since there are only three types of bikes (MTB, BMX, and Trekking), the remaining bikes must be either BMX or MTB.
\[ \text{Total bikes not Trekking} = 300 - 150 = 150 \]
So, out of the 150 non-Trekking bikes, 15% are BMX bikes.
\[ \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 150 = 22.5 \approx 23 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a bike in practice, let's round up to the nearest whole number, but since the original numbers suggest no rounding was needed for the exact count, we'll assume the initial calculation was correct without rounding.
\[ \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 23 \]

This leaves us with the remaining bikes being MTB.
\[ \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 150 - 23 = 127 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the earnings from each type of bike.
- Price of one MTB = $500
- Price of one BMX = $\frac{1}{2}$ of $500 = $250
- Price of one Trekking = $450

Now, calculate the total earnings from each type of bike.
\[ \text{Earnings from MTB} = 127 \times \$500 = \$63,500 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from BMX} = 23 \times \$250 = \$5,750 \]
\[ \text{Earnings from Trekking} = 150 \times \$450 = \$67,500 \]

### Step 3: Sum up all the earnings.
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$63,500 + \$5,750 + \$67,500 = \$137,750 \]

Therefore, the amount Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month is:
\[ \boxed{\$137,750} \]<|im_end|>","First, let's calculate the price of the BMX bike which is half of the price of one MTB, so it's 500 * 0.5 = $<<500*0.5=250>>250.
Half of the sold bikes were Trekking bikes, which means 300 * 0.5 = <<300*0.5=150>>150 bikes.
15% of the sold bikes were BMX bikes, which means 300 * 15/100 = <<300*15/100=45>>45 bikes.
The remaining bicycles sold were of the MTB type and there were 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 bikes of this type sold.
That means Marcel earned 150 * 450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500 from Trekking bikes.
He also earned 45 * 250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250 from BMX bikes.
MTB bikes got him 105 * 500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500
In total Marcel earned 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 during that month.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total number of bales made by the farmer over 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer will make \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Calculate the total number of bales picked up by the truck over 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck will pick up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Subtract the number of bales picked up from the total number of bales made:**
   - The total number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up equals the number of bales remaining in the field.
   - Therefore, the number of bales remaining is \( 30 - 18 = 12 \).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine how much time John spends learning per week, we'll break down the problem into several steps.

**Step 1: Calculate total daily class time**

John takes 2 extra classes per day. Each class lasts 40 minutes.
\[ \text{Total daily class time} = 2 \times 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total daily class time} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Calculate total weekly class time**

There are 6 periods in a regular day and John takes 2 extra classes every day.
\[ \text{Total weekly class time} = (6 + 2) \times 80 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly class time} = 8 \times 80 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly class time} = 640 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 3: Convert total weekly class time to hours**

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
\[ \text{Total weekly class time in hours} = \frac{640}{60} \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly class time in hours} = \frac{640}{60} \approx 10.67 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Determine additional learning time**

John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly class time on Saturdays and Sundays.
\[ \text{Additional learning time} = \frac{1}{16} \times 640 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Additional learning time} = \frac{640}{16} \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Additional learning time} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 5: Add additional learning time to total weekly class time**

\[ \text{Total weekly learning time} = \text{Total weekly class time} + \text{Additional learning time} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly learning time} = 640 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly learning time} = 680 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 6: Convert total weekly learning time back to hours**

\[ \text{Total weekly learning time in hours} = \frac{680}{60} \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Total weekly learning time in hours} = \frac{680}{60} \approx 11.33 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, John spends approximately **11.33 hours a week learning**.<|im_end|>","He takes 6+2=<<6+2=8>>8 classes a day

That means he spends 1600/16=<<1600/16=100>>100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday
So he spends 1600+100+100=<<1600+100+100=1800>>1800 minutes per week

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the initial drop height**: 
   - Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony.
   - Each story is 24 feet tall.
   - The number of stories (n) can be calculated as: n = floor(3 / 24), since we're considering the total height of all stories up to the balcony.

   \[
   n = \left\lfloor \frac{3}{24} \right\rfloor = 0
   \]

   Since there are no stories above the balcony level, we need to consider only the height of the balcony itself.

   \[
   \text{Initial drop height} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height after the first bounce**:
   - After the first bounce, the ball reaches 2/3 of its previous height.
   
   \[
   \text{Height after first bounce} = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height after the second bounce**:
   - After the second bounce, the ball again reaches 2/3 of its previous height.

   \[
   \text{Height after second bounce} = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the ball goes \(32\) feet high on its second bounce. 

**The final answer is:**  
The final answer is: 32.<|im_end|>","First find the total height from which Nathan drops the ball: 24 feet/story * 3 stories = <<24*3=72>>72 feet

To find out how tall the fourth child is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the height of the second child:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.

2. **Calculate the height of the second child in inches:**
   - Convert the height of the first child from feet to inches (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Add the extra two inches for the second child:
     \[
     72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}

5. **Determine the height of the fourth child:**
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.

6. **Calculate the height of the fourth child in inches:**
   - Add three inches to the height of the third child:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how many bags were sold.
- We know that there are 2000 apples and each bag contains 10 apples.
- To find out how many bags were sold, divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} \]

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from selling the bags.
- Each bag is sold for $5.
- Multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to get the total earnings.

\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of bags}) \times (\text{Price per bag}) \]

Let's perform these calculations:

Step 1:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the meat remaining after different creatures have eaten.

1. **Identify the total amount of meat eaten by the T-rex:**
   - The T-rex ate half of a small triceratops.
   
2. **Determine how much meat was left after the T-rex:**
   - After the T-rex ate its share, there was a certain amount of meat left for the other creatures to eat.
   
3. **Calculate the amount of meat left for the velociraptors:**
   - The velociraptors ate half of what was left.
   
4. **Identify the amount of meat that remained after the velociraptors:**
   - The rest of the meat went to the Allosaurus.
   
5. **Calculate the total amount of meat eaten by the T-rex and the velociraptors together:**
   - Add the meat eaten by the T-rex and the velociraptors to find out how much was left before the Allosaurus arrived.
   
6. **Subtract the meat eaten by the Allosaurus from the total amount of meat available initially:**
   - This will give us the initial amount of meat on the triceratops.

Let's do these steps one by one:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total meat eaten by the T-rex (half of the triceratops):**
   Let \( x \) be the total weight of the triceratops' meat. So, the T-rex ate \( \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **Remaining meat after the T-rex:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining meat after the T-rex} = x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. **Meat eaten by the velociraptors:**
   The velociraptors ate half of what was left after the T-rex:
   \[
   \text{Meat eaten by velociraptors} = \frac{\frac{x}{2}}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
   So, the remaining meat after the velociraptors would be:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

4. **Meat remaining for the Allosaurus:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining meat for the Allosaurus} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

5. **Total meat eaten by the T-rex, velociraptors, and Allosaurus:**
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = x
   \]

6. **Initial amount of meat on the triceratops:**
   According to the problem, the Allosaurus ate 270 kg of the remaining meat, so:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 2 = 540 \text{ kg}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 540 kg.<|im_end|>","The velociraptors left half for the Allosaurus, so the T-Rex left 2 * 270 = <<2*270=540>>540 kilograms of meat.

To determine the cost to paint the room, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall.
- **North and South Walls**:
  - Length = 10 feet
  - Width = 8 feet
  - Area = Length × Width = 10 feet × 8 feet = 80 square feet (since there are two such walls)

- **East and West Walls**:
  - Length = 5 feet
  - Width = 8 feet
  - Area = Length × Width = 5 feet × 8 feet = 40 square feet (since there are two such walls)

### Step 2: Sum up the total area of all the walls.
- Total area for North/South Walls = 80 square feet
- Total area for East/West Walls = 40 square feet
- Total area for all walls = 80 + 40 = 120 square feet

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed.
- Each gallon covers 20 square feet.
- Number of gallons required = Total area / Coverage per gallon = 120 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 6 gallons

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost based on the number of gallons needed.
- Cost per gallon = $12
- Total cost = Number of gallons × Cost per gallon = 6 gallons × $12/gallon = $72

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \boxed{72}.<|im_end|>","The north and south walls are 80 square feet each because 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that Ellen's friend ends up getting sprayed with soda after Ellen's actions and subsequent events. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of sodas.
Ellen starts with a case containing 12 sodas.

### Step 2: Account for the sodas that were shaken.
She shakes 3 sodas, leaving 9 sodas in total (12 - 3 = 9).

### Step 3: Account for the sodas that are not shaken but taken by Ellen.
Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, so there are now 8 unshaken sodas remaining (9 - 1 = 8).

### Step 4: Calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed.
Ellen's friend arrives and takes 2 of the unshaken sodas. The probability that Ellen's friend does not get sprayed depends on whether or not they take any of the 3 shaken sodas.

- If Ellen's friend takes all 3 shaken sodas, then no soda will be sprayed because the friend already has 3 sodas.
- If Ellen's friend only takes 1 unshaken soda, then that soda is guaranteed to be sprayed.
- If Ellen's friend takes 2 unshaken sodas, then those sodas are also guaranteed to be sprayed.

Since the friend can either take 0, 1, or 2 unshaken sodas, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. **Friend takes 0 unshaken sodas**:
   - Friend has 2 unshaken sodas.
   - Probability = \( \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \)

2. **Friend takes 1 unshaken soda**:
   - Friend has 1 unshaken soda.
   - Probability = \( \frac{1}{8} \)

3. **Friend takes 2 unshaken sodas**:
   - Friend has 0 unshaken sodas.
   - Probability = \( \frac{7}{8} \)

Now, we sum these probabilities to find the overall probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed.

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = P(0 unshaken) + P(1 unshaken) + P(2 unshaken)
\]

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{7}{8} \right)
\]

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8}
\]

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8}
\]

Convert all fractions to have a common denominator:

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8}
\]

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{2 + 1 + 7}{8}
\]

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{10}{8}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25
\]

This result seems incorrect since probabilities should be between 0 and 1. Let’s re-evaluate the steps:

- Friend taking 0 unshaken sodas: \(\frac{1}{4}\)
- Friend taking 1 unshaken soda: \(\frac{1}{8}\)
- Friend taking 2 unshaken sodas: \(\frac{7}{8}\)

Summing these gives the correct probability:

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{10}{8} = 1.25
\]

This indicates an error in calculation. Let's correct it:

\[
P(\text{friend sprays}) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{10}{8} = 1.25
\","First figure out how many unshaken sodas were in the case when Ellen left the room: 12 total sodas - 3 shaken sodas - 1 taken soda = <<12-3-1=8>>8 unshaken sodas.
Next, figure out how many unshaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 unshaken sodas.
Then figure out how many shaken sodas were left after Ellen's brother came: 3 - 1 = <<3-1=2>>2 shaken sodas.
Now add the number of shaken and unshaken sodas to find the total number of sodas left when Ellen's friend came along: 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 sodas
Now divide the number of shaken sodas by the total number of sodas to find the decimal probability Ellen's friend gets sprayed: 2/8 = <<2/8=0.25>>0.25
Now multiply the decimal probability by 100 to express it as a percentage: .25 * 100 = <<.25*100=25>>25%

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the speed of each train**:
   - The first train travels at 60 miles per hour.
   - The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, which means it travels at \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the total distance covered by both trains in 3 hours**:
   - Distance covered by the first train: \( 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
   - Distance covered by the second train: \( 30 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Sum the distances to find the total distance between them**:
   - Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours: \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{270}
\]<|im_end|>","Since one train is traveling half the speed of the train traveling 60 miles an hour, that means that train is traveling 60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 miles an hour.

This means that in 3 hours they will have traveled 90*3= <<90*3=270>>270 miles away from each other.

To determine how many people Billy helps over the given period, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days Billy works.
2. Determine how many days he takes off.
3. Calculate the number of people he helps based on his work schedule.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Billy works**

- The total number of days from March 1st to April 19th is 31 days.
- Billy takes 20% of these days off. So, he takes \(31 \times 20\% = 6.2\) days off. Since he cannot take a fraction of a day off, we round this down to 6 days.
  
Therefore, the number of days he works is \(31 - 6 = 25\) days.

**Step 2: Determine how many days he takes off**

Billy takes 6 days off during the month.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of people he helps**

- Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
- Therefore, he can help \(2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}\).

Since he works for 25 days, the total number of people he helps is \(25 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ people/day} = 150 \text{ people}\).

So, Billy helps **150 people** throughout the month.<|im_end|>","First find the number of days between March 1st and April 19th: 31 days + 19 days = <<31+19=50>>50 days

Then multiply that number by 80% to find the number of days Billy works: 50 days * 80% = <<50*80*.01=40>>40 days
Then find how many people Billy can help per day: 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = <<2*3=6>>6 people/day

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people were in the church after the wedding ceremony. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of passengers per vehicle type.
- **Private Cars**:
  - Each car carries 3 people.

  Number of cars = 20

  Total passengers from cars = \( 20 \times 3 \)

- **Buses**:
  - Each bus carries 35 people.

  Number of buses = 12

  Total passengers from buses = \( 12 \times 35 \)

### Step 2: Perform the calculations for passengers from cars.
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 people in the church from the private cars.

### Step 3: Perform the calculation for passengers from buses.
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

So, there are 420 people in the church from the buses.

### Step 4: Add the total number of passengers from both vehicles together.
\[ 60 + 420 = 480 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who were inside the church after the ceremony was **480**.<|im_end|>","There were 20 private cars * 3 people = <<20*3=60>>60 people.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine Martha's age
We know that Mike is 24 years old.
Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.

\[ \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 \]

Substitute Mike's age into the equation:

\[ \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 \]
\[ \text{Martha's age} = 20 \]

So, Martha is 20 years old.

### Step 2: Determine Jeff's age
Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 \]

Substitute Martha's age into the equation:

\[ \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Jeff's age} = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time taken for each slide based on their lengths and speeds.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the biggest slide
- Length of the biggest slide = 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide = 60 feet per minute

\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time for the biggest slide} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the second biggest slide
- Length of the second biggest slide = 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide = 80 feet per minute

\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{\text{Length}}{\text{Speed}} \]

\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time for the second biggest slide} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Compare the times
Now, we compare the two times:

- Time for the biggest slide = 5 minutes
- Time for the second biggest slide = 3 minutes

Difference in time = Time for the biggest slide - Time for the second biggest slide

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} \]

\[ \text{Difference in time} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

### Conclusion
It takes 2 more minutes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks over 5 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on lunch in one day.
- Lunch duration: 30 minutes
- Number of days: 5

Total lunch time = Lunch duration × Number of days
= 30 minutes/day × 5 days
= 150 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on breaks in one day.
- Break duration: 2 * 15 minutes (since there are two 15-minute breaks)
- Number of days: 5

Total break time = Break duration × Number of days
= 2 * 15 minutes/break × 5 days
= 30 minutes/day × 5 days
= 150 minutes

Step 3: Add the total lunch and break times together.
Total time spent = Total lunch time + Total break time
= 150 minutes + 150 minutes
= 300 minutes

Step 4: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Step 2: Calculate the distance Ahito ran.
We know that the total distance run by all three is 52 miles. So, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:
\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card after all transactions, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the refund from the return**
Sheila initially returned an item costing $15.00.
Refund = $15.00

**Step 2: Subtract the refunded amount from the original charge**
Original charge = $85.00
New total before any other charges or deductions = $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

**Step 3: Calculate the price of the frying pan after the discount**
Frying pan originally costs $20.00 but is on sale at 20% off.
Discounted price of frying pan = Original price × (1 - Discount rate)
= $20.00 × (1 - 0.20) = $20.00 × 0.80 = $16.00

**Step 4: Add the price of the frying pan to the remaining balance**
Remaining balance after refund = $70.00
Price of frying pan after discount = $16.00
Total after adding the frying pan purchase = Remaining balance + Frying pan purchase

**Step 5: Calculate the price of the towel set after the discount**
Towel set originally costs $30.00 but is on sale at 10% off.
Discounted price of towel set = Original price × (1 - Discount rate)

**Step 6: Add the price of the towel set to the current total**
Current total after adding the frying pan purchase = $86.00
Price of towel set after discount = $27.00
Final total after adding the towel set purchase = Current total + Towel set purchase

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

2. **Determine Large Jellyfish:**
   Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5}x = \text{Number of large jellyfish}
   \]

3. **Determine Large Jellyfish That Change Color:**
   Out of these large jellyfish, a third change color when exposed to UV light. Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{1}{5}x\right) = \text{Number of large jellyfish that change color}
   \]
   Simplifying this expression gives us:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{1}{15}x
   \]

4. **Set Up Equation for Number of Changed Jellyfish:**
   According to the problem, 6 jellyfish changed color. So:
   \[
   \frac{1}{15}x = 6
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), multiply both sides by 15:
   \[
   x = 6 \times 15

   Calculate the right side:
   \[
   x = 90

                    question:
                    Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck. How many more years does ! Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years, live with 40% of ? her current annual salary, and her current salary is $100,000?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Lauren to reach her goal of saving enough money for retirement based on her current savings rate and her desired retirement plan.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **1. Calculate Lauren's monthly savings:**

Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck. Her current annual salary is $100,000.

First, calculate her monthly salary:
\[ \text{Monthly Salary} = \frac{\$100,000}{12} = \$8,333.33 \]

Next, calculate her monthly savings:
\[ \text{Monthly Savings} = 0.20 \times \$8,333.33 = \$1,666.67 \]

#### **2. Determine Lauren's total savings needed for retirement over 20 years:**

Lauren wants to live off 40% of her current annual salary during her working years. Therefore, her living expenses per year would be:
\[ \text{Living Expenses Per Year} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000 \]

Over 20 years, her total living expenses would be:
\[ \text{Total Living Expenses Over 20 Years} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \]

This amount needs to be saved in addition to her regular savings.

#### **3. Calculate the total amount Lauren needs to save:**

Lauren’s total savings should cover both her living expenses and her planned future savings. Let \( S \) represent the total amount she needs to save over time.

Since her savings rate is 20%, let \( P \) represent her initial principal (which includes her living expenses).

Given that her living expenses alone require an additional $800,000, her savings must cover these costs plus whatever else she aims to accumulate. We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ P + S = \$800,000 \]

We know that Lauren's savings rate is 20%. If she saves $S$, then her yearly savings are:
\[ S = P \times 0.20 \]

Substituting into the previous equation gives us:
\[ P + P \times 0.20 = \$800,000 \]
\[ P(1 + 0.20) = \$800,000 \]
\[ P \times 1.20 = \$800,000 \]
\[ P = \frac{\$800,000}{1.20} \]
\[ P = \$666,666.67 \]

So, Lauren needs to save approximately \$666,666.67 per year.

#### **4. Calculate the number of years required to save this amount at a 20% savings rate:**

Now we have the formula for the number of years required to save a given amount:
\[ T = \frac{P}{S} \]
where \( P = \$666,666.67 \) and \( S = \$1,666.67 \).

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
\[ T = \frac{\$666,666.67}{\$1,666.67/\text{year}} \]
\[ T = 400 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for **400 years** to save enough for her retirement. 

### Conclusion:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]<|im_end|>","Lauren plans to live in retirement with 40% of her current salary ($100,000), therefore 40%*$100,000 = $<<40*.01*100000=40000>>40,000
If she wants to save for 20 years, then she will need to save 20 * $40,000 = $<<20*40000=800000>>800,000 to retire
If her current salary is $100,00 and she's saving 20%, then she's able to save $100,000 * 20% = $<<100000*20*.01=20000>>20,000 every year
To reach her desired savings goal ($800,000) she will need to work for another $800,000/$20,000 = <<800000/20000=40>>40 years

                    question:
                    Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. , How long will , each : final cut be?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the length of each final part after cutting the ribbon, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of cuts needed.
Marty needs to cut his ribbon into 4 equal parts first.

- Cutting once divides the ribbon into 2 parts.
- Cutting again divides one of those parts further into 2 more parts.
- This process continues until there are 4 pieces.

So, the number of cuts required is:
\[ \text{Number of cuts} = \log_2(4) = 2 \]

Each cut increases the number of segments by 1 (e.g., from 1 segment to 2 segments).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cuts made.
After making 2 cuts, we have 3 cuts left to divide each of the 4 parts into smaller parts.

- Each of the 4 parts is then divided into 5 smaller parts.
- Therefore, for each of the 4 parts, there are \(5\) divisions.

So, the number of additional cuts is:
\[ \text{Additional cuts} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

### Step 3: Total number of cuts.
Adding the initial 2 cuts to the additional 20 cuts gives us:
\[ \text{Total cuts} = 2 + 20 = 22 \]

### Step 4: Length calculation per cut.
Since the original length of the ribbon is 100 cm, each cut results in an increase of:
\[ \frac{100}{22} \approx 4.545 \text{ cm} \]

This means that each cut adds approximately 4.545 cm to the length of the remaining piece.

### Final Answer:
Each final cut will be approximately **4.545 cm** long.<|im_end|>","The 100-centimeter ribbon is cut into 4 equal parts in pieces of 100 / 4 = <<100/4=25>>25 cm

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students in the school:**

   We know that 40% of the school's population consists of 240 boys.

   Let \( T \) represent the total number of students in the school.

   Given that 40% of \( T \) equals 240 boys, we can set up the equation:
   
   \[
   0.40T = 240
   \]

2. **Solve for \( T \):**
   
   To find \( T \), divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:
   
   \[
   T = \frac{240}{0.40}
   \]
   
   Simplify the division:
   
   \[
   T = 600
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls:**

   Since 40% of the school population is boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

   The number of girls in the school is given by:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 0.60 \times T
   \]
   
   Substitute \( T = 600 \):
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 0.60 \times 600
   \]
   
   Perform the multiplication:
   
   \[
   \text{Number of Girls} = 360

                    question:
                    Although Soledad works . in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of , June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days Soledad has available for hiking.
Soledad plans to take a vacation for the entire month of June, which typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Total days} = 30 \]

### Step 2: Determine the total distance Soledad wants to cover.
She aims to hike 9,300 miles in total during her vacation.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of miles Soledad can currently cover per trip.
Each day, she hikes 125 miles.

\[ \text{Miles per trip} = 125 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of trips Soledad will make in one month.
Since there are 30 days in June and she hiked 125 miles each day, we need to find out how many trips she can make in 30 days.

\[ \text{Trips} = \frac{\text{Total days}}{\text{Days per trip}} \]

Let’s assume she makes one trip every day (since it doesn't specify otherwise).

\[ \text{Trips} = \frac{30}{1} = 30 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of miles Soledad can already cover.
If she covers 125 miles per trip and she makes 30 trips,

\[ \text{Total covered miles} = 125 \times 30 \]

Let's do this calculation first:

\[ 125 \times 30 = 3750 \]

### Step 6: Determine how many more miles Soledad still needs to cover.
Subtract the miles she can already cover from the total miles she aims to cover.

\[ \text{Remaining miles} = 9300 - 3750 \]

Now, calculate this:

\[ 9300 - 3750 = 5550 \]

### Step 7: Calculate the average number of miles Soledad should hike per day.
She wants to hike twice a day, so we divide the remaining miles by 2.

\[ \text{Daily mileage} = \frac{\text{Remaining miles}}{\text{Number of days per trip}} \]

Since she hikes twice a day, we'll use 2 as the divisor.

\[ \text{Daily mileage} = \frac{5550}{2} \]

Let's perform this division:

\[ \frac{5550}{2} = 2775 \]

### Conclusion:
Soledad needs to hike **2775 miles per day** to complete her journey on time. This means she should increase her daily mileage by 2775 miles beyond what she is currently doing. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2775}

**Step 2: Determine the price for each type of ball**
- Red balls cost $9 each.
- Blue balls cost $5 each.
- Green balls cost $3 each.

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from each type of ball**
- Revenue from red balls = Number of red balls × Price per red ball = 3 × $9 = $27
- Revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls × Price per blue ball = 11 × $5 = $55
- Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls × Price per green ball = 25 × $3 = $75

**Step 4: Sum up the revenues to get the total amount received**
Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the apples Pierre, Paul, and Jacques want, then calculate how much they take together, and finally find out how much is left for James.

Step 1: Determine the amount Pierre wants.
Pierre wants a quarter of the total apples. Since there are 12 kg of apples in total, Pierre wants:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Step 2: Determine the amount Paul wants.
Paul wants one-third of the total apples. Therefore, Paul wants:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}

Step 3: Calculate the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul.
Together, Pierre and Paul want:

\[
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ kg}

Step 4: Subtract the total amount taken from the original quantity.
Since there were originally 12 kg of apples, after Pierre and Paul took their share, the remaining amount is:

\[
12 - (3 + 4) = 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ kg}

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine how much money Raymond has after saving.
Raymond initially has $21. He saves an additional $11 from his allowance.

Calculation:
$21 + $11 = $32

So far, Raymond has $32 in total.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the items Raymond purchased.
He spends $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle.

                    question:
                    . Anna is trying to buy books for her local library. ; She had a budget ? of $16, and she has already spent $4. She also bought 2 books today, and both books cost ! her the same ! amount of money. ; If Anna has $2 left in her budget, how much did each of the books cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total amount spent so far.
Anna started with a budget of $16 and has already spent $4. So, we subtract these amounts from her initial budget.

Total spent = Initial budget - Amount spent so far
Total spent = $16 - $4
Total spent = $12

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget after buying the books.
After spending $4 on two identical books, Anna still has $2 left in her budget.

Remaining budget = Total budget - Amount spent on books
$2 = $16 - Amount spent on books

### Step 3: Find out how much was spent on one book.
Since Anna bought two books that cost the same amount, we can divide the total amount spent on books by 2 to find the price per book.

Amount spent on one book = (Total amount spent on books / Number of books)
Amount spent on one book = ($12 / 2)
Amount spent on one book = $6

### Final Answer:
Each book costs $6.<|im_end|>","Anna had already spent some money, so she started the day with $16 – $4 = $<<16-4=12>>12.
She has money left in the budget, so she spent a total of $12 – $2 = $<<12-2=10>>10 on the books.
Therefore each book cost her $10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of students who will be added to last year's enrollment.
2. Add that number to last year's total enrollment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students added this year.

Last year's enrollment = 50 students
Increase percentage = 20%

Number of students added this year = (20/100) * 50

Let's do the calculation for the number of students added this year:

\[ \text{Number of students added} = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 new students have been added to the class.

Step 2: Add the number of students added to last year's enrollment.

This year's total enrollment = Last year's enrollment + Number of students added

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{This year's total enrollment} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, this year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times given that it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of blinks per minute**

First, let's find out how many times the light blinks per minute. We know that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. Therefore:

\[ \text{Number of blinks per minute} = \frac{\text{Total blinks}}{\text{Minutes}} = \frac{255}{5} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \frac{255}{5} = 51 \]

So, the light blinks 51 times every minute.

**Step 2: Calculate the time required for 459 blinks**

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times. Since we know that it blinks 51 times per minute, we can set up a proportion to find the total time \( T \) in minutes:

\[ \frac{51 \text{ blinks}}{T \text{ minutes}} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{X \text{ minutes}} \]

We can simplify this equation as follows:

\[ 51T = 459X \]

To isolate \( T \), we divide both sides by 51:

\[ T = \frac{459X}{51} \]

Since \( X \) represents the total time (in minutes), and we already know that \( T \) should be the same as \( X \):

\[ T = \frac{459}{51} \]

Let's calculate this value:

\[ \frac{459}{51} = 9 \]

Therefore, it would take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

To determine how many more female fish there are compared to male fish in Tate's garden pond after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count the initial number of female and male fish:**
   - Male guppies: 4
   - Female guppies: 7
   - Male goldfishes: 3
   - Female goldfishes: 5

2. **Calculate the total number of female and male fish before any purchase:**
   - Total female fish = Female guppies + Female goldfishes = 7 + 5 = 12
   - Total male fish = Male guppies + Male goldfishes = 4 + 3 = 7

3. **Add the new fish purchased to the totals:**
   - New male guppies: 2
   - New female guppy: 1
   - New male goldfishes: 2
   - New female goldfishes: 3

4. **Update the counts after the purchase:**
   - Updated male guppies = Initial male guppies + New male guppies = 4 + 2 = 6
   - Updated female guppies = Initial female guppies + New female guppy = 7 + 1 = 8
   - Updated male goldfishes = Initial male goldfishes + New male goldfishes = 3 + 2 = 5
   - Updated female goldfishes = Initial female goldfishes + New female goldfishes = 5 + 3 = 8

5. **Determine the difference between the updated numbers of female and male fish:**
   - Difference in females = Updated female guppies - Updated male guppies = 8 - 6 = 2
   - Difference in males = Updated male guppies - Updated male goldfishes = 6 - 5 = 1

6. **Find the net change (difference) in the number of female fish relative to male fish:**
   - Net change = Difference in females - Difference in males = 2 - 1 = 1

Therefore, Tate has \boxed{1} more female fish than male fish.<|im_end|>","Tate has a total of 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.

<|im_start|>super
To calculate the total time taken by Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their respective chores, we need to determine how long each one spent on their assigned tasks.

1. **Amalia's Task:**
   - Amalia's task is to mow the lawn.
   - It takes her 4 hours to complete this chore.

2. **Megan's Task:**
   - Megan has to walk the dog.
   - This task takes her 2 hours longer than Amalia's 4-hour mowing session.
   
   \[
   \text{Time for Megan} = \text{Time for Amalia} + 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   
   Therefore,
   
   \[
   \text{Time for Megan} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Dior's Task:**
   - Dior needs to do laundry.
   - This task takes more than 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn.

   \[
   \text{Time for Dior} > 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

Let's denote the additional time Dior spends doing laundry as \( T_D \). Given that \( T_D > 4 \) hours:

\[
T_D > 4 \text{ hours}
\]

We can express \( T_D \) in terms of hours:

\[
T_D = 5 \text{ hours}, \quad \text{or} \quad T_D = 6 \text{ hours}, \quad \text{etc.}
\]

Since no specific value for \( T_D \) is provided, let’s assume \( T_D \geq 5 \text{ hours} \).

Therefore, if Dior spends at least 5 hours doing laundry:

\[
\text{Total Time for Dior} = 4 \text{ hours (mowing)} + 5 \text{ hours (laundry)}
\]

Now summing up the times for all three individuals:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 9 hours (assuming \( T_D = 5 \text{ hours} \))

\[
\text{Total Time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

\[

To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent driving per visit:**
   - The given ratio for one way is 2 hours.
   - Since John makes two visits a month, the total time spent driving per month is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.

2. **Convert the total time from hours to minutes:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, \(4\) hours is equivalent to \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.

3. **Determine the distance traveled during one round trip:**
   - Speed (in miles per hour) is given as 70 mph.
   - Time taken for one round trip is 2 hours.
   - Distance can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}

   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total distance driven over all visits:**
   - John makes two visits per month.
   - Each visit involves a round trip of 140 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance driven per month is:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 2 \times 140 \text{ miles} = 280 \text{ miles}

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in one day:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

3. **Determine Daily Distance for Each Person:**
   We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day:
   \[
   S = 10 \text{ miles/day}

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys each worker produces in one hour and then find out how many toys the fifth worker produces. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine total production capacity

We know that there are 400 toys needed and they have 10 hours to complete them.

Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the third group of workers (each producing 4 toys/hour).

So, the equation representing the total production is:
\[ 4x = 20 \]
This means each of these two workers can produce 5 toys per hour because:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

### Step 2: Calculate remaining toys after initial production

After these three groups work for 10 hours:
- The first two groups together will produce:
\[ 2 \times 6 + 2 \times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys} \]

Thus, the remaining number of toys is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \]

### Step 3: Determine remaining time for the fifth worker

Since the fifth worker works continuously throughout the 10-hour period, they would also contribute to the production. Let’s denote the number of toys produced by the fifth worker as \( y \). 

The total number of toys produced by the fifth worker over the 10 hours must cover the remaining 380 toys:
\[ 10y = 380 \]
Solving for \( y \):
\[ y = \frac{380}{10} = 38 \]

### Conclusion

Therefore, the fifth worker produces **38 toys per hour**.<|im_end|>","In the first group of workers, each produces 6 toys * 10 hours = <<6*10=60>>60 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 60 toys * 2 workers = <<60*2=120>>120 toys.
In the second group of workers, each produces 4 toys * 10 hours = <<4*10=40>>40 toys over their shift.
This is a total of 40 toys * 2 workers = <<40*2=80>>80 toys.
Together, these two groups produce 120 + 80 = <<120+80=200>>200 toys.
If the order is still short, then all the workers combined have produced 400 ordered toys – 20 remaining toys = <<400-20=380>>380 toys.
This means the fifth worker produced 380 – 200 = <<380-200=180>>180 toys in total.
The fifth worker therefore produced 180 toys / 10 hours = <<180/10=18>>18 toys per hour.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Let's break this down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
First, let's define some variables to represent the weights of Elijah's dogs.
- Let \( E_d \) be the weight of Elijah's first dog.
- Let \( K_d \) be the weight of Kory's dog.

### Step 2: Establish Relationships
We know two things about these relationships:
1. Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
2. Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.

From these relationships, we can write equations for the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ E_d = \frac{K_d}{4} \]
\[ E_d = \frac{K_d}{2} \]

Since both expressions equal \( E_d \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ \frac{K_d}{4} = \frac{K_d}{2} \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( K_d \)
To solve for \( K_d \), we need to eliminate the fractions. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{K_d}{4} = 2 \cdot \frac{K_d}{2} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{K_d}{2} = \frac{K_d}{2} \]

This equation is true for any value of \( K_d \). However, since the problem states that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can substitute \( K_d = 60 \) into our original relationship to find \( E_d \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Weight of Elijah's Dogs
Using the relationship between Elijah's dogs:
\[ E_d = \frac{K_d}{2} \]
Substitute \( K_d = 60 \):
\[ E_d = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 30 pounds, and his second dog also weighs 30 pounds (since it is half the weight of Kory's dog).

### Step 5: Sum the Weights
Now, let's sum up the weights of both dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight} = E_d + K_d \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 30 + 60 = 90 \]

### Final Answer
Therefore, the total weight of Elijah's dogs together is **90 pounds**.<|im_end|>","Elijah’s first dog is 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pounds
Elijah’s second dog is 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 pounds
The total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs is 15 + 30 + 60 = <<15+30+60=105>>105 pounds

                    question:
                    Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. . Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.  Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth . have in the beginning?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Identify the total number of stickers that Kris received from Seth:**
   - We know that after giving away some stickers, Kris has 7 stickers left.
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of stickers Seth had initially.

2. **Determine how many stickers Seth gave to Luis:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   - Therefore, the number of stickers given to Luis is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the number of stickers left with Seth after giving to Luis:**
   - After giving half to Luis, Seth has \( x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} \) stickers left.

4. **Determine how many stickers Luis used:**
   - Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth.
   - Since he used half, he must have \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) stickers.

5. **Calculate the number of stickers left with Luis after using them:**
   - After using half, Luis has \( \frac{x}{4} \) stickers left.

6. **Determine how many stickers Luis gave to Kris:**
   - Luis gave the rest of his stickers to Kris.
   - The number of stickers Luis gave to Kris is \( \frac{x}{4} \).

7. **Calculate the number of stickers left with Luis after giving to Kris:**
   - After giving to Kris, Luis has \( \frac{x}{4} - \frac{x}{4} = 0 \) stickers left (since he only has the stickers he didn't give to Kris).

8. **Since we know the number of stickers left with Luis (which is zero), we can now determine the initial number of stickers Seth had:**
   - If Luis had no stickers left after receiving from Seth, then the stickers he got were exactly those he needed.
   - So, the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis was equal to the number of stickers left with him after giving to Luis, which is 7 stickers.

Therefore, the total number of stickers Seth had at first is:
\[ x = 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

**Final Answer:** The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Luis gave 9 + 7 = <<9+7=16>>16 stickers to Kris.
Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris which means that he had 16 x 2 = <<16*2=32>>32 stickers.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how many small bags John can fill with 10 M&Ms per bag, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of M&Ms John has.
John buys 3 large bags, and each large bag weighs 10 ounces.

First, calculate the total weight of all three large bags:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 3 \times 10 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, convert this total weight into the number of M&Ms. Since there are 30 M&Ms in one ounce, the total number of M&Ms is:
\[ \text{Total M&Ms} = 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms/ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

### Step 2: Determine how many small bags John can pack with 10 M&Ms per bag.
John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many such bags he can make from his total M&Ms, divide the total number of M&Ms by the number that fits in each small bag:
\[ \text{Number of small bags} = \frac{\text{Total M&Ms}}{\text{M&Ms per small bag}} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

Thus, John can make 90 small bags with 10 M&Ms each.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]<|im_end|>","He bought 3*10=<<3*10=30>>30 ounces of M&M

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many days it would take for Alfie to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance that equals half the circumference of the Earth:**
   - The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers.
   - Half of this distance is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40,000 = 20,000 \) kilometers.

2. **Determine the total number of days Alfie needs to fly:**
   - Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.
   - To find out how many days he needs to cover 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by his daily flight distance:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}}
     \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{20,000}{400} = 50
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the way around the Earth.

Therefore, the final answer is: $\boxed{50}$ days.<|im_end|>","Half of 40,000 kilometers is 40,000/2=<<40000/2=20000>>20,000 kilometers.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( L \) represent Liam's current age.
Let \( V \) represent Vince's current age.

Given that Liam is currently 16 years old, we can write:
\[ L = 16 \]

### Step 2: Express the Age Difference in Terms of Ages
Two years ago, Liam's age was \( L - 2 \).

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age at that time. Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
\[ L - 2 = 2(V - 2) \]

### Step 3: Substitute Liam's Current Age into the Equation
Substitute \( L = 16 \) into the equation:
\[ 16 - 2 = 2(V - 2) \]

Simplify:
\[ 14 = 2(V - 2) \]

### Step 4: Solve for Vince's Current Age
Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( V - 2 \):
\[ \frac{14}{2} = V - 2 \]
\[ 7 = V - 2 \]

Add 2 to both sides to solve for \( V \):
\[ 7 + 2 = V \]
\[ V = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is currently **9** years old.<|im_end|>","Liam's age two years ago was 16 - 2 = <<16-2=14>>14 years old.
Vince's age two years ago was 14/2 = <<14/2=7>>7 years old because Liam's age is twice his.
So Vince age now is 7 + 2 = <<7+2=9>>9 years old.

                    question:
                    Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted 56 easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Camden ? and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( A \) represent the number of eggs that Arnold painted.
Let \( M \) represent the number of eggs that Madeline painted.
Let \( C \) represent the number of eggs that Camden painted.
Let \( S \) represent the number of eggs that Sarah painted.

We know from the problem statement:
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \( A = M \).
- The total number of eggs painted is 56, so \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).
- Camden and Sarah together painted a total of 30 eggs, so \( C + S = 30 \).
- Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so \( C = S + 12 \).

### Step 2: Substitute Known Values
Since \( A = M \), we can substitute \( M \) for \( A \):
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

### Step 3: Express Total Eggs Painted in Terms of One Variable
From the second piece of information, we have:
\[ C + S = 30 \]

### Step 4: Substitute \( C \) in Terms of \( S \)
Using \( C = S + 12 \) in the equation \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
Simplify:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

### Step 5: Calculate \( A \)
Since \( A = M \) and \( A + M + C + S = 56 \), and we already found \( A + M + C + S = 56 \), we see that \( A = M \). So:
\[ A + M = 56 - (C + S) \]
Given \( C + S = 30 \), then \( A + M = 56 - 30 = 26 \).

So, \( A = M = 26 \).

### Step 6: Determine Who Painted More Eggs
Now we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 26 \]
This results in:
\[ C - A = -5 \]

However, since \( C > A \), there seems to be an error in our assumption or calculation. Let’s re-evaluate:

Since \( C = S + 12 \) and \( C + S = 30 \), solving these correctly gives us \( S = 9 \) and \( C = 21 \), so:
\[ A = M = 26 \]
Then:
\[ C - A = 21 - 26 = -5 \] which is incorrect because Camden should have painted more.

Rechecking, if \( S = 9 \), then \( C = 21 \), so:
\[ C - A = 21 - 26 = -5 \] again indicating Camden should have painted more.

Final check shows:
If Camden paints 21 eggs and Sarah paints 9, Camden indeed paints more than Arnold.

Therefore, Camden painted \( 21 - 26 = -5 \) more than Arnold. 

Correcting my previous steps, Camden actually painted more, not less as initially thought. Let me correct the final answer:

**The final answer is:** Camden painted 7 more eggs than Arnold.<|im_end|>","Arnold and Madeline painted 56 - 30 = <<56-30=26>>26 easter eggs.
Arnold and Madeline each painted 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13 easter eggs.
Sarah painted (30 - 12)/2 = 18/2 = <<(30-12)/2=9>>9 easter eggs.
Camden painted 9 + 12 = <<9+12=21>>21 easter eggs.
Camden painted 21 - 13 = <<21-13=8>>8 eggs more than Arnold.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many groups of 8 crayons Nik can make.
2. Calculate the total number of crayons and boxes needed.
3. Find out the total weight of the crayons and boxes.

Let's go through these steps one by one:

### Step 1: Determine the number of groups of 8 crayons
Nik has 200 crayons. To find out how many groups of 8 crayons he can make, we divide 200 by 8:
\[ \frac{200}{8} = 25 \]
So, Nik can make 25 groups of 8 crayons.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of crayons and boxes
Since Nik makes 25 groups of 8 crayons, he will have 25 boxes as well. Therefore, he will use 25 boxes.

### Step 3: Find out the total weight of the crayons and boxes
Each box weighs 8 ounces, so 25 boxes will weigh:
\[ 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 0.1 ounces, for 200 crayons, the total weight is:
\[ 200 \times 0.1 = 20 \text{ ounces} \]

Finally, we add the weight of the boxes and the weight of the crayons together:
\[ 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} + 20 \text{ ounces (crayons)} = 220 \text{ ounces} \]

### Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds
Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert 220 ounces to pounds by dividing by 16:
\[ \frac{220}{16} = 13.75 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and boxes is \(13.75\) pounds.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13.75}
\]<|im_end|>","First find how many boxes Nik needs. 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = <<200/8=25>>25 boxes.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much John makes from selling the planks, let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of wood John gets after cutting the tree.

John starts with an 80-foot tree.
- The percentage of the tree that can be used to make logs is 80%.

\[ \text{Amount of usable wood} = 80\% \times 80 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \text{Amount of usable wood} = 0.80 \times 80 \text{ feet} \]

\[ \text{Amount of usable wood} = 64 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of logs John can get from the usable wood.

Each log is cut from the tree at 4 feet per log.

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{\text{Total usable wood}}{\text{Length of one log}} \]

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} \]

\[ \text{Number of logs} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of planks John can get from each log.

From each log, John cuts 5 planks.

\[ \text{Number of planks per log} = 5 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of planks John has.

\[ \text{Total number of planks} = \text{Number of logs} \times \text{Planks per log} \]

\[ \text{Total number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} \]

\[ \text{Total number of planks} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total revenue John makes from selling the planks.

Each plank sells for $1.2.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total number of planks} \times \text{Price per plank} \]

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 80 \text{ planks} \times \$1.2 \text{/plank} \]

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$96 \]

### Conclusion:
Therefore, John makes a total of $96 from selling the planks.

The final answer is:
{The final answer is: \$96}<|im_end|>","He can use 80*.8=<<80*.8=64>>64 feet of the tree.
That means he can make 64/4=<<64/4=16>>16 logs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how much Valerie's brother earns**

Valerie earns $5000 per month. According to the information given, Valerie earns half of what her brother earns.

Let \( B \) represent her brother's earnings.
\[
B = \frac{1}{2} \times 5000
\]
\[
B = 2500
\]

So, Valerie's brother earns $2500 per month.

**Step 2: Calculate their combined monthly earnings**

Now that we know both values, we can find out how much Valerie and her brother earn together in one month.

Combined monthly earnings:
\[
5000 + 2500 = 7500
\]

So, their combined monthly earnings are $7500.

**Step 3: Determine the mother's earnings**

According to the problem, the mother earns twice as much as their combined monthly earnings.

Mother's earnings:
\[
2 \times 7500 = 15000
\]

So, their mother earns $15000 per month.

**Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money they all have together**

Finally, we add up their individual monthly earnings to get the total amount of money they all have together in one month.

Total amount:
\[
5000 (Valerie) + 2500 (Brother) + 15000 (Mother)
\]
\[
= 7500 + 15000 = 22500

                    Grandma . walks 3 miles every day on ? her favorite walking trail, which includes ! 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on : the sidewalk.  On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed , that she does on the beach.  If 40 minutes of her walk ! is spent on the beach, how long does it take for ! her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total distance**: Grandma walks a total of 3 miles.
2. **Distance on beach**: She walks 2 miles on the beach.
3. **Time spent on beach**: It takes 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach.
4. **Speed ratio**: Grandma walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.

Let's define variables:
- \( d_b \) = Distance walked on the beach (2 miles)
- \( d_s \) = Distance walked on the sidewalk (1 mile)
- \( t_b \) = Time taken to walk 2 miles on the beach (40 minutes)
- \( v_b \) = Speed on the beach
- \( v_s \) = Speed on the sidewalk (since she walks twice as fast on the sidewalk)

From the time spent on the beach:
\[ t_b = \frac{d_b}{v_b} \]
\[ 40 = \frac{2}{v_b} \]

Solving for \( v_b \):
\[ v_b = \frac{2}{40} \]
\[ v_b = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we know the speed on the sidewalk is double the beach:
\[ v_s = 2 \times v_b \]
\[ v_s = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \]
\[ v_s = \frac{2}{20} \]
\[ v_s = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, calculate the time to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk (\( t_s \)):
\[ t_s = \frac{d_s}{v_s} \]
\[ t_s = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} \]
\[ t_s = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, add up all the times:
- Beach: 40 minutes
- Sidewalk: 10 minutes

Total time to complete the 3-mile walk:
\[ T_{total} = 40 + 10 \]
\[ T_{total} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the final answer is:
The final answer is: 50 minutes.<|im_end|>","On the beach, Grandma walks at a rate of 2 miles per 40 minutes, or 2/40 = 1/20 miles per minute.
On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed as when she is on the sand, or 2 * 1/20 = 1/10 miles per minute.
To walk 1 mile on the sidewalk, it takes her 1/(1/10) = <<1/(1/10)=10>>10 minutes.
Thus, in total, it takes Grandma 40+10 = <<40+10=50>>50 minutes to walk her favorite route.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate Jane's current savings:**
   - Jane saves $4 per week.
   - She has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[
\text{Current savings} = \text{Weekly savings} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]

\[
\text{Current savings} = \$4 \times 8 = \$32
\]

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach $60:**

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = \$60 - \text{Current savings}
\]

\[
\text{Remaining amount} = \$60 - \$32 = \$28
\]

3. **Calculate the number of additional weeks required to save $28 at the rate of $4 per week:**

\[
\text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount}}{\text{Weekly savings}}
\]

\[
\text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{\$28}{\$4} = 7
\]

Therefore, it will take Jane an additional 7 weeks to save a total of $60.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is 7.<|im_end|>","She has already saved 8 * $4 = $<<8*4=32>>32.
She needs to save an additional $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the current number of marbles Bob has.
- Let \( x \) represent the total number of marbles Bob currently has.

### Step 2: Set up an equation based on the information given.
- According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles in total.
- Since one dozen equals 12, receiving 2 dozen means he gets \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) additional marbles.
- Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ x + 24 = 60 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 60 - 24 \]
\[ x = 36 \]

So, Bob currently has **36** marbles.

### Step 4: Determine the new number of marbles after losing 10 marbles.
- Bob's total number of marbles increases when he gains 24 marbles, so now he has 36 marbles.
- After gaining 24 marbles, he loses 10 marbles.
- Subtracting 10 from his current total gives us:
\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, Bob will have **26** marbles.

### Final Answer:
{The final answer is} 26<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of marbles Bob starts with.
2 dozen marbles is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 marbles.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break down the conditions and steps required:

1. **Condition for drinking water:**
   - Donny can only drink water if its temperature is at least 40 degrees.

2. **Given temperatures:**
   - Mug A (33 degrees)
   - Mug B (unknown temperature)

3. **Steps to determine the unknown temperature:**
   - Pour 4 ounces from Mug A into the water bottle.
   - Pour 1 ounce from Mug B into the water bottle.
   
Since Donny can only drink the water if its temperature is at least 40 degrees after pouring out some water, we need to ensure that both temperatures meet this condition.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Pouring from Mug A:**
   - Pouring 4 ounces from Mug A will result in a mixture where the total volume of water remains 4 ounces but the temperature depends on the amount taken from Mug A.

   Let \( T_A \) be the temperature of Mug A initially.

   Since the temperature must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water:
   \[
   T_A + x = 40 \quad \text{where} \quad x \leq 4 \quad (\text{since only } x \text{ ounces were poured})
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   T_A \geq 40 - x
   \]

2. **Pouring from Mug B:**
   - Pouring 1 ounce from Mug B results in the same principle as above, where the temperature must also be at least 40 degrees:
   \[
   T_B + y = 40 \quad \text{where} \quad y \leq 1 \quad (\text{since only } y \text{ ounces were poured})
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   T_B \geq 40 - y
   \]

Since both temperatures must be at least 40 degrees, we compare them directly:

\[
T_A \geq 40 - x \quad \text{and} \quad T_B \geq 40 - y
\]

From the given information:
- \(x\) ounces from Mug A means \(x \leq 4\).
- \(y\) ounces from Mug B means \(y \leq 1\).

Now, since Donny can only drink when the temperature is at least 40 degrees:
\[
T_A \geq 40 - x \quad \text{and} \quad T_B \geq 40 - y
\]

Substitute \(x = 4\) and \(y = 1\):
\[
T_A \geq 40 - 4 = 36 \quad \text{and} \quad T_B \geq 40 - 1 = 39
\]

Therefore, the minimum temperature for Mug B must be greater than or equal to 39 degrees.

### Conclusion:
At least **39 degrees** is the minimum temperature that Mug B needs to have for Donny to drink the water.<|im_end|>","There are 5 total ounces of water because 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks, considering the daily contributions from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial number of animals**

- Initial number of cows = 50
- Initial number of chickens = 20

So, initially, there are \(50 + 20 = 70\) animals on the farm.

**Step 2: Calculate the weekly contribution**

- Contribution of cows per week = 20 cows/day * 7 days/week = 140 cows
- Contribution of chickens per week = 10 chickens/day * 7 days/week = 70 chickens

So, in one week, the farm receives:

- 140 cows (from Milkie Cows) + 70 chickens (from Broilers) = 210 new animals

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals at the end of three weeks**

Since the farm operates continuously over three weeks, let's add the total contributions to the initial count:

- Total number of cows after three weeks = 50 (initial) + 140 (daily) * 7 days/week = 50 + 980 = 1030 cows
- Total number of chickens after three weeks = 20 (initial) + 70 (daily) * 7 days/week = 20 + 490 = 510 chickens

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

\[ \text{Total number of animals} = 1030 \text{ cows} + 510 \text{ chickens} = 1540 \]

**Final Answer:** The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **1540**.<|im_end|>","Animals were brought to the farm for three weeks, which is 3*7 = <<3*7=21>>21 days.

To determine the total cost per bagel after Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bagels in 4 packs.
Each pack contains 9 bagels.
\[ \text{Total number of bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \]

### Step 2: Determine the original price before any discounts.
The cost for one pack of bagels is $10.00.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost without any discount.
\[ \text{Total cost without discount} = 4 \times \$10.00 = \$40.00 \]

### Step 4: Apply the 10% discount.
A 10% discount means that Russell pays only 90% of the original price.
\[ \text{Discounted total cost} = \$40.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = \$40.00 \times 0.90 = \$36.00 \]

### Step 5: Divide the discounted total cost by the total number of bagels to find the cost per bagel.

Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.

- Calculate 23 - 5 = **18 scoops**.

So far, we know that Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

### Step 2: Determine how many potatoes were needed for those scoops.
It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops.

- Calculate 6 - 3 = **3 potatoes** per scoop.

Now, if 1 scoop requires 3 potatoes, then 18 scoops will require \( 18 \times 3 = **54 potatoes**\).

### Step 3: Confirm the total number of potatoes used.
We have confirmed that 18 scoops of mashed potatoes use 54 potatoes.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{The final answer is} **54 potatoes**.<|im_end|>","5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes is 23-5=<<23-5=18>>18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

To solve this problem, we'll break it down into two parts: calculating the number of eggs needed in the first 30 days and then in the next 30 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Chester needs in the first 30 days**

- Chester eats 3 eggs per day.
- He does this for 30 days.

\[
\text{Total eggs for the first 30 days} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
= 3 \times 30
\]

\[
= 90 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Chester needs in the next 30 days**

- Chester now eats 5 eggs per day.
- He continues eating for another 30 days.

\[
\text{Total eggs for the next 30 days} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
= 5 \times 30
\]

\[
= 150 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs needed over 60 days**

Add the eggs from both periods:

\[
\text{Total eggs needed} = 90 + 150
\]

\[
= 240 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs needed to dozens**

There are 12 eggs in one dozen.

\[
\text{Total dozens needed} = \frac{\text{Total eggs needed}}{12}
\]

\[
= \frac{240}{12}
\]

\[
= 20 \text{ dozens}

To solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 17 green jelly beans.
   - There are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones.
   - The total number of jelly beans is 60.

2. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green ones,
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jelly beans}
   \]
   Substituting the number of green jelly beans (17),
   \[
   \text{Number of red jelly beans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

3. **Determine the number of blue jelly beans:**
   We know the total number of jelly beans is 60, so we subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = \text{Total number of jelly beans} - (\text{Number of green jelly beans} + \text{Number of red jelly beans})
   \]
   Substituting the known values,
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jelly beans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many years in a decade:**
   - A decade consists of 10 years.

2. **Calculate the number of lemons collected per tree per year:**
   - Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree every year.

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected for all trees over one year:**
   - Since there are 5 trees, the total number of lemons collected in one year is \(5 \times 6\).

4. **Multiply the annual total by the number of years in a decade:**
   - To find out how many lemons Tim gets in a decade, multiply the total number of lemons collected per year by 10.

Now let's perform these calculations:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. Number of years in a decade = 10.
2. Lemons collected per tree per year = 6.
3. Total lemons collected per tree per year = \(5 \times 6 = 30\) lemons.
4. Total lemons collected by all trees per year = \(10 \times 30 = 300\) lemons.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

1. **Determine the total parts in the ratio**:
   The given ratio of men to women is 5:9. This means there are \(5 + 9 = 14\) parts in total (since both numbers add up).

2. **Calculate the number of people per part**:
   We know that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Since these represent 14 parts, we can find out how many people each part represents by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts.
   
   \[
   \text{People per part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

3. **Find the number of men on the bus initially**:
   Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the number of men on the bus would be \(5\) parts times the number of people per part.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of men} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the initial number of women on the bus**:
   Similarly, since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the number of women on the bus would also be \(5\) parts times the number of people per part.
   
   \[
   \text{Number of women} = 9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

5. **Adjust for the change in the number of women after some alight**:
   After 20 women alight from the bus, the remaining number of women will be the initial number minus the 20 who alighted.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34

                    question:
                    Faraday owns a flower shop. He sells a sunflower that costs $2 each and a bouquet of sunflower that costs $8. If Faraday earned ! $26 ? from the sunflower and $56 from the bouquet per day, and if each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, how many sunflowers was Faraday able to : sell after 3 days?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold in total over three days and then calculate how many individual sunflowers he could sell given his earnings.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Daily Sunflower Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $26 per day from selling sunflowers.
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = Total earnings / Cost per sunflower
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers sold per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Calculate Total Sunflower Sales Over Three Days:**
   - Since Faraday sells 13 sunflowers per day,
   - Total number of sunflowers sold over three days = Number of sunflowers per day × Number of days
     \[
     \text{Total number of sunflowers sold over three days} = 13 \times 3 = 39
     \]

3. **Verify Bunches Sold Per Day:**
   - Faraday also sells bunches containing 12 sunflowers for $8 per bunch.
   - Earnings per day from bunches = Total earnings / Number of bunches
     \[
     \text{Earnings per day from bunches} = \frac{56}{12}
     \]
   - Calculate the number of bunches sold per day:
     \[
     \text{Number of bunches sold per day} = \frac{56}{12} \approx 4.67
     \]
   - Since you can't sell a fraction of a bunch, round down to the nearest whole number (since partial bunches don’t make sense):
     \[
     \text{Number of bunches sold per day} = 4
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Bunches Sold Over Three Days:**
   - Since each bunch contains 12 sunflowers,
   - Total number of bunches sold over three days = Number of bunches per day × Number of days
     \[
     \text{Total number of bunches sold over three days} = 4 \times 3 = 12
     \]

5. **Determine the Remaining Sunflowers After Selling All Bunches:**
   - Subtract the number of bunches sold from the total number of sunflowers sold.
   - Number of remaining sunflowers = Total number of sunflowers sold – Total number of bunches sold
     \[
     \text{Number of remaining sunflowers} = 39 - 12 = 27
     \]

### Conclusion:
Faraday sold 27 individual sunflowers after 3 days. 

**The final answer is:** 
\boxed{27}<|im_end|>","Faraday sold $56 / $8 = <<56/8=7>>7 bouquets of sunflower.
So he was able to sell a total of 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84 sunflowers from the bouquets.

The sum of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell is 84 + 13 = <<84+13=97>>97.
Therefore, the total of sunflowers he sold after 3 days is 97 x 3 = <<97*3=291>>291.

                    question:
                    Adam has $100 and wants to spend it to open a rock stand. He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each. If he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his . inventory, how much money does he lose?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks:**
   - Adam buys rocks for $5 each.
   - The cost per rock is $5.

2. **Determine the price at which Adam sells the rocks:**
   - Adam sells the rocks for $7 each.

3. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam will sell if he uses all his money:**
   - Since Adam has $100 initially and sells the rocks at $7 each, let's find out how many rocks he can afford.
   
4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**
   - Let \( n \) be the number of rocks sold. Then \( n \times 7 = \text{total revenue} \).

5. **Calculate the profit or loss based on the sale of the rocks:**
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Initial Investment
   - Loss = Initial Investment - Profit
   
Let's go through these calculations step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the rocks

Since Adam buys the rocks for $5 each and sells them for $7 each, the profit per rock is:
\[ \text{Profit per rock} = \$7 - \$5 = \$2 \]

Adam starts with $100. Therefore, the maximum number of rocks he can sell is:
\[ \text{Number of rocks sold} = \frac{\$100}{\$5} = 20 \]

### Step 2: Determine the price at which Adam sells the rocks

Adam sells the rocks for $7 each.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rocks Adam will sell if he uses all his money

Adam has $100 initially and sells the rocks at $7 each. Let \( n \) be the number of rocks sold. We know that:
\[ n \times 7 = \$100 \]
Solving for \( n \):
\[ n = \frac{\$100}{\$7} \approx 14.29 \]

So, Adam will sell approximately 14.29 rocks.

### Step 4: Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks

If Adam sells 14.29 rocks, his total revenue would be:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 14.29 \times 7 \approx \$99.03 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit or loss based on the sale of the rocks

The initial investment is $100. The profit (or loss) from selling the rocks is:
\[ \text{Profit/Loss} = \$99.03 - \$100 = -\$0.97 \]

Therefore, Adam loses approximately **$0.97**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-0.97}

                    question:
                    Lauren is a cartoonist.  She can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, or she can draw 6 medium-sized picture ! scenes per day, . or she can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.

<|im_start|>user

To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we need to calculate the total number of pictures she needs to draw and then divide that by the number of pictures she can produce in one day for each size.

1. **Calculate the total number of pictures:**
   - Large-sized picture scenes: \(45\)
   - Medium-sized picture scenes: \(36\)
   - Small-sized picture scenes: \(49\)

   \[
   \text{Total number of pictures} = 45 + 36 + 49
   \]

2. **Perform the addition:**

   \[
   45 + 36 = 81
   \]
   
   \[
   81 + 49 = 130
   \]

   So, the total number of pictures Lauren needs to draw is \(130\).

3. **Determine the time required to draw these pictures:**

   - Lauren can draw \(5\) large-sized pictures per day.
   - Lauren can draw \(6\) medium-sized pictures per day.
   - Lauren can draw \(7\) small-sized pictures per day.

   We need to find out which combination gives us the minimum number of days because the maximum number of days will be the limiting factor.

4. **Calculate the number of days needed for each option:**

   **Option A (drawing large-sized pictures):**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total number of pictures}}{\text{Pictures per day}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{130}{5}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = 26
   \]

   **Option B (drawing medium-sized pictures):**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{130}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} \approx 21.67
   \]

   **Option C (drawing small-sized pictures):**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{130}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} \approx 18.57
   \]

5. **Compare the results:**

   - Option A requires approximately \(26\) days.
   - Option B requires approximately \(21.67\) days.
   - Option C requires approximately \(18.57\) days.

Since the maximum number of days between any two options is \(26\) days, Lauren will finish drawing the large-sized pictures in \(26\) days.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many roses Patricia had after giving some away**

- Initially, Patricia has 30 roses.
- She gives 24 roses to her mother.

Let's calculate the remaining roses after giving some away:

\[ \text{Remaining roses} = \text{Initial number of roses} - \text{Number of roses given away} \]

\[

- Patricia buys 15 more roses.

Now, let's add these new roses to what she already has:

\[ \text{Total roses now} = \text{Remaining roses} + \text{Newly purchased roses} \]

\[
\text{Total roses now} = 6 + 15 = 21

<|im_start|>system
To find the average speed for Sid's total travel, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the average speed during the first part of his journey**

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken

\[ \text{Average Speed}_{\text{first part}} = \frac{110 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Average Speed}_{\text{first part}} = 55 \text{ mph} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the average speed during the second part of his journey**

Sid traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken

\[ \text{Average Speed}_{\text{second part}} = \frac{140 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Average Speed}_{\text{second part}} = \frac{140}{3} \text{ mph} \approx 46.67 \text{ mph} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the overall average speed**

To find the overall average speed, we add up all distances and divide by the total time taken.

Total Distance = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Total Time = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Overall Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time

\[ \text{Overall Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} \]

\[ \text{Overall Average Speed} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the overall average speed that Sid was traveling is **50 mph**.<|im_end|>","After traveling 110 miles at first, Sid traveled 110 + 140 = <<110+140=250>>250 miles in total

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets result in winners.

1. **Determine the individual probabilities:**
   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% (or 0.2) chance of winning.
   - The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win compared to the first one. Therefore, it has a \(3 \times 0.2 = 0.6\) (or 60%) chance of winning.

2. **Calculate the combined probability:**
   - Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we multiply their probabilities together to find the overall probability that both tickets are winners.
   
   \[
   P(\text{both winners}) = P(\text{first ticket wins}) \times P(\text{second ticket wins})

                    question:
                    Carlos, Jim and Carrey were at the beach ? playing and they decided to gather ? some seashells. Jim . collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos : collected.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine how many seashells Carlos collected:**
   - We know that Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos.
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
   - Therefore, \( C + 5 = 27 \).
   - Solving for \( C \), we subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     C = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]
   So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

2. **Calculate how many seashells Carrey collected:**
   - Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.
   - Therefore, \( 2R = C \).
   - Since \( C = 22 \):
     \[
     2R = 22
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     R = \frac{22}{2} = 11
     \]
   So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

3. **Verify the total number of seashells collected:**
   - Jim collected 27 seashells.
   - Carlos collected 22 seashells.
   - Carrey collected 11 seashells.
   - Total: \( 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 \) seashells.

4. **Divide the total number of seashells equally among Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:**
   - There are three people sharing the seashells.
   - To find out how many each person gets, we divide the total number of seashells by 3:
     \[
     \text{Number of seashells per person} = \frac{60}{3} = 20
     \]

Therefore, each person (Carlos, Jim, and Carrey) received 20 seashells. The final answer is {The final answer is}: Each person got 20 seashells.<|im_end|>","Jim collected 27 seashells, 5 more than what Carlos collected, which means Carlos collected 27-5 = <<27-5=22>>22 seashells

In total, they collected 27+22+11 = <<27+22+11=60>>60 seashells
They divided them into three equal group, getting 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 each

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten during weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Each weekday, Mason eats 4 carrots.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten during weekdays = \( 5 \times 4 \).

2. **Perform the multiplication for weekdays:**
   - \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \).
   - So, Mason eats 20 carrots during the weekdays.

3. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on weekends:**
   - There are 2 days in the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Each day, Mason eats 5 carrots.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten on weekends = \( 2 \times 5 \).

4. **Perform the multiplication for weekends:**
   - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - So, Mason eats 10 carrots on the weekends.

5. **Add the total number of carrots eaten during weekdays and weekends:**
   - Total carrots eaten during weekdays = 20.
   - Total carrots eaten on weekends = 10.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten in one week = \( 20 + 10 \).

6. **Perform the addition:**
   - \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).
   - So, Mason eats 30 carrots in one week.

Therefore, the final answer is: {The final answer is} 30 carrots.<|im_end|>","He would eat 4 x 5 =<<4*5=20>>20 on weekdays.

   - The first song is given as 5 minutes.
   - The second song is 60% longer than the first song.

2. **Find out how long the second song is**:
   - Calculate 60% of 5 minutes: \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) minutes.
   - Add this to the original length (5 minutes): \( 5 + 3 = 8 \) minutes.

3. **Sum up the lengths of both songs**:
   - Length of the first song: 5 minutes.
   - Length of the second song: 8 minutes.
   - Total length: \( 5 + 8 = 13 \) minutes.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price for one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost for buying two devices on Monday.
3. Determine the total revenue from selling four devices on Tuesday.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the selling price for one mobile device
- The initial price of the mobile device is $20.
- Linus sells it for twice its original price, so the selling price is \( 2 \times 20 = \$40 \).

### Step 2: Determine the total cost for buying two devices on Monday
- Each device costs $20, so for two devices, the total cost is \( 2 \times 20 = \$40 \).

### Step 3: Determine the total revenue from selling four devices on Tuesday
- Each device sold for $40, so for four devices, the total revenue is \( 4 \times 40 = \$160 \).

### Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit
- Total revenue from selling four devices = $160
- Total cost for buying two devices = $40
- Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost = $160 - $40 = $120

Therefore, Linus was able to earn a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.<|im_end|>","The total cost for the devices he bought on Monday is 2*20= <<2*20=40>>40

To determine the length of Carl's cane, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Isabel's height**: We know Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. **Calculate Ned's height**: Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, Ned’s height can be calculated as follows: 
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Calculate Carl's height**: Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl’s height can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \text{ foot}
   \]
4. **Calculate the length of Carl's cane**: The cane is half as long as Carl's height.

Let's go through these calculations step-by-step:

1. **Isabel's height**:
   \[
   \text{Isabel's height} = 7 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Ned's height**:
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}

3. **Carl's height**:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Length of Carl's cane**:
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people's daily energy demands that one bottle of juice can meet.**
   - Since each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand.
   - Therefore, one bottle of juice can cover the energy needs of \( \frac{1}{5} \) (or 20%) of any given person.

2. **Determine how many bottles of juice are needed to meet the energy demands of all 2300 people.**
   - If each bottle meets 20% of an individual's energy demand, then for 2300 individuals, we need:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles per person} = \frac{2300 \times 100\%}{20\%} = \frac{2300}{0.2}

3. **Calculate the total number of bottles produced in one day.**
   - According to the problem, Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Find out how many additional bottles are required to meet the energy demands of all 2300 people.**
   - We already calculated that 11500 bottles are needed to meet the energy demands of all 2300 people.
   - Therefore, the number of additional bottles needed is:
     \[
     \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 - 4200
     \]
     Simplifying this gives us:
     \[
     \text{Additional bottles needed} = 7300

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of babies in each color.
Carla has eight octuplets (since she has identical twins).

- Number of babies in purple: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies in blue: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of babies who wear bows.
We know that half of the blue-wearers also wear bows.

- Number of blue-wearers who wear bows: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \)

Since only the blue-wearers can wear bows, the total number of babies who wear bows is 1.

### Step 3: Determine how many babies wear purple.
All purple-wearers also wear bows.

- Number of purple-wearers who wear bows: \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) (since \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple wearers wear bows)

### Step 4: Calculate the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
Total number of babies who wear bows: 1
Number of purple-wearers who wear bows: 4

Therefore, the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
\[ \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers who wear bows}}{\text{Total number of babies who wear bows}} = \frac{4}{1} = 40\% \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
{The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","First find the number of babies wearing purple: 3/4 * 8 babies = <<3/4*8=6>>6 babies

To determine how many tax reports were received on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Reports from Monday to Friday
First, let's find out the total number of reports received from Monday to Friday.

- Reports on Monday and Tuesday (combined): \(1907\)
- Reports on Thursday and Friday (combined): \(2136\)

Total reports from Monday to Friday = \(1907 + 2136\)

\[ \text{Total reports from Monday to Friday} = 4043 \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Known Report Numbers from Monday to Friday
Now, subtract the known report numbers from Monday to Friday from the total reported in last week.

- Reports on Monday and Tuesday combined: \(1907\)
- Reports on Thursday and Friday combined: \(2136\)

Subtracting these from the total from Monday to Friday gives us the number of reports for Wednesday.

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total from Monday to Friday} - (\text{Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Thursday and Friday}) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 4043 - (1907 + 2136) \]

### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
Let's perform the subtraction:

\[ 4043 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, calculate \(1907 + 2136\):

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

So,

\[ 4043 - 4043 = 0 \]

Thus,

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 0 \]

### Conclusion
Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is **0**.<|im_end|>","Mon/Tues = 1907

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area sold in the first transaction:**
   - Abraham sells half of his land.
   - Half of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) square meters.

2. **Determine the price per square meter from the first sale:**
   - Abraham sells for $50 with 40 square meters.
   - Price per square meter from the first sale = \( \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total area sold in the second transaction:**
   - Abraham sells another quarter (1/4) of his land.
   - One-fourth of 80 square meters is \( \frac{80}{4} = 20 \) square meters.

4. **Determine the price per square meter from the second sale:**
   - Abraham sells for $30 with 20 square meters.
   - Price per square meter from the second sale = \( \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total amount earned from both sales:**
   - Total earnings from the first sale = Area × Price per square meter = \( 40 \times 1.25 = 50 \) dollars.
   - Total earnings from the second sale = Area × Price per square meter = \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) dollars.
   - Total earnings = \( 50 + 30 = 80 \) dollars.

6. **Determine the remaining land:**
   - Abraham initially had 80 square meters and has already sold \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) square meters.
   - Remaining land = Initial land - Sold land = \( 80 - 60 = 20 \) square meters.

7. **Calculate the total earnings from the remaining land at $3 per square meter:**
   - Total earnings from the remaining land = Area × Price per square meter = \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) dollars.

8. **Sum up the earnings from all transactions:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from first sale + Earnings from second sale + Earnings from remaining land.
   - Total earnings = \( 80 + 30 + 60 = 170 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is \(\boxed{170}\).<|im_end|>","Abraham sold 1/2 x 80= <<1/2*80=40>>40 square meters of his unused land.

                    question:
                    Geb is 10 ! less . than half the age of Haley. If Haley is 26 years old, how old is Geb?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Understand the relationship between Geb's age and Haley's age.
- We know that Geb is ""10! less"" than half the age of Haley.

Step 2: Determine what ""10! less"" means in mathematical terms.
- This phrase translates to subtracting 10 from something else.
- Since Geb is less than half the age of Haley, let's denote half the age of Haley as \( \frac{Haley\ Age}{2} \).

Step 3: Express the relationship mathematically.
- Let \( H \) represent the age of Haley.
- The expression for Geb's age can be written as \( G = \frac{H}{2} - 10 \).

Step 4: Substitute the given value of Haley's age into the equation.
- Given that Haley is 26 years old (\( H = 26 \)), substitute this value into the equation.

\[ G = \frac{26}{2} - 10 \]

Step 5: Perform the division and subtraction.
- First, calculate half of 26:
\[ \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]
- Then, subtract 10 from 13:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Step 6: Conclusion.
- Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final Answer: The final answer is {The final answer is}.<|im_end|>","Half of Haley's age is 26/2 = <<26/2=13>>13.
So Geb is 13 - 10 = <<13-10=3>>3 years old.

To determine how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Frequency of wearing the face mask**: Tyrion changes his face mask twice per visit when going out.
2. **Number of visits per day**: Tyrion goes out three times a day.

First, we calculate the number of face masks used in one visit:
\[ \text{Face masks per visit} = 2 \]

Next, we find out how many face masks are used over the course of a day (3 visits):
\[ \text{Face masks per day} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
\[ \text{Face masks in 2 days} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days. 

**Final Answer:**

2. **Calculate how many eggs each person found:**
   - **Lamar:** He finds 5 eggs.
   - **Stacy:** She finds twice as many as Lamar.

<|im_start|>user

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of apartments across all three apartment complexes.
2. Determine how many apartments John collects garbage from (since he only works at one complex).
3. Calculate the total amount of money John makes per collection.
4. Multiply the total amount of money made per collection by the number of collections per week.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apartments
- Each of the first two complexes has 200 apartments.
- The third complex is 60% larger than the sum of the first two complexes.

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \]

Next, determine the size of the third complex:
\[ 400 \times 1.60 = 640 \]

Now, add the apartments from all three complexes:
\[ 400 + 640 = 1040 \]

So, there are 1040 apartments in total.

### Step 2: Determine how many apartments John collects garbage from
Since John only works at one complex, he will collect garbage from the third complex, which has 640 apartments.

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money John makes per collection
John gets $0.40 per collection for each apartment he collects.

Thus, his earnings per collection are:
\[ 640 \times 0.40 = 256 \]

### Step 4: Multiply the total amount of money made per collection by the number of collections per week
John collects garbage 3 times a week.

Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 256 \times 3 = 768 \]

### Final Answer
{The final answer is} 768.<|im_end|>","The first two complexes have 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 apartments
The third one has 400*.6=<<400*.6=240>>240 more apartments than those 2 combined
So in total, it has 400+240=<<400+240=640>>640 apartments
So he goes to 640+400=<<640+400=1040>>1040 apartments each time
That means he visits 1040*3=<<1040*3=3120>>3120 apartments every week

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many fruits a 10-year-old avocado tree produces based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of fruits produced in the first 9 years:**
   - A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
   - A 6-year-old avocado tree produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
   - A 7-year-old avocado tree produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
   - A 8-year-old avocado tree produces \(50 - 200 = -150\) (which means it's not possible for a tree to produce negative fruits).

2. **Calculate the total number of fruits produced in the first 9 years:**
   \[
   50 + 150 + 350 = 550
   \]

3. **Determine the number of fruits produced in the tenth year:**
   - The tenth year, the avocado tree does not produce any fruit.

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits produced over 10 years:**
   \[
   550 + 20 \text{ (since the 10-year old tree produces 20 times the initial amount)} = 550 + 20 = 570
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[

At 10 years, it produces 50 * 20 = <<50*20=1000>>1000 fruits
At 8 years, it produces 200 fewer fruits than at 10 years, so it produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits
During 10 years, an avocado tree can produce a total of 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = <<50+150+350+800+1000=2350>>2350 fruits

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much Sophia gives to Jack:**
   - We know that Sophia gives Jack \(\frac{1}{5}\) of her money.
   - Let's denote Sophia's initial amount as \( S \).
   - Therefore, the amount given to Jack is \(\frac{1}{5}S\).

2. **Calculate the total amount Jack has after receiving from Sophia:**
   - Initially, Jack has $100.
   - After receiving \(\frac{1}{5}S\) from Sophia, Jack's new total becomes:
     \[
     100 + \frac{1}{5}S
     \]

3. **Express the equation in terms of the unknown \( S \):**
   - Since we don't know the exact value of \( S \), we can express the total amount Jack has in terms of \( S \):
     \[
     100 + \frac{1}{5}S
     \]

4. **Find the value of \( S \) if we assume Jack ends up with $160 (as per the problem statement)**:
   - Suppose Jack ends up with $160 after receiving the money from Sophia.
   - We need to find \( S \) such that:
     \[
     100 + \frac{1}{5}S = 160
     \]
   - Subtract 100 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5}S = 60
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 5 to isolate \( S \):
     \[
     S = 300
     \]

5. **Verify the solution**:
   - If Sophia initially had $300, then she gives Jack \(\frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60\) dollars.
   - Adding this to Jack's original $100, Jack would indeed end up with $160.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes given their relationships and the total length.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( R \) be the length of the red rope.
   Let \( B \) be the length of the blue rope.
   Let \( Y \) be the length of the yellow rope.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on Given Information:**

   - The red rope is four times longer than the blue rope:
     \[
     R = 4B
     \]

   - The blue rope is seven centimeters shorter than the yellow rope:
     \[
     B = Y - 7
     \]

   - The sum of the three ropes equals 37 centimeters:
     \[
     R + B + Y = 37
     \]

3. **Substitute \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:**
   Since \( R = 4B \), substitute \( 4B \) for \( R \):
   \[
   4B + B + Y = 37
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5B + Y = 37
   \]

4. **Substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the simplified equation:**
   From the second equation \( B = Y - 7 \), substitute \( B \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
   \[
   5(Y - 7) + Y = 37
   \]
   Distribute and simplify:
   \[
   5Y - 35 + Y = 37
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   6Y - 35 = 37
   \]
   Add 35 to both sides:
   \[
   6Y = 72
   \]
   Divide by 6:
   \[
   Y = 12
   \]

5. **Find the values of \( B \) and \( R \):**
   Substitute \( Y = 12 \) back into the equations:
   \[
   B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5
   \]
   Now find \( R \):
   \[
   R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine how much money Rissa received initially:**
   - Rissa received ""! thrice as much"" as Ronnie.
   - If Ronnie received $5, then Rissa received \(3 \times \$5 = \$15\).

2. **Calculate the total initial amount of money:**
   - Ronnie has $5.
   - Rissa has $15.
   - Total initial amount = $5 + $15 = $20.

3. **Determine the equal amount of money given away:**
   - Let the equal amount given away be \(x\).
   - After giving away \(x\) dollars, Rissa has \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\) dollars left.

4. **Set up the equation for Rissa's remaining money:**
   - The amount Rissa gave away plus the remaining amount should equal the total initial amount.
   - Therefore, \(x + 12 = 15\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - \(x + 12 = 15\)
   - Subtract 12 from both sides: \(x = 15 - 12\)
   - Simplify: \(x = 3\)

6. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Rissa gives away $3.
   - She now has \(15 - 3 = 12\) dollars left.
   - Check if she is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money: 
     - \(\frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\), which matches her remaining amount.

7. **Determine how much money Ronnie has left:**
   - Since no information about what happened to Ronnie’s money is provided, we cannot determine his exact remaining amount based on the given data.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that Ronnie's money is unknown because there is not enough information about what happened to Ronnie's money after the transfer.<|im_end|>","Rissa was given $5 x 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.

To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. **Total amount of paint**: The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Equal parts of red, white, and purple**:
   - We know that there are three different colors (red, white, and purple) and they have an equal number of pints.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of each color (red, white, and purple).

3. **Half the mural is yellow**:
   - Since half of the mural is yellow, we can say that the yellow part corresponds to \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) pints.

4. **Remaining paint**:
   - After accounting for the yellow part, the remaining paint must consist of the other three colors combined. This means the total paint minus the yellow part equals the sum of the red, white, and purple paints.

Let's set up the equation based on the above steps:

\[ x + x + x = 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, each color (red, white, and purple) uses 4 pints of paint.

Since the question asks specifically about the red paint, and knowing that all three colors use equal amounts:

\[ \text{Red paint} = 4 \text{ pints} \]

So, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and then add them up along with the remaining area. Let's break this down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Bedroom
- Each bedroom measures 20 feet by 12 feet.
- Area of one bedroom = length × width = 20 ft × 12 ft = 240 sq ft.

Since there are 4 bedrooms in the house:
- Total area for all four bedrooms = 4 × 240 sq ft = 960 sq ft.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Living Room
- The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom.
- Therefore, the area of the living room = 5 × (area of one bedroom) = 5 × 240 sq ft = 1200 sq ft.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Area of All Rooms Together
- Total area of all rooms combined = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room
- Total area = 960 sq ft (bedrooms) + 1200 sq ft (living room) = 2160 sq ft.

### Step 4: Add the Remaining Area
- We know that the rest of the house is 1000 sq ft.
- Adding the area of the remaining part of the house to the total area of all rooms gives us:
- Total area of the house = 2160 sq ft + 1000 sq ft = 3160 sq ft.

### Final Answer:
The total area of the house is \boxed{3160} square feet.<|im_end|>","The bedrooms are each 20*12=<<20*12=240>>240 square feet
So in total the bedrooms are 240*4=<<240*4=960>>960 square feet

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts over the course of five days.

1. **Monday:**
   - Alice counts 3 puff of clouds.
   
2. **Tuesday:**
   - She doubles the number from Monday.
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ puff of clouds}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   - She doubles the number from Tuesday.
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ puff of clouds}
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   - She doubles the number from Wednesday.
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ puff of clouds}
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   - She doubles the number from Thursday.
   \[
   24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ puff of clouds}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the total number of clouds she counts throughout the week:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Adding these together step-by-step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice has counted in the sky at lunch across all five days is \(93\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

On Thursday she sees twice that amount, 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 puffs of clouds.
On Friday she sees twice the amount of the day before, 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 puffs of clouds.
In total, across all five days, she sees 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = <<3+6+12+24+48=93>>93 total cloud puffs.

                    question:
                    A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the ; same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many dishwasher cycles you can run with the new box at $1, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the regular box.
- The regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods.

### Step 2: Determine the number of pods in the special size box.
- The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
- To find out how many pods this represents, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
  \[
  0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods}
  \]
- Add this to the original 100 pods to get the total number of pods in the special size box:
  \[
  100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the cost per pod.
- Since both boxes have the same price, the cost per pod remains the same as the regular box.
- Given that one box (regular) costs $12 for 100 pods, the cost per pod is:
  \[
  \frac{\$12}{100} = \$0.12 \text{ per pod}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate how many cycles you can run with $1.
- With $1 available, divide it by the cost per pod ($0.12):
  \[
  \frac{\$1}{\$0.12} = 8.33
  \]
- Since you cannot run partial cycles, round down to the nearest whole number:
  \[
  \text{Number of cycles} = 8 \text{ full cycles}
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]<|im_end|>","If the regular box has 100 pods and the special one has 20% more, then the new box has 100 * 20% = 20 more pods
If the new one has 20 more pods than the regular one, the new box has a total of 20+100 = <<20+100=120>>120 pods
If the cost of the regular box ($12) is the same as the new box, then the new box also costs $12
If the new box has 120 pods and the price for the box is $12, then each pod costs $12/120 = $<<12/120=0.10>>0.10
If 1 pod costs $0.10 and is used in 1 cycle, then each cycle costs = $<<1*0.10=0.10>>0.10
If 1 cycle costs $0.10, then for $1 I could run $1/$0.1 = 10 cycles

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine how many $20 bills Thomas initially had.
Thomas withdrew $1000 in $20 bills. We can find out how many $20 bills were used by dividing the total amount withdrawn by the denomination of the bills.

\[
\text{Number of } \$20 \text{ bills} = \frac{\$1000}{\$20}
\]

\[
\text{Number of } \$20 \text{ bills} = 50
\]

### Step 2: Account for the lost bills.
Thomas lost 10 bills. Since each $20 bill represents 20 dollars, losing 10 bills means he lost:

\[
10 \times \$20 = \$200
\]

This reduces the number of bills available:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills left}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining value after paying for a bill.
Thomas pays off one bill using half of the remaining bills. Half of 40 bills is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

Since each bill is worth $20, paying off one bill results in spending:

\[
20 \times \$20 = \$400
\]

After paying off one bill, we subtract this amount from the remaining value:

\[
\$1000 - \$400 = \$600
\]

### Step 4: Convert remaining money back to $20 bills.
Now, Thomas has $600 left. To convert this to $20 bills, divide the remaining amount by the denomination of the bills:

\[
\text{Number of } \$20 \text{ bills} = \frac{\$600}{\$20}
\]

\[
\text{Number of } \$20 \text{ bills} = 30
\]

Thus, Thomas ends up with 30 $20 bills.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]<|im_end|>","He withdrew 1000/20=<<1000/20=50>>50 bills
So he has 50-10=<<50-10=40>>40 bills left over

He triples his money which gives him 20*3=<<20*3=60>>60 bills
So he has 60*20=$<<60*20=1200>>1200
Converting to 5s means he has 1200/5=<<1200/5=240>>240 bills

<|im_start|>super
To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half.
- According to the problem, Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.
- Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A.
- Therefore, Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half.
- The problem states that Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half.
- Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5\) goals in the second half.

### Step 3: Determine the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half.
- The problem also states that Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half.
- This confirms our calculation from Step 2, as \(\frac{1}{4} \times 2 = 0.5\).

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams during the match.
- First half: Team A scored 4 goals, Team B scored 2 goals.
- Second half: Team A scored 0.5 goals.
- Total goals scored by Team A: \(4 + 0.5 = 4.5\)
- Total goals scored by Team B: \(2 + 0.5 = 2.5\)

### Final Answer:
The total number of goals scored in the match is \(4.5 + 2.5 = 7\).<|im_end|>","In the first half, team B scores 4 goals - 2 goals = <<4-2=2>>2 goals.
The total number of goals scored in the first half is 2 goals + 4 goals = <<2+4=6>>6 goals
During the second half, team B scores 4 goals * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 goals.
Team A 1/4 * 8 goals = <<1/4*8=2>>2 goals in the second half.
The total number of goals in the second half is 8 goals + 2 goals = <<8+2=10>>10 goals
The total number of goals in the match is 6 goals + 10 goals = <<6+10=16>>16 goals

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the initial amount of chalk:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Calculate the amount of chalk left after the first day:**
   - The teacher writes 45% of the chalk.
   - Amount written = \( 5 \times 0.45 = 2.25 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \( 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \) inches.

3. **Check if the remaining chalk needs recycling:**
   - Recycle criteria: less than 2 inches.
   - Since 2.75 inches > 2 inches, no recycling needed yet.

4. **Calculate the amount of chalk left after the second day:**
   - The teacher writes 45% of the remaining chalk.
   - Amount written = \( 2.75 \times 0.45 = 1.2825 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \( 2.75 - 1.2825 = 1.4675 \) inches.

5. **Check if the remaining chalk needs recycling again:**
   - Recycle criteria: less than 2 inches.
   - Since 1.4675 inches < 2 inches, the chalk can be recycled.

6. **Calculate the amount of chalk left after the third day:**
   - The teacher writes 45% of the recycled chalk.
   - Amount written = \( 1.4675 \times 0.45 = 0.667875 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \( 1.4675 - 0.667875 = 0.799625 \) inches.

7. **Check if the remaining chalk needs recycling again:**
   - Recycle criteria: less than 2 inches.
   - Since 0.799625 inches < 2 inches, the chalk can be recycled again.

8. **Calculate the amount of chalk left after the fourth day:**
   - The teacher writes 45% of the recycled chalk.
   - Amount written = \( 0.799625 \times 0.45 = 0.36978125 \) inches.
   - Remaining chalk = \( 0.799625 - 0.36978125 = 0.42984375 \) inches.

Since the teacher will continue to write and recycle until the chalk is less than 2 inches, we need to determine when this happens.

9. **Continue the process until the chalk is less than 2 inches:**

- Day 1: 5 inches
- Day 2: 2.75 inches (recycled)
- Day 3: 1.4675 inches (recycled)
- Day 4: 0.799625 inches (recycled)

Continuing in this manner, we see that the chalk will keep reducing but never drop below 2 inches without further recycling. However, since the problem specifies a limit of three days due to the constraint of not being able to write with an extremely small piece of chalk, we stop here.

Given these calculations, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on or around the fifth day, depending on the exact reduction.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is that the teacher will have to recycle the chalk on or around the fifth day.<|im_end|>","The teacher uses 45% of his 5 inch stick of chalk on Monday, or 5 * .45 = <<5*.45=2.25>>2.25 inches.
He is left with 5 - 2.25 = <<5-2.25=2.75>>2.75 inches of chalk.
The next day he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 2.75 * .2 = <<2.75*.2=.55>>.55 inches of chalk used.
That leaves him with 2.75 - .55 = <<2.75-.55=2.2>>2.2 inches of chalk.
The day after that, he will use 2.2 * .2 = <<2.2*.2=.44>>.44 inches of chalk.
That will leave him with 2.2 - .44 = <<2.2-.44=1.76>>1.76 inches of chalk.

To determine how many students in Miss Albert's class are not on varsity, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
- There are 12 girls in total.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \]

\[
= 4 \text{ girls}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
- There are 12 boys in total.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

\[ \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \]

\[
= 3 \text{ boys}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of students on varsity.
- Add the number of girls on varsity and the number of boys on varsity.

\[ \text{Total students on varsity} = 4 + 3 \]

\[
= 7 \text{ students}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of students in the class.
- The class has 12 boys and 12 girls.

\[ \text{Total students} = 12 \text{ (boys)} + 12 \text{ (girls)} \]

\[
= 24 \text{ students}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of students who are not on varsity.
- Subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

\[ \text{Students not on varsity} = 24 - 7 \]

\[
= 17 \text{ students}

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many teeth the dentist fixes.
2. Calculate what percentage of James' total teeth (30) were fixed.

Step 1: The dentist first drills 4 teeth and then caps more than those drilled. Specifically, he cements 7 more teeth than he drilled initially. So, let's calculate that number:
- The dentist drills 4 teeth.
- He cements 7 more teeth than he drilled, which means he cements \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth in total.

Now, we know the dentist has fixed 15 teeth in total (4 from drilling plus 11 from cementing).

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of James' teeth that were fixed. To find this, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:

To calculate the refund amount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the milk:**
   - The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 4000 \times 3.5 = \$14000
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of milk that was sold:**
   - Since all 4000 gallons were sold, this is the total amount.

3. **Calculate the number of gallons that expired:**
   - Mr. Marcellus realized that 2/5 of the milk had passed the expiry date.
   \[
   \text{Gallons Expired} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The company will give a refund for the expired milk.
   \[
   \text{Refund Amount} = 1600 \times 3.5 = \$5600
   \]

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $\boxed{5600}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","If he purchased 4000 gallons, the number of gallons expired is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = <<2/5*4000=1600>>1600 gallons.

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve those equations.

Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

1. **Current Ages:**
   - Wendy is currently five times as old as Colin.
     \[
     W = 5C
     \]

2. **Seven Years From Now:**
   - Seven years from now, Wendy’s age will be \( W + 7 \).
   - Seven years from now, Colin’s age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - According to the problem, at that time, Wendy will be seven years older than Colin.
     \[
     W + 7 = (C + 7) + 7
     \]
     Simplifying this equation gives us:
     \[
     W + 7 = C + 14
     \]
     Substitute \( W = 5C \) into the equation:
     \[
     5C + 7 = C + 14
     \]
     Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     5C + 7 = C + 14
     \]
     Subtract \( C \) from both sides:
     \[
     4C + 7 = 14
     \]
     Subtract 7 from both sides:
     \[
     4C = 7
     \]
     Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     C = \frac{7}{4} = 1.75
     \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   Colin is currently 1.75 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:

To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books Bob can buy.
Bob has $27000 to spend on books.

He buys 100 books for $500. Therefore, his spending rate is $500 per 100 books.

First, calculate how many sets of 100 books he can buy from $27000:
\[
\frac{27000}{500} = 54 \text{ sets}
\]

Each set consists of 100 books, so the total number of books he can buy is:
\[
54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many books Bob can buy per school.
There are three schools, and Bob wants to distribute the books equally among them.

So, divide the total number of books (5400) by the number of schools (3):
\[
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school}
\]

### Conclusion:
Bob can buy **1800** books per school.

Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **First set of apples:**
   - Two apples fall from the tree.
   - One lands on Newton's head (Newton picks it up).
   - One remains on the ground.

2. **Second set of apples:**
   - Another five apples fall from the tree.
   - Newton picks up one apple (putting it in his pocket) and throws the other six into the tree.

3. **Third set of apples:**
   - Seven more apples fall from the tree.
   - Newton picks up one apple (putting it in his pocket) and throws the remaining six back into the tree.

4. **Fourth set of apples:**
   - Nine more apples fall from the tree.
   - Newton picks up all remaining apples except for one and puts that in his pocket, then throws the last one back onto the tree.

Now let's sum up the total number of apples brought home by Newton:

- First set: 1 apple (picked up)
- Second set: 6 apples thrown back into the tree
- Third set: 9 apples thrown back into the tree
- Fourth set: 7 apples picked up and put in his pocket

So, the total number of apples brought home by Newton is \( 1 + 6 + 9 + 7 = 23 \).

To determine the total cost of Ali's coal order, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of bags needed.
Ali orders 850 kilograms of coal, and each bag contains 50 kilograms.

So, Ali needs 17 bags of coal.

### Step 2: Determine the cost per bag.
Each bag costs $18.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all bags.
Multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag.

\[
\text{Total cost} = (\text{Number of bags}) \times (\text{Cost per bag}) = 17 \times 18 = 306

<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the number of slices per person's meal.
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total slices needed for the cheese pizzas = \( 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \).

- Each friend also eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.

Total slices needed for the pepperoni pizzas = \( 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices required.
Total slices needed = Slices from cheese pizzas + Slices from pepperoni pizzas.

\[ 
\text{Total slices} = 36 \text{ (cheese)} + 24 \text{ (pepperoni)} = 60 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of whole pie sets needed.
Each whole pie set contains 12 slices for cheese pizza and 8 slices for pepperoni pizza.

We divide the total slices needed by the number of slices per pie set.

For cheese pizzas:
\[ 
\frac{60}{12} = 5 \text{ sets of cheese pizzas}
\]

For pepperoni pizzas:
\[ 
\frac{60}{8} = 7.5 \text{ sets of pepperoni pizzas}
\]

Since you can't purchase half a set, round up to the nearest whole number.

So, you would need **8** sets of pizza pies.

### Final Answer:

To determine how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to calculate the total distance he ran on all days. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total distance for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:**
   - Sam runs 3 miles on these three days.
   - Number of days = 3 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
   - Distance per day = 3 miles
   - Total distance for these three days = \( 3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Calculate the total distance for Tuesday and Thursday:**
   - Sam runs 5 miles on these two days.
   - Number of days = 2 (Tuesday, Thursday)
   - Distance per day = 5 miles
   - Total distance for these two days = \( 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles} \)

3. **Add the distances together to find the total weekly mileage:**
   - Total distance for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday = 9 miles
   - Total distance for Tuesday and Thursday = 10 miles
   - Total distance for the entire week = \( 9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles} \)

                    question:
                    Jay is making snowballs : to prepare for a snowball fight with his sister. He can build 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 melt every 15 minutes. How long will it take before he has 60 snowballs?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the process into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many snowballs Jay makes per hour**

Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour.

**Step 2: Calculate how many snowballs melt every minute**

Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, we need to find out how many melted in one minute.

\[ \frac{2}{15} = \frac{4}{30} \]

So, 2/15 snowballs melt every minute.

**Step 3: Calculate how many snowballs are left after melting every minute**

We start with 20 snowballs and lose 2/15 snowballs every minute.

Let \( t \) be the time in minutes that passes until Jay has 60 snowballs.

After \( t \) minutes, the number of remaining snowballs would be:

\[ 20 - \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t \]

This should equal 60 snowballs since Jay wants to have enough snowballs to play.

**Step 4: Set up the equation**

\[ 20 - \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = 60 \]

**Step 5: Solve for \( t \)**

First, isolate \( t \):

\[ \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = 20 - 60 \]
\[ \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = -40 \]

Next, divide both sides by \(\left(\frac{2}{15}\right)\):

\[ t = \frac{-40}{\left(\frac{2}{15}\right)} \]
\[ t = -40 \times \left(\frac{15}{2}\right) \]
\[ t = -40 \times 7.5 \]
\[ t = -300 \]

Since time cannot be negative, we correct our approach. We should instead consider the rate at which snowballs are lost:

- At any given time, Jay loses \(\frac{2}{15}\) of his current snowballs.
  
If we assume Jay starts with 20 snowballs, then after \(t\) minutes, he'll have lost \(\frac{2}{15}t\) snowballs from his total of 20 snowballs.

So, if Jay needs to reach 60 snowballs, he must balance these losses with his gains over time.

Therefore, we set up the equation again correctly:

\[ 20 - \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = 60 \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = 20 - 60 \]
\[ \left(\frac{2}{15}\right)t = -40 \]

Now, solving for \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{-40}{\left(\frac{2}{15}\right)} \]
\[ t = -40 \times \left(\frac{15}{2}\right) \]
\[ t = -300 \]

Since time cannot be negative, we realize we made a logical error. The correct approach involves considering the net loss over time, not just the initial difference. Let’s re-evaluate:

Given Jay starts with 20 snowballs and loses 2/15 snowballs every minute, he effectively loses approximately 0.133 snowballs per minute (since \(\frac{2}{15}\approx 0.133\)).

Over time, he effectively loses less than half of what he started with. Thus, we should calculate how many minutes it takes him to reach 60 snowballs while losing snowballs.

Let \( x \) be the number of minutes it takes for Jay to reach 60 snowballs.

\[ 20 - \left(0.133x\right) = 60 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ 20 - 60 = 0.133x \]
\[ -40 = 0.133x \]
\[ x = \frac{-40}{0.133} \]
\[ x \approx 300 \]

Thus, it will take approximately 300 minutes or 5 hours for Jay to collect 60 snowballs.

**Final Answer:** It will take approximately **5 hours** for Jay to collect 60 snowballs.<|im_end|>","Every hour, Jay makes 20 snowballs.
At the same time, each hour 2 * 60/15 = <<2*60/15=8>>8 snowballs melt.
This means that each hour, Jay ends up with 20 – 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 more snowballs.
It will take Jay 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5 hours to create enough snowballs.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age based on the information given about John.

1. **Identify the relationship between their ages:**
   - We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - At that time, John was 28 years old.

2. **Calculate Jim's age at that time:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jim's age when Digimon came out.
   - According to the problem, \( J = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \).

3. **Perform the calculation for Jim's age:**
   \[
   J = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14
   \]

So, when Digimon came out, Jim was 14 years old.

4. **Determine the difference in their ages:**
   - Since John was twice as old as Jim when they first met, the difference in their ages remains constant over time.

5. **Calculate the current difference in their ages:**
   - Currently, John is 28 years old.
   - Therefore, the difference in their ages is:
     \[
     28 - 14 = 14 \text{ years}
     \]

6. **Determine Jim's current age:**
   - Since John is currently 28 years old and there has been a 14-year gap between them,
   - Jim must be younger than John.
   - Thus, Jim's current age can be found by subtracting the difference from John's current age:
     \[
     28 - 14 = 14 \text{ years}

Therefore, Jim is currently 14 years old.

- **Sister**: Her share = 1 + 1 = 2 slices (since she ate 1 more than Doxa)
- **Brother**: His share = Sister's share + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 slices (since he ate 1 more than his sister)

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices eaten by adding up their shares.
- Doxa's share: 1 slice
- Sister's share: 2 slices
- Brother's share: 3 slices

Total slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices

### Final Answer:

                    question:
                    A nurses’ station orders bandages in bulk packs of 50. On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of bandages. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages. On the third ? day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and only used half a pack. They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bandages were initially ordered and then used over three days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Day 1:**
   - Nurses used 38 bandages.
   - Ordered 1 bulk pack (which contains 50 bandages).

2. **Day 2:**
   - Nurses used \( x \) bandages.
   - Since the problem does not specify exactly how many bandages were used, we'll denote this as \( x \).
   - The total number of bandages used on Day 2 must be less than or equal to 38 (since that was the maximum amount from Day 1), so \( x \leq 38 \).

3. **Day 3:**
   - Nurses ordered 2 bulk packs (totaling 100 bandages).
   - Nurses used half a pack (i.e., 25 bandages).

4. **Total Bandages Used Over Three Days:**
   - From Day 1 to Day 3, the total number of bandages used should equal the initial order plus any remaining bandages.

Given that there are 78 bandages left after the third day, we can set up an equation to find out how many bandages were initially ordered.

Let's denote the initial order as \( B \). We know that:
\[ B = 50 + x + 25 \]

Since 78 bandages are left after the third day, the total number of bandages used over the three days must equal \( B \):
\[ B = x + 25 + 78 \]
\[ B = x + 103 \]

We also know:
\[ B = 50 + x + 25 \]
\[ B = 75 + x \]

Equating these two expressions for \( B \):
\[ 75 + x = 103 + x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 75 + x = 103 + x \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 75 = 103 \]

This equation doesn't hold true unless \( x \) is zero because if \( x \neq 0 \), the equation would be inconsistent. Therefore, let's assume \( x = 0 \) for simplicity, meaning no bandages were used on the second day.

So, the correct expression for \( B \) is:
\[ B = 50 + 0 + 25 \]
\[ B = 75 \]

Therefore, the initial order of bandages was 75.

Hence, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]<|im_end|>","Let B be the number of bandages the nurses’ station started with.
On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered 50, so they had B - 38 + 50 = B + 12 bandages left.
On the second day, they used 38 - 10 = <<38-10=28>>28 bandages.
Thus, at the end of the second day, they had B + 12 - 28 = B - 16 bandages left.
On the third day, they ordered 100 bandages and used half a pack, so they used 50 / 2 = 25.
Thus, on the third day, they had B - 16 + 100 - 25 = B + 59 bandages left.
At the end of the third day, they had 78 = B + 59 bandages left.
Thus, on the first day, they started with B = 78 - 59 = <<19=19>>19 bandages.

                    question:
                    May is getting her hair . cut and colored. It costs $40 for the color and $30 per inch of haircut. If her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8, how . much did her cut and color : cost?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of both the haircut and the coloring based on the given information.

Step 1: Calculate the length of hair after the cut.
May's hair originally starts at 10 inches and ends at 8 inches. So, the length of hair she gets after cutting is:

Length of hair = Original length - Length after cutting
                = 10 inches - (8 inches)
                = 2 inches

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the haircut.
The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Since the length of hair after the cut is 2 inches, the cost of the haircut will be:

Cost of haircut = Cost per inch × Length of hair
                = $30/inch × 2 inches
                = $60

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the haircut and coloring.
The total cost will be the sum of the cost of the haircut and the cost of the coloring. The cost of the coloring is not specified in the problem statement, but since it is mentioned that it costs $40, we can assume that the remaining part of the cost ($40) is for the coloring.

Total cost = Cost of haircut + Cost of coloring
           = $60 + $40
           = $100

Therefore, the total cost of the haircut and the coloring is $100.

{The final answer is} The final answer is $100.<|im_end|>","She had 2 inches cut because 10-8=<<10-8=2>>2

                    question:
                    Jen works for 7.5 hours a day 6 days a week. Her hourly rate . is $1.5. Jen also receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Suppose Jen did not incur any absences for  April, and there are exactly 4 ? weeks in April, how much will she receive?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Jen will receive from her work in April, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Jen's regular pay for the entire month.
- Jen works 7.5 hours per day for 6 days a week.
- The number of weeks in April is 4.

First, calculate the total number of working hours in April:
\[ \text{Total Working Hours} = 7.5 \times 6 \times 4 \]

Next, multiply this by Jen's hourly rate ($1.5):
\[ \text{Regular Pay} = (7.5 \times 6 \times 4) \times 1.5 \]

Let's do the calculation first:
\[ 7.5 \times 6 = 45 \]
\[ 45 \times 4 = 180 \]
\[ 180 \times 1.5 = 270 \]

So, Jen earns $270 for her regular work in April.

### Step 2: Add the bonus for complete attendance.
Jen receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance. Since she has no absences, she qualifies for this bonus.

Therefore, add the bonus to her regular pay:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 270 + 10 \]

Let's perform the addition:
\[ 270 + 10 = 280 \]

### Final Answer:
Jen will receive a total of **$280** for her work in April.<|im_end|>","In a week, Jen works for 7.5 hours/day x 6 days = <<7.5*6=45>>45 hours/week

180 hours of work is equal to 180 hours x $1.5 = $<<180*1.5=270>>270.
Since she has complete attendance, she will receive a total of $270 + $10 = $<<270+10=280>>280.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much money Jason earned over a two-week period, we need to calculate his earnings from each activity separately and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Laundry Earnings:
Jason earns $3.00 for doing laundry.
He does laundry once in a two-week period.
So, his total earnings from laundry = $3.00 * 1 = $3.00

#### Room Cleaning Earnings:
Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room.
He cleans his room once in a two-week period.
So, his total earnings from room cleaning = $1.50 * 1 = $1.50

#### Trash Removal Earnings:
Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week.
In a two-week period, he takes the trash out twice.
So, his total earnings from trash removal = $0.75 * 2 = $1.50

#### Dishwasher Emptying Earnings:
Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.
In a two-week period, he empties the dishwasher six times.
So, his total earnings from dishwasher emptying = $0.50 * 6 = $3.00

### Summing Up All Earnings:
Total earnings from laundry: $3.00
Total earnings from room cleaning: $1.50
Total earnings from trash removal: $1.50
Total earnings from dishwasher emptying: $3.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (room cleaning) + $1.50 (trash removal) + $3.00 (dishwasher emptying)

\[
= \$9.00
\]

Therefore, Jason earned a total of **$9.00** over a two-week period.<|im_end|>","Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0.50 each so he made 6*.50=$<<6*.50=3.00>>3.00

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how much blood a single shark has.
2. Calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of blood in one shark

We know from the information given that:
- Each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
- A shark has three times as much blood as a whale.

Therefore, if a whale has 40 gallons of blood, then:
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood per whale} \]
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 3 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Blood per shark} = 120 \]

So, each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks

Now that we know each shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks:
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood per shark} \]
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \]
\[ \text{Total blood for ten sharks} = 1200 \]

So, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is **1200**.<|im_end|>","Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, then a shark has 3*40 = <<3*40=120>>120 gallons of blood.

   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.

2. **Calculate the total number of red pens:**
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, for 5 packs, we calculate \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \) red pens.

3. **Calculate the number of black pen packs:**
   - The problem states that Alain's mom bought twice as many black pens as red pens.
   - Since there are 5 packs of red pens, she bought \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) packs of black pens.

- John spends $600 on 10 bottles of Scotch.
- The cost per bottle of Scotch = $600 / 10 = $60.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per bottle of cognac**
- Cognac costs 50% more than Scotch.
- Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac = $60 + (0.5 * $60) = $60 + $30 = $90.

**Step 3: Determine the number of bottles of cognac John buys**
- John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as Scotch.
- Number of bottles of cognac = 2 * 10 = 20.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cognacs**
- Cost per bottle of cognac = $90.
- Total cost of 20 bottles of cognac = 20 * $90 = $1800.

**Step 5: Add the costs together**
- Cost of Scotch = $600.
- Cost of cognacs = $1800.
- Total cost = $600 + $1800 = $2400.

Therefore, John spends a total of $2400 on everything.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of trees planted on the first day.

Mr. Julius planted:
- Twenty White Oak trees
- Twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees (which would be \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees)

So, on the first day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[ 20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of trees planted on the second day.

On the second day, Mr. Julius planted:
- Ten more White Oak trees than the first day (\(20 + 10 = 30\))
- One-fourth more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day (\(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\))

So, on the second day, the total number of trees planted is:
\[ 30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 10 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 40 \text{ trees} \]

### Step 3: Sum up the total number of trees planted over both days.

Now, let's add the totals from both days:
\[ 60 \text{ (first day)} + 40 \text{ (second day)} = 100 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius over the two days is:

To solve this problem, let's break down each step:

1. **Day 1:**
   - Fred makes 24 gallons.
   - No drinks taken yet.

2. **Day 2:**
   - Fred makes another 24 gallons.
   - Total now = 24 + 24 = 48 gallons.

3. **Day 3:**
   - Fred's children rob the cooler, leaving 20 gallons (4 from Day 1 + 16 from Day 2).
   - Children take 4 gallons.
   - Remaining = 20 - 4 = 16 gallons.

4. **Day 4:**
   - Fred's wife spills 7 gallons.
   - Now, Fred has 9 gallons left (16 from previous day - 4 stolen by kids + 7 spilled by wife).

5. **Day 5:**
   - Fred's friend takes 5 gallons.
   - After taking some, Fred has 4 gallons left (9 original gallons - 5 taken by friend).

So far, we have:
- Day 1: 24 gallons
- Day 2: 24 gallons
- Day 3: 16 gallons
- Day 4: 9 gallons
- Day 5: 4 gallons

Now, Fred needs to distribute these 9 gallons among 3 people at the party. 

Let's calculate how many gallons each person gets:
\[ \text{Each person} = \frac{\text{Total gallons}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

Therefore, each person can drink 3 gallons of root beer at the party.

**The final answer is:** The final answer is 3.<|im_end|>","Fred started with 24 gallons, but on day 1, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 24-4=<<24-4=20>>20 gallons of root beer.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Define the variable:**
   Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs.

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   According to the problem, ""Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs"" equals 40.
   
3. **Translate the statement into an algebraic expression:**
   - Four times the number of coffee mugs can be written as \( 4x \).
   - Eight more than that would be \( 4x + 8 \).

4. **Formulate the equation:**
   Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     4x = 40 - 8
     \]
     \[
     4x = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{32}{4}
     \]
     \[
     x = 8

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    There are 66 fish in the fish tank. : One-third of the fish have red stripes, and 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. Altogether, how many fish have red stripes . and blue stripes?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish that have red stripes and the number that have blue stripes based on the given fractions.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
Given that one-third of the total fish have red stripes:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
\]

Let's perform the calculation:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

So, there are **22** fish with red stripes.

### Step 2: Determine the number of fish left after accounting for those with red stripes.
Subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:

\[
\text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes.
According to the problem, five-tenths (or fifty-fifths) of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44
\]

Now let's perform the calculation:

\[
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

So, there are **20** fish with blue stripes.

### Step 4: Add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes together.
\[
\text{Total number of fish with either color striped} = 22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is **42**.

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is 42.<|im_end|>","One-third of the fish in the fish tank have red stripes, a total of 1/3*66 = <<1/3*66=22>>22 fish

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Amy had two eyeshadow palettes with four colors each and three makeup sets ! that came with six eyeshadow colors each. Her sister steals one of the palettes. Amy uses up half of the colors from ? one makeup set. How many eyeshadow colors does she have left?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eyeshadow colors before any theft or use:**
   - Amy has 2 palettes, each with 4 colors.
     \[
     2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
     \]
   - Amy also has 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors.
     \[
     3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
     \]

2. **Total number of colors initially:**
   \[
   8 \text{ (from palettes)} + 18 \text{ (from makeup sets)} = 26 \text{ colors}
   \]

3. **Determine how many colors Amy's sister steals:**
   - The sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors.

4. **Calculate the remaining colors in the stolen palette after her sister takes some:**
   - Since Amy used up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets, let's assume she used up half of those 6 colors.
     \[
     \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors used}
     \]
   - So, there are \(6 - 3 = 3\) colors left in the stolen palette.

5. **Subtract the stolen colors from both palettes:**
   - From the first palette (which originally had 4 colors):
     \[
     4 \text{ original colors} - 3 \text{ stolen colors} = 1 \text{ color remaining}
     \]
   - From the second palette (which originally had 4 colors):
     \[
     4 \text{ original colors} - 0 \text{ stolen colors (since no other palette was stolen)}
     \]

6. **Add the remaining colors from the stolen palette back into the total count:**

7. **Final calculation:**
   - Palettes now have:
     \[
     1 \text{ color from the first palette} + 0 \text{ colors from the second palette} = 1 \text{ color from the first palette}
     \]
   - Makeup sets still contain all their colors:
     \[
     18 \text{ colors from the makeup sets remain}
     \]

8. **Summing everything up gives us the total remaining colors:**
   \[
   1 \text{ (remaining from first palette)} + 18 \text{ (remaining from makeup sets)} = 19 \text{ colors}
   \]

Therefore, Amy has 19 eyeshadow colors left. 

**The final answer is:** 
\[

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the height of Mattison's house:**
   - Mattison's height = 60 inches.
   - The house is 7 times his height.
   
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times \text{Mattison's height}
   \]

2. **Calculate the height of the first floor:**
   - The first floor is three times as high as Mattison.

   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times \text{Mattison's height}
   \]

3. **Calculate the height of the second floor:**
   - The second floor is the same height as the first floor.

   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor} = \text{Height of the first floor}
   \]

4. **Calculate the height of the roof:**
   - The roof is the difference between the height of the house and the height of the second floor.

   \[
   \text{Height of the roof} = \text{Height of the house} - \text{Height of the second floor}
   \]

Let's perform these calculations step-by-step:

1. Height of the house:
   \[
   \text{Height of the house} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Height of the first floor:
   \[
   \text{Height of the first floor} = 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Height of the second floor:
   \[
   \text{Height of the second floor} = 180 \text{ inches (same as the first floor)}
   \]

4. Height of the roof:
   \[
   \text{Height of the roof} = 420 \text{ inches (house)} - 180 \text{ inches (second floor)} = 240 \text{ inches}

<|im_start|>system
To determine how many shells team Gogetters found, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Determine the number of remaining shells after Alphas have been accounted for.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells.
4. Subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells to find out how many shells were found by team Gogetters.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas:**
   - Total shells = 700
   - Percentage found by Alphas = 40%
   - Number of shells found by Alphas = \( 0.4 \times 700 = 280 \)

2. **Determine the number of remaining shells after Alphas have been accounted for:**
   - Remaining shells = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
   - Remaining shells = \( 700 - 280 = 420 \)

3. **Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells:**
   - Percentage found by The finders = 60%
   - Number of shells found by The finders = \( 0.6 \times 420 = 252 \)

4. **Subtract the shells found by teams Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells to find out how many shells were found by team Gogetters:**
   - Number of shells found by Gogetters = Total shells - (Shells found by Alphas + Shells found by The finders)
   - Number of shells found by Gogetters = \( 700 - (280 + 252) = 700 - 532 = 168 \)

Therefore, the number of shells that team Gogetters found is \( 168 \).

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the total number of dogs**: Bernie has 4 dogs.

2. **Calculate the total amount of walking needed for all dogs**:
   - The first dog walks 1 mile.
   - The second dog walks 4 miles.
   - The third dog walks 3 miles.
   
   Let's add these up: \(1 + 4 + 3 = 8\) miles.

3. **Determine the average walking distance per dog**:
   - There are 4 dogs in total.
   - The average walking distance per dog is given as 3 miles.

4. **Verify if the total walking distance matches the average**:
   - If each dog walks an average of 3 miles, then the total walking distance should be \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.
   - However, we calculated that the total walking distance is 8 miles, which doesn't match the average.

5. **Adjust the calculation based on the average**:
   - Since the average is correct (each dog walks 3 miles), we need to adjust our understanding of the problem.
   - We know that the total walking distance must equal the sum of individual distances plus any remaining distance.

6. **Find the remaining distance after accounting for the averages**:
   - Subtract the total walking distance from the sum of individual distances: \(8 - 12\).
   - This results in a negative value, indicating that there might be an error in the initial assumptions or calculations.

7. **Re-evaluate the approach**:
   - Given the constraints, we realize that the average must include the unknown distance for the fourth dog.
   - Let's denote the unknown distance for the fourth dog as \(x\).

8. **Set up the equation**:
   - Each dog walks an average of 3 miles, so the total walking distance is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) miles.
   - The unknown distance for the fourth dog can be represented as \(x\).

9. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - Add the unknown distance \(x\) to the sum of individual distances: \(1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12\).
   - Simplify: \(8 + x = 12\).
   - Solve for \(x\): \(x = 12 - 8 = 4\).

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.

{The final answer is} The last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.<|im_end|>","The total walk distance must be 12 miles because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12

To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps.

1. **Calculate the total loan amount:**
   - The value of John's home is $250,000.
   - He gets a loan worth 40% of that value.
   
\[

3. **Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts:**
   - Subtract the amount paid towards debts from the total loan amount.

If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to , the market?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of the tunas caught and then calculate the earnings from selling them at the given price.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the tunas:**
   - The first tuna weighs 56 kg.
   - The second tuna weighs 46 kg.
   - The third tuna weighs 26 kg.

   Adding these weights together:
   \[
   56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per kilogram of tuna:**
   - A kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the tunas:**
   - Multiply the total weight (in kilograms) by the price per kilogram.
   \[
   128 \times \$0.50 = \$64
   \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is: The final answer is $\$64$.<|im_end|>","Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.
He will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.
And he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.
Therefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Determine the selling price per magazine.
Trinity sells the magazines for \( \frac{1}{8} \) of the price she bought them.

Given that she bought the magazines for $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:
\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Buy Price} \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
Substitute the buy price ($72):
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.
First, simplify \( 1 - \frac{1}{8} \):
\[
1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{8}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}
\]

### Step 3: Multiply to find the selling price.
Now multiply the buy price by \( \frac{7}{8} \):
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 72 \times \frac{7}{8}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
\[
72 \times \frac{7}{8} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

So, the selling price per magazine is $63.

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the buying price.
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Buy Price}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Profit} = 63 - 72 = -9
\]

### Conclusion.
Since the result is negative, it indicates a loss rather than a profit.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is: A loss of $9}.<|im_end|>","Trinity sells magazines at 11/8*$72=$<<11/8*72=99>>99.

<|im_start|>header
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water the dehumidifier removes over different periods at various settings. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Determine the amount of water removed at each setting.
- **Low setting:** Removes 1 liter of water per day.
- **Medium setting:** Removes twice as much water as the low setting.
- **High setting:** Removes twice as much water as the medium setting.

From these facts, we can calculate:
- Medium setting = \(2 \times 1\) liter/day = 2 liters/day
- High setting = \(2 \times 2\) liters/day = 4 liters/day

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water removed over the specified time period.
- **Low setting** for 3 days: 
\[ 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \]

- **Medium setting** for 3 days:
\[ 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \]

- **High setting** for 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \]

### Step 3: Sum up all the amounts to get the total removal.
Total water removed = Low + Medium + High
\[ Total = 3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} \]
\[ Total = 29 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in his basement is {The final answer is} 29 liters.<|im_end|>","The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, for a total of 2*1=<<2*1=2>>2 liters of water per day.

3 days on the low setting removes 3*1=<<3*1=3>>3 liters of water.
3 days on the medium setting removes 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 liters of water.
And 5 days on the high setting removes 5*4=<<5*4=20>>20 liters of water.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons filled.
- Jolene has 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.

\[
\text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack}

So, they have a total of 300 balloons.

Step 2: Determine how many balloons were thrown away or not used.
- At the end of the day, there are 12 balloons left.

\[
\text{Balloons thrown} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Remaining balloons}

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of each medicine Saanvi used for one dose and then calculate the total volume for eight doses.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the amount of the first medicine:**
   - The problem states that for one dosage, Saanvi combined 14 mL of the first medicine.
   
2. **Calculate the amount of the second medicine:**
   - According to the problem, the second medicine was 3 times the amount of the first medicine.
     \[
     \text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times 14 \text{ mL}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount of second medicine} = 42 \text{ mL}
     \]

3. **Verify the total volume for one dose:**
   - Add the amounts of both medicines together to confirm they sum up correctly.
     \[
     \text{Total volume for one dose} = 14 \text{ mL (first medicine)} + 42 \text{ mL (second medicine)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total volume for one dose} = 56 \text{ mL}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total volume for eight doses:**
   - Multiply the total volume of one dose by the number of doses (which is 8).
     \[
     \text{Total volume for eight doses} = 56 \text{ mL/dose} \times 8 \text{ doses}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total volume for eight doses} = 448 \text{ mL}

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the capacity of Ali's class:**
   - Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

2. **Calculate the capacity of John's class:**
   - John has two classes.
   - Each of John's class has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class.
   - Therefore, the capacity of each of John's class = \( \frac{1}{8} \times 120 \).

3. **Compute the total number of students in John's classes:**
   - Since there are two classes in John's school,
   - Total students in John's classes = \( 2 \times \left( \frac{1}{8} \times 120 \right) \).

4. **Simplify the expression for John's class capacity:**
   - Calculate \( \frac{1}{8} \times 120 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen needs to repay.
Stephen initially borrows $300.

Step 1a: Add 2% interest to the initial loan.
Interest = 2% of $300
\[ \text{Interest} = 0.02 \times 300 = \$6 \]

Total amount Stephen needs to repay (principal + interest):
\[ \text{Total repayment needed} = \$300 + \$6 = \$306 \]

### Step 2: Determine the monthly payments over the first 11 months.
Stephen gives $25 per month for 11 months.

Amount given in the first 11 months:
\[ \text{Amount given in 11 months} = 11 \times \$25 = \$275 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the amount already paid from the total repayment needed.
After giving $275, the remaining amount that needs to be repaid includes the principal plus any accrued interest up to this point.

Remaining amount after 11 months:
\[ \text{Remaining amount} = \$306 - \$275 = \$31 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount paid in the twelfth month.
Since the remaining amount ($31) does not cover even one full payment of $25, Stephen must pay the remainder as the full amount in the twelfth month.

Therefore, Stephen will pay:
\[ \boxed{\$31} \] in the twelfth month.<|im_end|>","Stephen will pay an additional $300 x 2/100 = $<<300*2/100=6>>6.

For eleven months Stephen will pay a total of $25 x 11 = $<<25*11=275>>275.
Therefore, Stephen will pay 306 - 275 = $<<306-275=31>>31 on the twelfth month.

                    question:
                    Tim enters a competition and has to try and guess the number of red jelly beans in a jar.  The jar has a square base and is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall.  He knows that a jelly bean is .15 cubic inches.  He also ! knows that they get about 80% efficiency in packing.  He estimates 30% of the jelly beans are red.  The true number of red jelly beans in the container is 900.  How far off was his guess?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how far off Tim's estimate was from the actual number of red jelly beans, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar.
The jar is a rectangular prism (box) with dimensions 6 inches by 6 inches by 15 inches.

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

\[
V_{\text{jar}} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
Given that there are approximately 80% efficiency in packing, we can use the given number of red jelly beans (900) as an approximation for the total number of jelly beans in the jar.

Since only 30% of the jelly beans are red, we calculate the total number of jelly beans as follows:

\[
N_{\text{total}} = \frac{\text{Number of red jelly beans}}{0.3}
\]

\[
N_{\text{total}} = \frac{900}{0.3} = 3000 \text{ jelly beans}
\]

### Step 3: Estimate the number of red jelly beans based on the jar's volume.
We know that each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches. To find out how many jelly beans fit into the jar, we divide the jar’s volume by the volume occupied by one jelly bean:

\[
N_{\text{red}} = \frac{V_{\text{jar}}}{\text{volume per jelly bean}}
\]

\[
N_{\text{red}} = \frac{540}{0.15} = 3600 \text{ red jelly beans}
\]

### Step 4: Compare Tim's estimate with the actual number of red jelly beans.
Tim estimated the number of red jelly beans at 900. However, according to our calculations, the correct number should be 3600.

### Step 5: Calculate the difference between Tim's estimate and the actual number.
\[
\Delta N = |N_{\text{estimated}} - N_{\text{actual}}|
\]
\[
\Delta N = |900 - 3600| = 2700
\]

Therefore, Tim's guess was **2700** units away from the actual number of red jelly beans in the jar.<|im_end|>","The volume of the container is 6*6*15=<<6*6*15=540>>540 cubic inches
That means it can fit 540/.15=<<540/.15=3600>>3600 jelly beans
With 80% packing efficiency, you can fit 3600*.8=<<3600*.8=2880>>2880 jelly beans in there
So that means he guesses 2880*.3=<<2880*.3=864>>864 are red
So his guess is off by 900-864=<<900-864=36>>36

   - Total number of people after the third stop = Doubling the current number = 105 * 2 = 210.

5. **Check if the bus can accommodate all these people:**
   - The bus's capacity is 200.
   - Since 210 exceeds the bus’s capacity (200), some space will remain unfilled.

### Conclusion:
Since the bus cannot accommodate all 210 passengers, there will be a shortage of seats. To find out how many additional people would fit into the bus, subtract its capacity from the total number of people:

\[ 210 - 200 = 10 \]

Therefore, the bus requires an additional **10** people to be fully filled.<|im_end|>","If the number of passengers increased by 3/4 times the number that entered the bus on the first station, 3/4 * 40 people = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus on the second station.

The number of people doubled at the third station, which is 90 people * 2 = <<90*2=180>>180 people.
If the bus has a capacity of 200, the number of people required to fill the bus is 200 people - 180 people = <<200-180=20>>20 people

                    question:
                    Pauline visits her favorite local museum three times a year. The : cost of one visit , is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much Pauline spent in total over the 8 years (5 initial years + 3 additional years), we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of visits per year.
Pauline visits the museum three times a year.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of visits during the first 5 years.
\[
\text{Total visits} = \text{Number of visits per year} \times \text{Number of years}
\]
\[
\text{Total visits} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in cost after 5 years.
The cost increases by 150%. Therefore, the new cost is 2.15 times the original cost ($2).

### Step 4: Calculate the new cost per visit after the increase.
\[
\text{New cost per visit} = \text{Original cost} \times \text{Increase factor}
\]
\[
\text{New cost per visit} = \$2 \times 2.15 = \$4.30
\]

### Step 5: Determine the total cost for all visits during the first 5 years.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of visits} \times \text{New cost per visit}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 15 \times \$4.30 = \$64.50
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for all visits during the next 3 years.
Since Pauline continues to visit the museum for 3 more years at the same rate as the first 5 years,
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of visits} \times \text{New cost per visit}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times \$4.30 = \$12.90
\]

### Step 7: Sum the costs from both periods.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 5 years} + \text{Cost for next 3 years}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$64.50 + \$12.90 = \$77.40
\]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum over the 8 years is **$77.40**.<|im_end|>","Pauline visited the local museum 3 times a year, so she paid 3 * 2 = $<<3*2=6>>6 every year on visits.
That means during the first 5 years Pauline spend 5 * 6 = $<<5*6=30>>30 on tickets.
After 5 years the cost of one visit increased by 150/100 * 2 = $<<150/100*2=3>>3.
That means the new price of the ticket was 2 + 3 = $<<2+3=5>>5.
So for per year Pauline paid 3 * 5 = $<<3*5=15>>15.
During the last 3 years, she paid in total 3 * 15 = $<<3*15=45>>45.
In total Pauline spend 30 + 45 = $<<30+45=75>>75 on visits at the museum.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of groups needed:**
   - There are 10 students in each grade.
   - Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time.
   - Therefore, we need \(\frac{10}{8}\) groups (since each group consists of 8 students).

2. **Calculate the number of groups required:**
   - \(\frac{10}{8} = 1.25\) groups.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we round up to the nearest whole number because even if one group doesn't use its full 45 minutes, all other groups must wait until that group finishes.

3. **Round up to the next whole number:**
   - We round up 1.25 to 2 groups.

4. **Calculate the total time available:**
   - Each group has 45 minutes.
   - Since there are 2 groups, the total time available is \(2 \times 45\) minutes.

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - \(2 \times 45 = 90\) minutes.

Therefore, it will take 90 minutes for everyone to try the escape room if each group uses its full 45 minutes.<|im_end|>","There are 4 grades in the middle school x 10 students = <<4*10=40>>40 students who get to try the escape room.
There will be 40 students / 8 students in a group = <<40/8=5>>5 groups who get to try the escape room.
It will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = <<5*45=225>>225 minutes.

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Ali has to pay John, we need to calculate the total cost of the wooden tables and roof frames that John made for him.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the wooden tables**
- John made 4 wooden tables.
- Each table costs $20.

\[
\text{Total cost of wooden tables} = \text{Number of wooden tables} \times \text{Cost per wooden table}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of wooden tables} = 4 \times 20 = \$80
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the roof frames**
- John made 2 roof frames.
- Each roof frame costs $10.

\[
\text{Total cost of roof frames} = \text{Number of roof frames} \times \text{Cost per roof frame}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of roof frames} = 2 \times 10 = \$20
\]

**Step 3: Add the costs together**

\[
\text{Total amount paid by Ali} = \text{Total cost of wooden tables} + \text{Total cost of roof frames}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount paid by Ali} = 80 + 20 = \$100

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the lengths of the shorter and longer pieces after Ian makes a cut on his 40-foot-long board.

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece.
   
2. **Express the Longer Piece in Terms of \( x \):**
   According to the problem, the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. Therefore, the length of the longer piece will be \( 4x \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   x + 4x = 40
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   5x = 40
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

5. **Find the Length of the Longer Piece:**
   Substitute \( x \) back into the expression for the longer piece:
   \[
   4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[

To determine how much of the secret seasoning Aiden needs, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of meatballs needed:**
   - Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.

2. **Determine the number of meatballs per pound of ground beef:**
   - Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.

3. **Calculate the total pounds of ground beef required:**
   - To find out how many pounds of ground beef are needed to get 80 meatballs, divide the total number of meatballs (80) by the number of meatballs per pound (16):
     \[
     \text{Total pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16}
     \]
     Simplifying this fraction gives us:

     \text{Total pounds of ground beef} = 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the amount of secret seasoning needed:**
   - Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
   - Since he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:
     \[
     \text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2
     \]
     Simplifying this multiplication gives us:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine the total cost of a 36-minute call, we need to consider two different pricing scenarios based on the duration of the call.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for a 16-minute call.**
- The initial price is $0.25 per minute.
- For a 16-minute call, the calculation is straightforward since it falls within the first scenario where the price remains constant at $0.25 per minute.
\[
\text{Cost} = \text{Price per minute} \times \text{Number of minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Cost} = \$0.25 \times 16
\]
\[
\text{Cost} = \$4.00
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for a 36-minute call after the price drop.**
- The new price is $0.20 per minute.
- We will use the same formula as before but this time for an 36-minute call.
\[
\text{Cost} = \text{Price per minute} \times \text{Number of minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Cost} = \$0.20 \times 36
\]
\[
\text{Cost} = \$7.20
\]

**Final Step: Compare the costs.**
- The cost for a 16-minute call is $4.00.
- The cost for a 36-minute call is $7.20.
Since the price drops after 16 minutes, the cost for a 36-minute call should be less than or equal to the cost for a 16-minute call. However, in this case, the cost for a 36-minute call exceeds the cost for a 16-minute call due to the additional minutes beyond the initial 16 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$7.20}
\]<|im_end|>","First 16 minutes would be a cost of 16 * 0.25 = $<<16*0.25=4>>4.
After that, there are 36 - 16 = <<36-16=20>>20 minutes of the call left.
And these 20 minutes cost 20 * 0.2 = $<<20*0.2=4>>4.
So in total, the 36-minute call would cost 4 + 4 = $8.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly made.

2. **Express Brownies in Terms of Cupcakes:**
   According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
   
   - Three times as many cupcakes would be \( 3C \).
   - Therefore, 2 less than that would be \( 3C - 2 \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since each person gets two treats, if there are five people, then the total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) should equal twice the number of people.
   
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]
   
   So,
   \[
   \text{Treats} = C + (3C - 2)

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   C + 3C - 2 = 4C - 2
   \]
   
   Thus, the equation becomes:
   \[
   4C - 2 = 10

   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   C = 3

\[ \text{Discount Amount} = 20\% \times \$75 = 0.20 \times \$75 = \$15 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ \text{Final Total Cost} = \$75 - \$15 = \$60 \]

### Step 3: Add the cost of nail art.
Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, which costs $3 per nail.

Let's assume Karen has \( n \) nails. The total cost for nail art would be:
\[ \text{Nail Art Cost} = \$3 \times n \]

Since the number of nails \( n \) is not specified, we can only express the total cost for nail art as:
\[ \text{Nail Art Cost} = \$3n \]

### Final Answer:
The total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{\$60} \] for the base service plus the cost of the nail art.<|im_end|>","The cost for both manicure and pedicure is $35+$40=$<<35+40=75>>75.
The discount is $75*0.2=$<<75*0.2=15>>15.
So, Karen would only pay $75-$15=$<<75-15=60>>60 for both services.
The cost of the nail art for 10 fingers is $3*$10=$<<3*10=30>>30.
Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $60+$30=$<<60+30=90>>90.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of magazines per year for each type.
- **First Magazine**: Sends 12 issues per year.
- **Second Magazine (base)**: Sends 6 issues per year.
- **Third Magazine**: Sends 4 times the amount of the second magazine, which means \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues per year.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of magazines per year.
We need to add up all the magazines from each source:

\[
\text{Total magazines} = \text{Magazines from first type} + \text{Magazines from second type} + \text{Magazines from third type}
\]

Substituting in our values:

\[
\text{Total magazines} = 3 (\text{from the first type}) + 1 (\text{from the second type}) + 24 (\text{from the third type})
\]

\[
\text{Total magazines} = 3 + 1 + 24
\]

\[
\text{Total magazines} = 28
\]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is \(\boxed{28}\).<|im_end|>","She has 3 magazines that send 12 issues so that’s 3*12 = <<3*12=36>>36 issues

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many paintings Shelley has**

Given that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim.

Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.
Shelley's total = \( K + 8 \)

**Step 2: Calculate how many paintings Samantha has**

Samantha has 27 paintings, which is given directly in the problem.

**Step 3: Establish the relationship between Samantha and Shelley's paintings**

We know that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.

So,
\( S = T - 12 \)
Where \( S \) represents Samantha's paintings (which we already know), and \( T \) represents Shelley's paintings.

Substituting the known values:
\( 27 = T - 12 \)

Now solve for \( T \):
\( T = 27 + 12 \)
\( T = 39 \)

So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

**Step 4: Find out how many paintings Kim has**

Since Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can write:
\( T = K + 8 \)

Substitute the value of \( T \) from Step 3:
\( 39 = K + 8 \)

Now solve for \( K \):
\( K = 39 - 8 \)
\( K = 31 \)

Therefore, Kim has **31 paintings**.<|im_end|>","Shelley has 27+12=<<27+12=39>>39 paintings.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the final price of the toy after all the changes, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new price after the increase from November to December.
2. Calculate the new price after the decrease from December to January.
3. The final answer will be the price after the January discount.

Let's start with Step 1:

1. **Increase from November to December:**
   - Initial price = $40
   - Increase percentage = 80%
   
   To find the new price after the increase:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Initial Price} + (\text{Initial Price} \times \frac{\text{Increase Percentage}}{100})
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 40 + (40 \times \frac{80}{100}) = 40 + (40 \times 0.8) = 40 + 32 = 72
   \]

So, the price after the increase is $72.

Next, let's move on to Step 2:

2. **Decrease from December to January:**
   - New price after increase = $72
   - Decrease percentage = 50%
   
   To find the new price after the decrease:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Price After Increase} - (\text{Price After Increase} \times \frac{\text{Decrease Percentage}}{100})
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 72 - (72 \times \frac{50}{100}) = 72 - (72 \times 0.5) = 72 - 36 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the price of the toy after the January discount is $36.

This completes our calculations, so the final answer is:

\boxed{36}<|im_end|>","In November, the toy's price was $<<40=40>>40.

The 50% increment from January represents 72*0.5=<<72*0.5=36>>36
In January, the toy's price is 72 - 36 = $<<72-36=36>>36.

                    question:
                    Charlie is a tennis pro.  He spends most of the day teaching others lessons on how to improve their game.  His standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons, but he reduces his rate by 25% when he is giving lessons to . a veteran.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate Charlie's reduced rate for veterans.
Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour. When he teaches a veteran, he reduces his rate by 25%.

\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \text{Standard Rate} - (\text{Standard Rate} \times 0.25) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$80 - (80 \times 0.25) \]
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$80 - \$20 \]
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$60 \]

So, Charlie charges $60 per hour when teaching a veteran.

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from regular lessons.
Charlie has 4 one-hour lessons at his standard rate ($80/hour).

\[ \text{Total Earnings from Regular Lessons} = 4 \times \$80 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings from Regular Lessons} = \$320 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from veteran lessons.
Charlie has 2 one-hour lessons with a veteran at his reduced rate ($60/hour).

\[ \text{Total Earnings from Veteran Lessons} = 2 \times \$60 \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings from Veteran Lessons} = \$120 \]

### Step 4: Add up all earnings.
Now, let's add the earnings from both types of lessons together:

\[ \text{Total Amount Made} = \$320 + \$120 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount Made} = \$440 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $\boxed{\$440}$.<|im_end|>","4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate cost 4*$80=$<<4*80=320>>320.

Thus, for veterans, he charges the reduced rate of $80-$20=$<<80-20=60>>60 per hour,
Thus, 2 1-hour lessons with veterans cost 2*$60=$<<2*60=120>>120.
All together, Charlie will make $320+$120=$<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

To find Sally's mean (average) score, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Sum all the scores together.
First, let's add up all the scores given.

Scores: 50, ; 80, : 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Summing them up:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 \]

Let's do this step-by-step:
- Add 50 and 80 first: \(50 + 80 = 130\)
- Next, add 80: \(130 + 80 = 210\)
- Then, add 60: \(210 + 60 = 270\)
- Continue with 40: \(270 + 40 = 310\)
- Next, add 90: \(310 + 90 = 400\)
- Add 100: \(400 + 100 = 500\)
- Finally, add 70: \(500 + 70 = 570\)

So, the total sum of the scores is **570**.

### Step 2: Count the number of scores.
Sally has 9 scores in total.

### Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of scores.
To find the mean, divide the total sum by the number of scores.

Mean score = Total sum / Number of scores
\( \text{Mean} = \frac{570}{9} \)

Now, perform the division:
\[ \frac{570}{9} = 63.33 \]

### Final Answer:
The mean score is **63.33**.<|im_end|>","Sally's total score is 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = <<50+80+80+60+40+90+100+70+60=630>>630.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pomelos Eve gave away. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pomelos Eve has after giving some away.
Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos. According to the problem, after giving away some pomelos, she is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the original amount.

Let \( x \) be the number of pomelos Eve gives away. Therefore, the remaining number of pomelos can be expressed as:
\[ 20 - x = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the value on the right side of the equation.
First, calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \):
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]
So, Eve is left with 5 pomelos.

### Step 3: Set up the equation and solve for \( x \).
We know that:
\[ 20 - x = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20 - x = 5 \]
\[ 20 - 5 = x \]
\[ 15 = x \]

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{15}}

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:**
   - Walter bought 60 apples.
   - He ate \(\frac{2}{5}\) of them.

\[
\text{Number of apples eaten} = 60 \times \frac{2}{5} = 24
\]

2. **Calculate the number of apples left after eating some:**
   - Subtract the number of apples eaten from the total number of apples.

\[
\text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36
\]

3. **Calculate the number of apples given to his sister:**
   - Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.

\[
\text{Apples given to sister} = 36 \times \frac{25}{100} = 9
\]

4. **Calculate the number of apples left after giving some to his sister:**
   - Subtract the number of apples given to his sister from the remaining apples.

\[
\text{Remaining apples after giving to sister} = 36 - 9 = 27

5. **Calculate the price per apple when selling to his uncle:**
   - Walter sells these apples for $3 each.

\[
\text{Price per apple} = \$3

   - We know that 9 novels represent 3/4 of her total novels.
   - Let \( T \) be the total number of novels Regina has written so far.

2. **Set up an equation based on the given information:**
   - Since 9 is 3/4 of \( T \), we can write the equation as:
     \[
     9 = \frac{3}{4}T
     \]

3. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - To isolate \( T \), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
     \[
     9 \times \frac{4}{3} = T

So, Regina has written a total of 12 novels.

4. **Calculate the number of novels she will write this year:**
   - This year, she writes 9 more novels than last year (since we're considering the current situation).
   - Therefore, the number of novels she will write this year is:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18
     \]

5. **Summarize the results:**
   - Regina has already written 12 novels in total.
   - She plans to write 18 more novels this year.

Therefore, the final answer is: The number of novels Regina has written this year is 18.<|im_end|>","Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year

                    question:
                    Michael is traveling on the interstate at an average speed of 50km/hr (taking into account all the necessary stops for ! gas, relaxation, etc.).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine the percentage of the total distance that Michael has traveled, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent driving:**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/h.
   - The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km.
   
   Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   We can calculate the time as follows:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{6000 \text{ km}}{50 \text{ km/h}} = 120 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days Michael drives:**
   - Michael travels for 3 days.

3. **Calculate the actual travel time per day:**
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day,
   \[
   \text{Travel Time Per Day} = \frac{120 \text{ hours}}{3 \text{ days}} = 40 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

4. **Convert the travel time per day back to hours:**
   - To convert hours per day to hours per hour, divide by 24:
   \[
   \text{Hours per Hour} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Find the total travel time over the 3 days:**
   - Multiply the daily travel time by 3:
   \[
   \text{Total Travel Time} = 40 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the fraction of the total distance covered:**
   - Divide the total travel time by the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Fraction Covered} = \frac{120 \text{ hours}}{6000 \text{ km}} = \frac{1}{50} = 0.02
   \]

7. **Convert the fraction to a percentage:**
   - Multiply the fraction by 100:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Coverage} = 0.02 \times 100 = 2\%

<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how many grapes were used to make the first glass of juice**
Madeline ate 6 grapes.
Her brother made 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.

\[ \text{Grapes used} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \]

So far, they have 30 grapes left (after making the juice).

**Step 2: Determine how many grapes were used to make the pies**

Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, where each pie requires 12 grapes.

\[ \text{Total grapes needed for pies} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

However, since she only had 30 grapes initially, we can see that it's not possible to make 4 pies with just 30 grapes. Therefore, we will assume that they do not make any pies using the remaining grapes after making the juice.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of grapes consumed or available at the start**

- Grapes eaten by Madeline: 6
- Grapes used in juice: 30

Total grapes at the beginning would be:

\[ \text{Total grapes} = 6 + 30 = 36 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of ingredients per meal.
2. Determine the number of meals per year.
3. Multiply the total annual cost by the number of meals per year.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients per meal

- Pasta cost: $1.00 per box (assuming a standard box size)
- Cheddar cheese cost: $3.00 per meal
- Gruyère cheese cost: Twice the cheddar cheese cost = $6.00 per meal

Total ingredient cost per meal = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of Gruyère cheese
= $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00
= $10.00

### Step 2: Determine the number of meals per year

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, there are 52 weeks in a year.

Number of meals per year = 52

### Step 3: Calculate the total annual cost

Total annual cost = Total ingredient cost per meal × Number of meals per year
= $10.00 × 52
= $520.00

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{520}.<|im_end|>","The gruyere cheese is twice the cost of the $3.00 cheddar cheese so it costs 2*3 = $<<2*3=6.00>>6.00

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time is spent cleaning classrooms over the course of 5 days working 8 hours a day.

**Step 1: Calculate total number of classrooms**
There are 80 classrooms in the school.

**Step 2: Calculate total cleaning time required**
It takes 15 minutes to clean one classroom.
So for 80 classrooms, the total cleaning time is \( 80 \times 15 = 1200 \) minutes.

**Step 3: Convert the total cleaning time from minutes to hours**
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour,
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} ÷ 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of work hours available**
They work 8 hours a day for 5 days.
So the total number of work hours available is \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) hours.

**Step 5: Determine the fraction of the day spent cleaning**
We divide the total cleaning time (in hours) by the total work hours available:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{40 \text{ hours}} = 0.5 \]
This means that 50% of the day is spent cleaning classrooms.

Therefore, **the final answer is**: The final answer is 50%.<|im_end|>","They have to clean 16 classrooms a day because 80 / 5 = <<80/5=16>>16

                    question:
                    Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer ; books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine the number of books that each shelf can hold**

- **Bottom shelf**: Let's denote the number of books the bottom shelf can hold as \( B \).
  
- **Middle shelf**: Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.

- **Top shelf**: The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Therefore, the top shelf holds \( B - 5 \) books.
  
Given that the total number of books Elly has is 110, we can set up an equation based on these relationships:

\[ B + 10 + 10 + (B - 5) = 110 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ B + 10 + 10 + B - 5 = 110 \]
\[ 2B + 15 = 110 \]

Subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2B = 95 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ B = 47.5 \]

So, each shelf can hold 47.5 books. However, since you cannot have half a book in practice, let's consider rounding to the nearest whole number. 

**Step 2: Adjust for practical constraints**

Since you can't practically hold half a book, let's assume each shelf holds either 48 or 47 books. We'll check which option fits best.

Let's try assuming each shelf holds 48 books instead:

- Bottom shelf: 48 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 48 - 5 = 43 books

Total books:

\[ 48 + 10 + 43 = 101 \] (This is less than 110)

Now, if each shelf holds 47 books:

- Bottom shelf: 47 books
- Middle shelf: 10 books
- Top shelf: 47 - 5 = 42 books

Total books:

\[ 47 + 10 + 42 = 109 \] (This is also less than 110)

Both options fall short of holding exactly 110 books. Given the practical constraint, we should aim for the closest value without going over 110.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of bookcases needed**

We know there are two middle shelves and one bottom shelf. So, let’s calculate the number of bookcases required:

- Two shelves for the middle sections.
- One shelf for the bottom section.

Thus, the total number of bookcases needed would be:

\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 3 bookcases to hold all 110 books.

**Final Answer:**
{The final answer is} 3<|im_end|>","The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.

Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.

<|im_start|>system
To determine Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost**
Rose buys five dozens of eggs at $2.40 per dozen.

- Total cost = Number of dozens × Cost per dozen
- Total cost = 5 × $2.40

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \]

So, the total cost is $12.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue**
Rose sells her eggs in groups of three for $1.

- Revenue from selling eggs = (Number of eggs / Eggs per group) × Selling price per group
- Number of eggs = 5 dozens × 12 eggs/dozen
- Number of eggs = 60 eggs
- Revenue = (60 ÷ 3) × $1

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Revenue} = (60 ÷ 3) × 1 = 20 \times 1 = 20 \]

So, the total revenue is $20.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the profit**
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Let's calculate this:
\[ \text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is **$8.00**.<|im_end|>","Rose bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 x 5 = $<<2.40*5=12>>12.

Thus, the total earnings of Rose for selling the eggs are $1 x 20 = $<<20=20>>20.
Therefore, her profit will be $20 - $12 = $<<20-12=8>>8.

Skyler has 100 hats in total, half of which are red.
\[
\text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the remaining hats after accounting for red hats**

Subtracting the number of red hats from the total gives us the remaining hats.
\[
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50

**Step 3: Determine the number of blue hats**

Three-fifths of the remaining hats are blue.
\[
\text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30

**Step 4: Calculate the number of white hats**

Since the rest of the hats are white, we subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
\[

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sticks in one bag**
Archie buys 1 bag of beef jerky.

- Number of sticks per bag = 30 sticks

So far, we know there are **30 sticks** in one bag.

**Step 2: Determine the original price per stick before any discount**
Given that each bag costs $18.00, we first find the price per stick without considering the discount.

- Price per stick (original) = Total price per bag / Number of sticks per bag
- Price per stick (original) = $18.00 / 30 sticks

Calculating this gives us:

\[ \text{Price per stick (original)} = \frac{\$18.00}{30} = \$0.60 \]

This means each stick originally costs $0.60.

**Step 3: Apply the discount to the price per stick**
It's mentioned that the bags are on sale for $3.00 off a bag.

- Discounted price per stick = Original price per stick - Discount amount per stick
- Discounted price per stick = $0.60 - ($3.00 / 30)

Calculating the discount amount per stick:

\[ \text{Discounted price per stick} = \$0.60 - (\$3.00 / 30) \]
\[ \text{Discounted price per stick} = \$0.60 - \$0.10 \]
\[ \text{Discounted price per stick} = \$0.50 \]

Now, each stick now costs **$0.50** after the discount.

**Step 4: Convert the discounted price per stick into cents**

Since $0.50 is already in dollars, let's convert it to cents.

- Conversion factor from dollars to cents: \(1 dollar = 100 cents\)
- Cents per stick = Disbanded price per stick * 100

Thus,

\[ \text{Cents per stick} = \$0.50 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Cents per stick} = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs **50 cents**.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blueberry cubes Mary made based on the information given about the strawberries.

Step 1: Define variables.
Let \( x \) represent the number of strawberry cubes Mary makes.

Step 2: Set up an equation based on the information provided.
We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes can be represented as \( 5x - 4 \).

Step 3: Write an equation representing the total number of ice cubes.
The total number of ice cubes (strawberry + blueberry) equals 116. So, we have:
\[ x + (5x - 4) = 116 \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ x + 5x - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6x - 4 = 116 \]

Step 5: Solve for \( x \).
Add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6x = 120 \]
Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = 20 \]

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.

Step 6: Calculate the number of blueberry cubes.
Since the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5x - 4 \), substitute \( x = 20 \):
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary made 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is:

Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116
Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120

<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of games played over four years**:
   - Ara has been playing 40 games per year.
   - She has been on the team for four years.

   \[
   \text{Total number of games} = 40 \times 4 = 160
   \]

2. **Calculate the total points scored**:
   - Each game scores her 21 points.
   
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 160 \times 21
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication to find the total points**:
   - First, multiply 160 by 21.

   \[
   160 \times 21 = 3360
   \]

Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is \(3360\).

Ending note: The final answer is \(\boxed{3360}\).<|im_end|>","Forty games every year translates to 40*4 = <<40*4=160>>160 games in four years.

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how many marbles Brendan ended up with, we will follow his journey step-by-step:

### Step 1: Initial number of marbles
Brendan starts with 10 marbles.

### Step 2: Marbles dropped after being hit by a pebble
He drops half of them, so he loses:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ marbles} \]
This leaves him with:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ marbles} \]

### Step 3: Search for the lost marbles
After dropping half, Brendan searches for the remaining marbles. He finds 3 more marbles.

### Step 4: Remove non-marbles from what he found
From these 3 found marbles, one turned out to be a bead instead of a marble. So, he removes the bead:
\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ marbles} \]

### Step 5: Subtract the beads from the current count
Now that he knows one of the found marbles was not a marble, he subtracts this bead from the total number of marbles he has left:
\[ 2 \text{ (found marbles)} \]
So, he now has:
\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ marbles} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, Brendan ends up with **3 marbles** in total.<|im_end|>","Brendan dropped his marbles and was left with 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5 marbles.

                    question:
                    Jason works as a salesperson at a car dealership.  He needs to sell 15 cars this month to earn a big bonus.  He knows based on historical averages, that for every 25 telephone , calls he makes to potential customers, he gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  And for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  Based on these average numbers, how many telephone calls would ; Jason need , to make to sell 15 ! cars and earn his bonus?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into smaller steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of visits needed per car sold.
From the information given:
- For every 2 cars sold, there must be 4 customer visits (since 2 customers visit twice).
- Therefore, to sell 15 cars, Jason would need \( \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \) customer visits. Since he cannot have half a visit, he needs to round up to the next whole number. Thus, he needs **8** customer visits to ensure he sells at least 15 cars.

### Step 2: Determine the number of phone calls required for those visits.
Given that he needs 8 customer visits, and knowing that he gets one customer visit from every 25 phone calls:
\[ \text{Number of phone calls} = \frac{\text{Number of visits}}{25} \]
Substituting in our value for visits:
\[ \text{Number of phone calls} = \frac{8}{25} \]

### Step 3: Simplify and calculate.
\[ \text{Number of phone calls} = 0.32 \]

Since Jason cannot make partial phone calls, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, he needs **1** additional phone call beyond the initial calculation because even if he only made 0.32 phone calls, he wouldn't reach his goal of selling 15 cars without making more.

### Final Calculation:
\[ \text{Total phone calls needed} = \left\lceil \frac{8}{25} \right\rceil + 1 \]
Where $\left\lceil x \right\rceil$ denotes the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest whole number.

Thus,
\[ \text{Total phone calls needed} = 1 + 1 = 2 \]

Therefore, Jason needs to make **2** phone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.<|im_end|>","If it takes 2 customers to make one sale, then to get his 15 sales Jason will need 2*15=<<2*15=30>>30 customers to come into the car dealership.

<|im_start|>user
To determine the total number of candles and flashlights used when the lights go out, let's break down the information given:

1. **Number of People**: There are 4 people (including Brianna) who will need a flashlight.
2. **Number of Flashlights Needed**: Each person needs a flashlight, so \(4\) flashlights are needed.
3. **Number of Rooms**: There are \(8\) rooms in the house.

Now, let's calculate the number of flashlights:

- Total flashlights = Number of people \(\times\) Flashlight per person
- Total flashlights = \(4 \times 1 = 4\)

Next, we'll calculate the number of candles:

1. **Candles for Half the Rooms**:
   - Half of the rooms means \(8 / 2 = 4\) rooms.
   - For these rooms, there are \(4\) small candles each.
   - Therefore, for \(4\) rooms: \(4 \times 4 = 16\) small candles.

2. **Candles for the Other Half the Rooms**:
   - The remaining \(4\) rooms would also use \(4\) medium candles each.
   - Therefore, for \(4\) rooms: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) medium candles.

Finally, summing up the total number of candles:

- Total candles = Small candles + Medium candles
- Total candles = \(16 + 20 = 36\)

In summary, the total number of candles and flashlights used when the lights go out is:

\[ \text{Total flashlights} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Total candles} = 36 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{\text{4 flashlights and 36 candles}}\).<|im_end|>","For every one of the 8 rooms in the house, there are 2 flashlights, 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 flashlights.

Total, there are 16 + 4 = <<16+4=20>>20 flashlights in the house being used by Brianna and her family.
For half of the 8 rooms, there are 4 small candles each, 8/2 x 4 = <<8/2*4=16>>16 small candles in half the rooms.
For the other half of the 8 rooms, there are 5 medium candles each, 8/2 x 5 = <<8/2*5=20>>20 medium candles in all the rooms.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chips Mitchell bought:**
   - Mitchell buys two bags of chips.
   - Each bag contains 55 chips.

   \[
   \text{Total chips} = 2 \times 55
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication to find the total number of chips:**

   \[
   2 \times 55 = 110

To determine the total time it takes for John to solve the Rubik's cube, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **First Side**:
   - Time taken: \(5\) minutes

2. **Second Side**:
   - Since this is twice as long as the first side, we calculate:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Third Side**:
   - Similarly, this is also twice as long as the first side:
     \[

     \]

5. **Fifth Side**:
   - Once you reach the fifth side, there are no more sides left to solve.

Now, let's sum up all these times:
\[
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 = 27.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is \(\boxed{27.5}\) minutes.<|im_end|>","The second and third side each take 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 minutes

<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the old varnish.
- The old varnish typically takes 7 minutes per painting.
- Number of paintings = 6.

\[
\text{Total time (old varnish)} = \text{Number of paintings} \times \text{Time per painting}
\]
\[
= 6 \times 7 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 42 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings with the new varnish.
- The new varnish typically takes 12 minutes per painting.
- Number of paintings = 6.

\[
\text{Total time (new varnish)} = \text{Number of paintings} \times \text{Time per painting}
\]
\[
= 6 \times 12 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in drying time between the two methods.
- Difference in time = Total time (new varnish) - Total time (old varnish)
\[
= 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
= 30 \text{ minutes}

To determine how much water Crista needs daily for her plants, we'll break down the information provided:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Total number of plants: 20

1. **Identify the groups of plants**:
   - 4 plants need half a cup of water.
   - 8 plants need one full cup of water.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water needed**:
   
   - For the 4 plants that need half a cup each day:
     \[

     \]

   - For the 8 plants that need one full cup each day:
     \[
     8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
     \]

3. **Sum up all the amounts of water**:
   \[
   2 + 8 = 10 \text{ cups per day}
   \]

Therefore, Crista needs a total of **10 cups of water** every day for her plants.<|im_end|>","She will need 2 cups for the plants that need half of a cup of water because .5*4 = 2 cups

                    question:
                    The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and ! washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home ! in the swamp.  To return home, he will need ; to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and ; swims through ! water at a speed of 10 , yards per minute, how long will ! it , take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the . distance is on land and the other half is in water?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how long it takes Phineas to return home, we need to break down the journey into two parts: one on land and one in water.

**Step 1: Determine the total distance**
Phineas needs to travel a total distance of 200 yards.

**Step 2: Determine the distances for each part of the journey**
Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we divide the total distance by 2.
\[ \text{Distance on land} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]
\[ \text{Distance in water} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the time to cover the distance on land**
Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. 
\[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{\text{Distance on land}}{\text{Speed on land}} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the time to cover the distance in water**
Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.
\[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{\text{Distance in water}}{\text{Speed in water}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 5: Add the times together**
\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 + 10 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home.<|im_end|>","Half of 200 yards is 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 yards.

100 yards at 10 yards per minute is 100/10=<<100/10=10>>10 minutes.
In total, it will take Phineas 5+10=<<5+10=15>>15 minutes to return home.

To determine how much it will cost Bob to create the Washington Monument using popsicle sticks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of boxes needed:**
   - Bob wants 56 popsicle sticks.
   - Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks.

\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total popsicle sticks}}{\text{Popsicle sticks per box}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ boxes}

2. **Determine the total cost based on the number of boxes:**
   - Each box costs $2.00.
   
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box} = 7 \times 2 = \$14.00

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost for all five phones on the plan.

1. **Identify the cost of the main phone:**
   - The main phone costs $20.
   
2. **Determine the cost of one additional phone:**
   - Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of one additional phone is half the cost of the main phone.
   - Therefore, the cost of one additional phone = \(\frac{20}{2} = 10\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost for all five phones:**
   - For five phones, there will be four additional phones (since the main phone already counts).
   - The total cost for these four additional phones = \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
   - Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the four additional phones gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Main phone + Four additional phones = \(20 + 40 = 60\) dollars.

### Conclusion:
The total cost for the whole phone plan is $\boxed{60}$ dollars.<|im_end|>","Each additional phone costs 20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10.

   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - There are 12 doughnuts in a dozen.

\[
10 \text{ dozens} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of photos Jade has**

Jade took 210 photos at the end of the week.

**Step 2: Determine how many photos she uploads per batch**

She uploads 7 photos in one batch.

**Step 3: Calculate how many photos she uploads each day**

Since she uploads 6 batches each day, we can calculate the number of photos uploaded per day as follows:
\[ \text{Photos per day} = \text{Batches per day} \times \text{Photos per batch} \]
\[ \text{Photos per day} = 6 \times 7 \]

Let's do the multiplication:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

So, she uploads 42 photos per day.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of days needed to upload all photos**

We know she has 210 photos in total and she uploads 42 photos per day. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day:
\[ \text{Days needed} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Photos per day}} \]
\[ \text{Days needed} = \frac{210}{42} \]

Now let's perform the division:
\[ \frac{210}{42} = 5 \]

Therefore, Jade will need **5 days** to upload all her photos.

**Final Answer:** The final answer is: {The final answer is 5}.<|im_end|>","Jade needs a total of 210 photos / 7 photos/batch = <<210/7=30>>30 batches to upload all her photos.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning over 5 weeks, we need to calculate the cost for each type of clothing (blouses, skirts, and pants) and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the blouses
- Number of blouses per week: 5
- Cost per blouse: $5.00
- Total cost for blouses per week = 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00

Since this happens every week:

\[ \text{Total cost for blouses over 5 weeks} = 5 \times \$25.00 = \$125.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the skirts
- Number of skirts per week: 1
- Cost per skirt: $6.00
- Total cost for skirts per week = 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00

Since this happens every week:

\[ \text{Total cost for skirts over 5 weeks} = 5 \times \$6.00 = \$30.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for the pants
- Number of pairs of pants per week: 2
- Cost per pair of pants: $8.00
- Total cost for pants per week = 2 pairs * $8.00/pair = $16.00

Since this happens every week:

\[ \text{Total cost for pants over 5 weeks} = 5 \times \$16.00 = \$80.00 \]

### Step 4: Sum up all costs for 5 weeks
- Total cost for blouses over 5 weeks: $125.00
- Total cost for skirts over 5 weeks: $30.00
- Total cost for pants over 5 weeks: $80.00

Adding these together gives us the total amount spent on dry-cleaning over 5 weeks:

\[ \text{Total cost over 5 weeks} = \$125.00 + \$30.00 + \$80.00 = \$235.00 \]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\$235.00}
\]<|im_end|>","The blouses cost $5.00 each to dry clean and she has 5 so that's 5*5 = $<<5*5=25.00>>25.00

                    John decides to take up an odd hobby of speed talking.  His normally speaking speed is 150 WPM.  After training his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting , speed.  How long would it take him to speak 10 pages if ? each page has 450 words per page?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break down the information given:

1. John's normal writing speed (WPM) is 150.
2. After training, his speed increases by 2.5 times compared to his original speed.
3. Each page contains 450 words.

First, we need to calculate John's new writing speed after training:
- New speed = Original speed * Training factor
- New speed = 150 * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to determine how many words he can write in one minute at his new speed:
- Words per minute = New speed / 60
- Words per minute = 375 / 60 ≈ 6.25 words/minute

Now, we'll find out how many minutes it takes for him to write 10 pages, where each page contains 450 words:
- Total words = Number of pages * Words per page per page
- Total words = 10 * 450 = 4500 words

Finally, we'll calculate the time needed to write these words at his new speed:
- Time (in minutes) = Total words / Words per minute
- Time (in minutes) = 4500 / 6.25 ≈ 720 minutes

So, it would take John approximately **720 minutes** or about **12 hours** to read 10 pages if each page contains 450 words.<|im_end|>","He can speak 150*2.5=<<150*2.5=375>>375 words per minute

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and follow it step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - Number of people: 50

2. **Second Day:**
   - More people than the first day: \(50 + 20 = 70\)

3. **Third Day:**
   - Twice the number from the second day: \(70 \times 2 = 140\)

Now, let's summarize the number of people for each day:

- First day: 50 people
- Second day: 70 people
- Third day: 140 people

Next, we know that on the fourth day, the average number of people was 60. Since we don't have information about the fourth day specifically, we'll assume that the pattern continues as described (i.e., the fourth day would also be 60 people).

For the remaining days of the week, we need to find out how many people were at the beach each day. Let's denote the total number of people seen during the week as \(T\). We already have three specific numbers:

- First day: 50
- Second day: 70
- Fourth day: 60

Let’s call the unknowns for the other two days as follows:
- Fifth day: \(x\) people
- Sixth day: \(y\) people

We can set up an equation based on the total number of people over the seven days:

\[ T = 50 + 70 + 140 + x + y + 60 \]

Since we only have five specific values (first, second, fourth, fifth, and sixth), we cannot determine the exact value of \(T\) without additional information. However, if we assume all days except the fourth one follow the same pattern, then we can express \(T\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\):

\[ T = 50 + 70 + 140 + x + y + 60 \]
\[ T = 320 + x + y \]

Given that the fourth day has 60 people, and assuming the pattern holds, the fifth and sixth days would also have 60 people. Therefore, we can conclude that the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]<|im_end|>","There were 50 people at the beach on the first day. On the second day, the number of people at the beach increased to 50 people + 20 people = <<50+20=70>>70 people

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
Let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. **Initial Popping Rate**: Let's assume the initial popping rate is \( R \) kernels per minute.

2. **First 30 Seconds**:
   - Number of kernels popped: \( 20 \)
   - Time = 30 seconds (which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) minutes)

3. **Next 30 Seconds**:
   - Number of kernels popped: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \)
   - Time = 30 seconds (which is \( \frac{1}{2} \) minutes)

4. **Next 30 Seconds**:
   - Number of kernels popped: \( 4 \times R \)
   - Time = 30 seconds (which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) minutes)

5. **Final 30 Seconds**:
   - Number of kernels popped: \( \frac{R}{2} \)
   - Time = 30 seconds (which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) minutes)

Now let's calculate the total number of kernels popped over time:

- Total time = 90 seconds (30 + 30 + 30 + 30)
- Total number of kernels popped = \( 20 + 60 + 4R + \frac{R}{2} \)

We need to express everything in terms of the initial rate \( R \):

- For the second interval, \( 60 \) kernels are popped.
- For the third interval, \( 4R \) kernels are popped, so \( 4R = 8R \).
- For the fourth interval, \( \frac{R}{2} \) kernels are popped, so \( \frac{R}{2} = \frac{R}{2} \).

So the total number of kernels popped is:

\[ 20 + 60 + 8R + \frac{R}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 80 + 8.5R \]

Since we know the total number of kernels popped is an integer, and since \( 8.5R \) must be an integer (because it represents the number of kernels), \( R \) must be such that \( 8.5R \) is an integer.

Therefore, \( R \) can only be a multiple of 2 because 8.5 is not an integer.

If \( R = 2k \) where \( k \) is an integer, then \( 8.5R = 17k \), which means \( R \) could be 2, 4, 6, etc.

For simplicity, let's take \( R = 2 \):

- If \( R = 2 \):
  - Total kernels popped = \( 80 + 8.5 \times 2 = 80 + 17 = 97 \)

Now, after taking off the heat, a quarter of these kernels pop back on top of the remaining ones. So the number of kernels that pop back will be:

\[ \frac{97}{4} = 24.25 \]

Since you can't have a fraction of a kernel, round this to the nearest whole number, which is 24.

So the final count of kernels that pop before taking off the heat would be:

\[ 97 - 24 = 73 \]

And if those kernels continue to pop while left out, the last group of kernels will pop back on the remaining kernels. This doesn't change the total count since they all end up being counted.

So the total number of kernels that Garrett has to eat is:

\[
\boxed{73}
\]<|im_end|>","In the second 30 seconds of cooking, 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 kernels pop.
In the third 30 seconds, 4 * 20 = <<4*20=80>>80 kernels pop.
In the final 30 seconds, 80 / 2 = <<80/2=40>>40 kernels pop.
After cooking, the residual heat makes 40 / 4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kernels pop.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate how much lemon juice is needed for 4 gallons of lemonade**

- Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup (8 ounces) of lemon juice per gallon.
- Therefore, for 4 gallons, he needs \(4 \times 8 = 32\) cups of lemon juice.

**Step 2: Determine how much lemon juice can be extracted from 6 lemons**

- According to Tim, 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Thus, 6 lemons can extract 1 cup of juice.

**Step 3: Calculate how many times more tart the extra gallon should be compared to the others**

- The extra gallon is supposed to be twice as tart as the rest.
- This means it requires twice the amount of lemon juice as the regular gallon.

**Step 4: Determine the total amount of lemon juice required for both gallons**

- Regular gallon: 32 cups of lemon juice.
- Extra gallon (twice as tart): \(32 \times 2 = 64\) cups of lemon juice.

**Step 5: Calculate the number of lemons needed for all gallons combined**

- Each regular gallon uses 6 lemons.
- So, for 4 regular gallons, he needs \(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons.
- And for the extra gallon, he needs another 6 lemons.

Therefore, in total, he needs \(24 + 6 = 30\) lemons.

So, **the final answer is**: 30 lemons.<|im_end|>","Tim is going to make one gallon twice as tart as the others and each gallon needs 1 cup of juice. So he needs 2*1 = <<2*1=2>>2 cups for the tart batch

All total he will need 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 cups of juice
Each cup requires 6 lemons each and he needs 6 cups of juice so 6 * 6 = <<6*6=36>>36 lemons needed

                    The Kennel house keeps 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. If a German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of : dog food and : a bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog ! food per day. How many kilograms of dog ? food will they need in a week?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate daily consumption for all dogs.
First, let's find out how much dog food is consumed by one German Shepherd per day.

- Each German Shepherd eats **5 kg** of dog food per day.

Next, since there are 3 German Shepherds, we can calculate their total daily consumption:

\[ \text{Total daily consumption for German Shepherds} = 3 \times 5 \text{ kg/day} = 15 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total daily consumption for all dogs (German Shepherds and Bulldogs):

- There are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.
  
Since each German Shepherd eats 5 kg per day, and each Bulldog also eats 3 kg per day, we have:

\[ \text{Daily consumption for Bulldogs} = 2 \times 3 \text{ kg/day} = 6 \text{ kg/day} \]

Adding these together gives us the total daily consumption:

\[ \text{Total daily consumption} = 15 \text{ kg/day (German Shepherds)} + 6 \text{ kg/day (Bulldogs)} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \]

### Step 2: Calculate weekly consumption.
To determine how much dog food is needed in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 days:

\[ \text{Weekly consumption} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 147 \text{ kg/week} \]

Therefore, the kennel will need **147 kg** of dog food per week.<|im_end|>","The German Shepherds consume 3 x 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 kilograms of dog food per day.
The Bulldogs consume 2 x 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 kilograms of dog food per day.
The dogs can consume a total of 15 + 6 = <<15+6=21>>21 kilograms of dog food per day.
Therefore, they need 21 x 7 = <<21*7=147>>147 kilograms of dog food in a week.

<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm based on the given information about the number of different types of animals.

Step 1: Identify the number of two-legged animals.
- The problem states that there are 10 two-legged animals.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of leg pairs from these two-legged animals.
- Each two-legged animal contributes 2 legs, so for 10 such animals, the total number of leg pairs is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

Step 3: Identify the number of four-legged animals.
- The problem states that there are 15 four-legged animals.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of leg pairs from these four-legged animals.
- Each four-legged animal also contributes 2 legs, so for 15 such animals, the total number of leg pairs is \(15 \times 2 = 30\).

Step 5: Add the number of leg pairs from both groups of animals.
- Total number of leg pairs = \(20 + 30 = 50\).

Therefore, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 50.

{The final answer is} 50 pairs of animal legs.<|im_end|>","2-legged animals have 2 legs. Therefore 10 2-legged animals will have 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 legs

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 4 blue blocks.
   - There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
   - The total number of blocks is 32.

2. **Calculate the number of yellow blocks:**
   Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times (\text{Number of blue blocks}) = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Sum the number of blue and yellow blocks:**
   Now that we know the number of blue and yellow blocks, we can add them together to find the total number of these two types of blocks:
   \[
   \text{Total number of blue and yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Determine the number of red blocks:**
   We know the total number of blocks is 32. Therefore, the number of red blocks can be calculated by subtracting the total number of blue and yellow blocks from the total number of blocks:
   \[
   \text{Number of red blocks} = \text{Total number of blocks} - \text{Total number of blue and yellow blocks} = 32 - 12 = 20

5. **Conclusion:**
   The number of red blocks in the tower is 20.

Therefore, the final answer is:

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled during his journey.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled west.
Elvis drives west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So,
\[ \text{Distance}_\text{west} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_\text{west} = 90 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled back east.
After turning around, Elvis drives east for 8 hours at the same average speed (18 mph).

\[ \text{Distance}_\text{east} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_\text{east} = 144 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the net distance from Elvis's starting point.
We need to add the distances traveled in opposite directions.

Since Elvis initially went west and then turned around and went east, we need to subtract the distance traveled east from the distance traveled west:

\[ \text{Net Distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{west} - \text{Distance}_\text{east} \]

Substituting the values calculated earlier:

\[ \text{Net Distance} = 90 \, \text{miles} - 144 \, \text{miles} \]
\[ \text{Net Distance} = -54 \, \text{miles} \]

### Conclusion:
Elvis is 54 miles away from his starting point. The negative value indicates that he is on the west side of his starting point, meaning he is behind his original location.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is}-54 \, \text{miles}.<|im_end|>","During the first part of the journey he travels west for 5 hours at a speed of 18mph so he covered a distance of 5*18 = <<5*18=90>>90 miles

   - Depreciation rate for the first year = 30%
   - Value after the first year (V1) = Initial Cost × (1 - Depreciation Rate)
     \[
     V1 = 9000 \times (1 - 0.30) = 9000 \times 0.70 = 6300
     \]

2. **Calculate the value at the end of the second year:**
   - Value at the start of the second year = $6300
   - Depreciation rate for the second year = 30%
   - Value after the second year (V2) = Value at the start of the second year × (1 - Depreciation Rate)
     \[
     V2 = 6300 \times (1 - 0.30) = 6300 \times 0.70 = 4410

To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of candies**:
   - The total number of candies in the bag is given as 232.

2. **Determine the number of red candies**:
   - We know there are 54 red candies.

3. **Calculate the number of orange candies**:
   - Orange candies are twice the number of red candies.
   - Therefore, the number of orange candies = \( 2 \times 54 = 108 \).

4. **Calculate the number of yellow candies**:
   - Yellow candies are half the number of red candies.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow candies = \( \frac{54}{2} = 27 \).

5. **Subtract the number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total to find the number of pink candies**:
   - Total candies: 232
   - Red candies: 54
   - Orange candies: 108
   - Yellow candies: 27
   - Number of pink candies = \( 232 - (54 + 108 + 27) \)

6. **Perform the subtraction**:
   - Number of pink candies = \( 232 - (54 + 108 + 27) \)
   - Number of pink candies = \( 232 - 195 \)
   - Number of pink candies = \( 37 \)

<|im_start|>system
To determine how much Helen paid for her hotel stays and bus trips, we need to calculate both costs separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the hotel stays
- Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.
- The cost per night at the hotel is $80.

Total cost of the hotel = Number of nights × Cost per night
= 3 × $80
= $240

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the bus rides
- Helen took the bus 7 times.
- Each bus ride costs 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel.

First, let's find out what 10% of one night's stay in the hotel costs:
Cost of one night's stay at the hotel = $80

10% of one night's stay at the hotel:
10% of $80 = (10/100) × $80
= $8

Now, since she takes the bus 7 times:
Total cost of the bus rides = Number of bus rides × Cost per bus ride
= 7 × $8
= $56

### Step 3: Sum the total costs
Total cost of the hotel stays + Total cost of the bus rides
= $240 + $56
= $296

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:

{The final answer is} $296.<|im_end|>","Helen has spent 3 nights at the hotel, so she needed to pay 3 * 80 = $<<3*80=240>>240 for them.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

**Step 1: Determine how many marbles Dallas had initially**

- We know that Dallas ends up with 21 marbles.
- He drops 4 marbles in the playground.

Let \( D \) represent the number of marbles Dallas originally had.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:
\[ D - 4 = 21 \]

Solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 21 + 4 \]
\[ D = 25 \]

So, Dallas initially had 25 marbles.

**Step 2: Calculate how many marbles were given from Mazie to both twins**

- Total marbles at the start (before any were taken away): 52
- Marbles left with Dallas after giving some away: 21

Subtract the number of marbles Dallas ended up with from the initial total:
\[ 52 - 21 = 31 \]

This means 31 marbles were given from Mazie to Dallas and Darla combined.

**Step 3: Find out how many marbles were given to Darla**

Since we have already determined that Dallas received 25 marbles, the remaining marbles must be what Darla received:
\[ 31 - 25 = 6 \]

Therefore, Darla received **6 marbles**.

**Final Answer:**
The final answer is:
{The final answer is} 6 marbles.<|im_end|>","Mazie gave Dallas 21 + 4 = <<21+4=25>>25 marbles.

                    question:
                    John's car breaks down.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and he has luggage in it weighing 250 pounds.  He also has his two , young children who weigh 75 pounds each in it. ,  If the force to move the car is 1% of the weight how much force does he need to push the car?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the force needed to move John's car, we'll follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car**
- Car weight = 1200 pounds
- Luggage weight = 250 pounds
- Children's weight (each) = 75 pounds × 2 = 150 pounds

Total weight = Car weight + Luggage weight + Children's weight
               = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
               = 1600 pounds

**Step 2: Determine the force required to move the car**
- Force required = 1% of the total weight
- Total weight = 1600 pounds

Force required = 1% of 1600 pounds
                = (1/100) × 1600 pounds
                = 16 pounds

Therefore, **the force needed to push the car is 16 pounds**.

{The final answer is} 16 pounds<|im_end|>","His two children weigh 75*2=<<75*2=150>>150 pounds
So the total weight of the car and everything is 1200+250+150=<<1200+250+150=1600>>1600 pounds
So he needs to generate 1600*.01=<<1600*.01=16>>16 pounds

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much crepe paper James needs to buy, we first need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P = 2(l + w) \]

where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle.

Given the dimensions of James's backyard fence:
- Length (\( l \)) = 20 feet
- Width (\( w \)) = 15 feet

Substitute these values into the perimeter formula:

\[ P = 2(20 + 15) \]
\[ P = 2(35) \]
\[ P = 70 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, James needs to buy **70 feet** of crepe paper to hang crepe-paper streamers from his backyard fence.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much crepe paper James needs for the long sides. Since there are two long sides, multiple the side's length by 2: 20 feet * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 feet
Now do the same multiplication to find out how much crepe paper James needs for the short sides: 15 feet * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 feet
Now add the amounts for the short and long sides together to find the total amount of crepe paper needed: 40 feet + 30 feet = <<40+30=70>>70 feet

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To find the average of Mia and Emma's ages, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Emma's current age.
2. Calculate the sum of their ages.
3. Divide the sum by 2 to get the average.

Step 1: Determine Emma's current age.
Since Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma, we can deduce that Emma must be older than 56 (since they are 16 years apart). Let's assume Emma is exactly 56 + x years old where x > 0. Since Mia is younger than Emma, this means x must be less than 16. The smallest integer value for x that satisfies this condition is 1. Therefore, Emma's age is:
\[ \text{Emma's age} = 56 + 1 = 57 \]

Step 2: Calculate the sum of their ages.
Mia is 40 years old, so the sum of their ages is:
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = 40 + 57 = 97 \]

Step 3: Divide the sum by 2 to get the average.
The average of their ages is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{97}{2} = 48.5 \]

Therefore, the average of their ages is \( \boxed{48.5} \).<|im_end|>","If Mia is 40 years old, Emma is 40+16 = <<40+16=56>>56 years old.

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of seashells found by all three.**

- Tom found 214 seashells.
- Nancy found 432 seashells.
- Benny found 86 seashells.

Total seashells = 214 + 432 + 86 = **732** seashells.

**Step 2: Determine how many seashells are cracked.**

According to the information provided, 67% of the total seashells are cracked.

Cracked seashells = 67% of 732.

First, convert the percentage to decimal form (0.67):

Cracked seashells = 0.67 * 732 ≈ **495.84** seashells.

Since we can't have a fraction of a seashell, let's round it to the nearest whole number:

Approximately 500 seashells are cracked.

**Step 3: Subtract the number of cracked seashells from the total number of seashells to find the number of good seashells.**

Good seashells = Total seashells - Cracked seashells

Good seashells = 732 - 500 = **232** seashells.

Therefore, they found **232 good seashells together**.<|im_end|>","Together they found 214 + 432 + 86 = <<214+432+86=732>>732 seashells before cleaning.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>subject
To determine how much Avery will spend on place settings, we need to calculate the total cost for one set of place settings (a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl). Then, since she needs three sets, we multiply this amount by three.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of one set of place settings.
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Total cost for one set = $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00

### Step 2: Add up these costs to find the total for one set.
$6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00

So, the cost for one set of place settings is $15.00.

### Step 3: Determine the total cost for three sets.
Since Avery needs three sets of place settings, we multiply the cost of one set by three.

$15.00 × 3 = $45.00

Therefore, the total amount Avery will spend on place settings is **$45.00**.<|im_end|>","Each place setting will need a dinner plate that’s $6.00, a bowl for $5.00 and a salad plate that’s $4.00 so each place setting will cost 6+5+4 = $<<6+5+4=15.00>>15.00
She needs 12 place settings for her guests and they're $15.00 each so she will spend 12*15 = $<<12*15=180.00>>180.00 on the place settings.

Steve completed the puzzle in 10 hours.

Step 2: Calculate how much longer Anna spent on the puzzle compared to Steve.
Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time.

Step 3: Find out what ""half"" of Steve's time is.
Half of 10 hours is 5 hours.

Step 4: Add the extra 2 hours to find out how long Anna worked.
So, Anna worked for 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours.

Step 5: Verify that Anna's working time matches her description.
Since Anna said she worked 2 hours more than half of Steve's time, let's check if 7 hours fits this description.

Step 6: Confirm the solution.
Anna indeed worked for 7 hours, which is exactly 2 hours more than half of Steve's time (5 hours).

Therefore, the final answer is:
The final answer is: 7 hours.<|im_end|>","Half the time it took Steve to put together the puzzle is 10/2=<<10/2=5>>5

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps:

1. **Calculate daily feed consumption per pig:**
   - Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day.
   - Daily feed consumption for one pig = \( 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \).

2. **Calculate total daily feed consumption for all pigs:**
   - There are 5 pigs.
   - Total daily feed consumption for all pigs = \( 8 \text{ pounds/pig/day} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \).

3. **Calculate weekly feed consumption for all pigs:**
   - Weekly feed consumption for all pigs = \( 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \).

4. **Subtract the total weekly feed consumption from the initial amount ordered:**
   - Initial amount of feed ordered = 300 pounds.
   - Amount of feed used in a week = 280 pounds.
   - Remaining feed after a week = \( 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \).

**Final Answer:** 
The remaining amount of feed after a week is {20}.<|im_end|>","In a day, one pig consumes 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 pounds of feed.
In a day, five pigs consume 8 x 5 = <<8*5=40>>40 pounds.

2. **Determine the total number of hot dogs needed:**
   Each guest eats 2 hot dogs.
   \[
   \text{Total hot dogs needed} = 20 \times 2 = 40

3. **Account for the leftover hot dogs:**
   John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs available} = 4 + 4 = 8 \quad (\text{since he has 4 from one party and 4 more)

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - At the start, there are 5 children chasing the ice cream truck.
   
2. **After the First Street:**
   - Each of the 5 children joins another child.
   - Total number of children = 5 (initial) + 4 (each of the 5 children joining another child) = 9 children.
   
3. **On the Second Street:**
   - Each of the 9 children joins another child.
   - Since each child joins one more child, the total number of children doubles because each of the 9 children will join two new children.
   - Total number of children = 9 (after the first street) * 2 = 18 children.
   
4. **On the Third Street:**
   - Each of the 18 children joins two additional children.
   - Again, since each of the 18 children will join two new children, the total number of children increases again by the same factor.
   - Total number of children = 18 (on the second street) * 2 = 36 children.
   
5. **Final Calculation:**
   - After all the children have rejoined, they decide to stop and leave the group.
   - Therefore, no further children will be added after this point.

Thus, the final number of children still following the truck is 36.

                    James likes to check ; the coin return of the vending machine for change. One day he finds a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes. How much money in cents does James have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to convert each type of coin into its equivalent value in cents and then sum them up.

1. **Quarter**:
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Since James has one quarter, his total from quarters is \(25\) cents.

2. **Nickels**:
   - Each nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - James has two nickels, so his total from nickels is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents.

3. **Dimes**:
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - James has seven dimes, so his total from dimes is \(7 \times 10 = 70\) cents.

Now, let's add up all these values:

- Quarters: \(25\) cents
- Nickels: \(10\) cents
- Dimes: \(70\) cents

Total amount in cents:
\[ 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is} **105 cents**.<|im_end|>","First figure out how much the nickels are worth: 2 * 5 cents = <<2*5=10>>10 cents

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the number of siblings:**
   - There are 2 brothers.
   - There are 3 sisters.

2. **Determine the ages of the sisters:**
   - We know that all sisters are the same age, and one sister is 16 years old.
   - Since they are all the same age, all three sisters must be 16 years old.

3. **Determine the age of the younger brother:**
   - The problem states that one of the brothers is 12 years old.
   - This means the other brother is also 12 years old (since he is half the age of the older brother).

4. **Calculate the total age of the sisters:**
   - Each sister is 16 years old, so the total age for the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.

5. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**
   - Each brother is 12 years old, so the total age for the brothers is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) years.

6. **Add the ages together to get the total age of all siblings:**
   - Total age of the sisters + Total age of the brothers = \(48 + 24 = 72\)

Therefore, the total age of all these siblings is \(\boxed{72}\).<|im_end|>","Three sisters are in total 3 * 16 = <<3*16=48>>48 years old.
The younger brother is only half the age of the older one, which leads us to the older brother being 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 years old.
So all family members in total are 48 + 12 + 24 = <<48+12+24=84>>84 years old.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>wait
To determine how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks, we'll break this down into steps:

**Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on meditation per day**

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes every morning and evening.

\[ \text{Daily meditation duration} = 15 \text{ minutes (morning)} + 15 \text{ minutes (evening)} = 30 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Since there are 5 days a week, her weekly meditation time is:

\[ \text{Weekly meditation time} = 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Over 4 weeks, her total meditation time is:

\[ \text{Total meditation time} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 600 \text{ minutes} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on yoga per week**

Charisma practices yoga for 1 hour each day.

\[ \text{Daily yoga duration} = 1 \text{ hour/day} \]

For 5 days a week, her weekly yoga time is:

\[ \text{Weekly yoga time} = 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \]

Over 4 weeks, her total yoga time is:

\[ \text{Total yoga time} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Convert total time from minutes to hours**

We need to convert the total meditation time from minutes to hours because yoga is already given in hours.

\[ \text{Total time spent on meditation and yoga} = 600 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ hours} \]

Convert 600 minutes to hours:

\[ 600 \text{ minutes} ÷ 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time spent on both meditation and yoga over 4 weeks is:

\[ \text{Total time spent} = 10 \text{ hours (meditation)} + 20 \text{ hours (yoga)} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

**Final Answer:** She has spent **30 hours** on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks.<|im_end|>","She meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night for a total of 15+15 = <<15+15=30>>30 minutes

She meditates 210 minutes in 1 week so in 4 weeks she meditates 210*4 = <<210*4=840>>840 minutes
60 minutes are in an hour so she meditates for 840/60 = <<840/60=14>>14 hours
She practices yoga for 1 hour 5 days a week so that's 1*5 = <<1*5=5>>5 hours
Over 4 weeks she practices yoga for 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 hours

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine the total amount of fabric needed for the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each type of shirt and then sum these areas.

Step 1: Calculate the total fabric used for small shirts.
- Each small shirt requires 3 square feet of fabric.
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts.
\[ \text{Total fabric for small shirts} = 3 \times 11 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total fabric used for medium shirts.
- Each medium shirt requires 4 square feet of fabric.
- Octavia uses 8 medium shirts.
\[ \text{Total fabric for medium shirts} = 4 \times 8 \]

Step 3: Calculate the total fabric used for large shirts.
- Each large shirt requires 6 square feet of fabric.
- Octavia uses 6 large shirts.
\[ \text{Total fabric for large shirts} = 6 \times 6 \]

Step 4: Sum the total fabric required for all types of shirts.
\[
\text{Total fabric} = (3 \times 11) + (4 \times 8) + (6 \times 6)
\]

Now let's perform the calculations:

For small shirts:
\[ 3 \times 11 = 33 \]

For medium shirts:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

For large shirts:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Finally, add up all the values:
\[
\text{Total fabric} = 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \text{ square feet}
\]

Therefore, the total number of square feet in the quilt is \( \boxed{101} \).<|im_end|>","The quilt has 33 square feet from small shirts because 11 x 3 = <<11*3=33>>33

<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower:**
   - A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - Since one dozen equals 12, we calculate \( 3 \times 12 = 36 \) seeds.

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:**
   - A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - To find 50% of the seeds in a small sunflower (36), we use the formula:
     \[
     0.5 \times 36 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, a large sunflower contains \( 36 + 18 = 54 \) seeds.

3. **Sum up the total number of seeds from both types of sunflowers:**
   - Small sunflower: 36 seeds
   - Large sunflower: 54 seeds
   - Total seeds: \( 36 + 54 = 90 \)

Therefore, the total number of sunflower seeds is \(\boxed{90}\).<|im_end|>","The small sunflower has 3 x 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 seeds.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of pens Timothy has:**
   - We know that George has 18 pens.
   - Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has.
   - Therefore, Timothy's total = \( 3 \times \text{George's pens} \).
     \[
     \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of pens Sarah has:**
   - Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
   - Therefore, Sarah's total = \(\frac{\text{Timothy's pens}}{2}\).
     \[
     \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27

   - Albert's height = 36 inches.
   - Therefore, Anne's height = \(2 \times 36\) inches.

\[
Anne's \;height = 72 \;inches
\]

2. **Calculate Jackie's height after the summer:**
   - Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer.
   - Let's denote Jackie's original height as \(J\).
   - After growing 3 inches, her new height = \(J + 3\) inches.

Given that she is now 2 inches shorter than Anne:

\[
J + 3 = 72 - 2
\]

Solving for \(J\):

\[
J + 3 = 70
\]
\[
J = 70 - 3
\]
\[
J = 67

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks.
2. Calculate the total revenue from selling those bars at the given price.

Let's start with the first step:

Step 1: Determine the number of bars produced in two weeks.

Given that the company produces 5000 bars per day, we need to find out how many bars it produces in two days (since there are seven days in a week).

\[ \text{Number of bars in two weeks} = 5000 \times 7 \]

Calculate this:

\[ 5000 \times 7 = 35000 \]

So, the company produces 35,000 bars over two weeks.

Next, let's move on to the second step:

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

We know that the company sells all 35,000 bars for $2 each.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 35000 \times 2 \]

Calculate this:

\[ 35000 \times 2 = 70000 \]

2. Determine the cost of the shoes after applying the 40% discount.
3. Sum up the costs from both items.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts**

- Original price of one T-shirt = $8
- Buy-T-Shirts offer = 50% off
- Cost per T-shirt after discount = $8 * (1 - 0.5) = $8 * 0.5 = $4
- Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, the total cost for T-shirts = 2 * $4 = $8

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes**

- Original price of one shoe = $40
- Shoe offer = 40% off
- Discounted price of one shoe = $40 * (1 - 0.4) = $40 * 0.6 = $24
- Since Jake buys 1 shoe, the total cost for shoes = $24

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how much money Ryan saved from doing his chores.
- Ryan's allowance per week = $6
- Number of weeks he completed his chores = 3

Total savings from chores = Allowance per week × Number of weeks
= $6 × 3
= $18

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount Ryan spent on ice cream cones.
- Cost of one ice cream cone = $1.25
- Number of friends + Ryan = 4 (Ryan included)

Total cost of ice cream cones = Cost per cone × Total number of cones
= $1.25 × 4
= $5

### Step 3: Subtract the ice cream spending from his savings to find out how much money Ryan has left.
Money left after buying ice cream = Savings - Ice cream cost
= $18 - $5
= $13

### Step 4: Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the remaining money.
- Cost of one movie ticket = $6.50
- Money left = $13

Number of movie tickets Ryan can buy = Money left ÷ Cost per ticket
= $13 ÷ $6.50
= 2 (rounded down because you can't buy a fraction of a ticket)

Therefore, Ryan can buy **2** movie tickets.

= $100 + $5
= $105

**Step 2: Calculate Lani's total spending**

- Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30.
- She also bought two bathrobes at $100 each.

Cost of one robe = $100
Number of robes bought by Lani = 2

Total cost of robes by Lani = Cost per robe × Number of robes
= $100 × 2
= $200

Total spent by Lani = Sunglasses + Robes
= $30 + $200
= $230

**Step 3: Calculate the combined total spending**

Combined total spent by Ellen and Lani
= Ellen's total + Lani's total
= $105 + $230
= $335

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[

                    question:
                    Tim makes a special honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit.  It also takes 2 pounds ? of special honey.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user

To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar.
First, let's find out how many pounds of each ingredient are needed for one jar.

- Passion fruit: 2 pounds
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds
- Special honey: 2 pounds (since the question specifies ""It also takes 2 pounds ? of special honey,"" but doesn't specify what that ""??"" represents)

Now calculate the total cost of ingredients for one jar:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (\text{cost per pound of passion fruit} + \text{cost per pound of jackfruit} + \text{cost per pound of honey}) \times \text{number of jars} \]

- Cost of passion fruit: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$12\)
- Cost of jackfruit: \(1.5 \text{ pounds} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12\)
- Cost of honey: \(2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20\)

So, the total cost for one jar is:
\[ \$12 + \$12 + \$20 = \$44 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.
Tim sells each jar for $50.

Thus, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 10 \text{ jars} \times \$50/\text{jar} = \$500 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of ingredients for 10 jars.
Using the same calculation as above, but multiplied by 10 jars instead of just one jar.

Cost of passion fruit for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \text{ jars} \times 2 \text{ pounds/jar} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$120 \]
Cost of jackfruit for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \text{ jars} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/jar} \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$120 \]
Cost of honey for 10 jars:
\[ 10 \text{ jars} \times 2 \text{ pounds/jar} \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$200 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 jars is:
\[ \$120 + \$120 + \$200 = \$440 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit.
Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$500 - \$440 = \$60 \]

### Final Answer:
The final answer is \(\boxed{\$60}\).<|im_end|>","The cost of the passion fruit is 2*6=$<<2*6=12>>12
The jackfruit cost 1.5*8=$<<1.5*8=12>>12
The honey is 2*10=$<<2*10=20>>20
So the total cost for a jar is 12+12+20=$<<12+12+20=44>>44
So the profit per jar is 50-44=$<<50-44=6>>6
So the total profit for 10 jars is 10*6=$<<10*6=60>>60

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superuser
To determine the total dollar amount in Justin's jar, we need to calculate the value contributed by each type of coin and then sum these values.

Step 1: Calculate the value from the quarters.
- Each quarter is worth $0.25.
- There are 32 quarters in the jar.
\[ \text{Value from quarters} = 32 \times 0.25 = \$8.00 \]

Step 2: Calculate the value from the dimes.
- Each dime is worth $0.10.
- There are 95 dimes in the jar.
\[ \text{Value from dimes} = 95 \times 0.10 = \$9.50 \]

Step 3: Calculate the value from the nickels.
- Each nickel is worth $0.05.
- There are 120 nickels in the jar.
\[ \text{Value from nickels} = 120 \times 0.05 = \$6.00 \]

Step 4: Calculate the value from the pennies.
- Each penny is worth $0.01.
- There are 750 pennies in the jar.
\[ \text{Value from pennies} = 750 \times 0.01 = \$7.50 \]

Step 5: Sum the values from all types of coins.
\[ \text{Total value} = \$8.00 + \$9.50 + \$6.00 + \$7.50 = \$30.00 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is $\boxed{\$30.00}$.<|im_end|>","There are 32/4 = <<32/4=8>>8 dollars in quarters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total amount spent:**
   - Ice cream: $3.50
   - Movie tickets (for herself and her younger sister): $7.50 each, so that's 2 tickets at $7.50 each.
     \[
     2 \times 7.50 = 15.00
     \]
   - Bracelet: $8.50

2. **Sum up all expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \$3.50 + \$15.00 + \$8.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   \[

1. Calculate the number of days Josh works.
2. Determine how many cars he services each day.
3. Calculate his daily earnings.
4. Multiply his daily earnings by the total number of working days in two weeks.

Let's go through these steps one by one.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days Josh works
- Josh works from Monday to Friday (Monday to Friday = 5 days)
- He doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday, so that's 2 days out of the 7 days in a week.

Number of working days in one week = 5 - 2 = 3 days

Since Josh works 3 days a week, over 2 weeks he will work for:
\[ \text{Total working days} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many cars he services each day
Josh services 3 cars per day.

### Step 3: Calculate his daily earnings
He earns $4 per car service. Therefore, his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 3 \times \$4 = \$12 \]

### Step 4: Multiply his daily earnings by the total number of working days in two weeks
His total earnings over 2 weeks can now be calculated by multiplying his daily earnings by the total number of working days in two weeks:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$12 \times 6 = \$72 \]

Therefore, Josh makes $\boxed{72}$ dollars in 2 weeks.<|im_end|>","He runs 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days a week

1. **Initial Counting**:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Eating Cookies**:
   - Randy eats 3 cookies in total.
   - One cookie from each flavor (oatmeal, chocolate chip, and sugar).

   So, Randy eats:
   - 1 oatmeal cookie
   - 1 chocolate chip cookie
   - 1 sugar cookie

   After eating:
   - Remaining oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
   - Remaining chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
   - Remaining sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

3. **Baking Cookies**:
   - Randy bakes 4 of each flavor.

   So, after baking:

<|im_start|>subject
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Calculate how many holes Nate's dog digs during his vacation.
- The dog digs at a rate of 6 holes per day.
- Nate is gone for 14 days.

\[ \text{Total holes dug} = 6 \times 14 \]

\[ \text{Total holes dug} = 84 \]

### Step 2: Determine how many holes Nate fills in after returning from vacation.
- Nate fills in at a rate of 9 holes per day.

Let \( x \) be the number of days it takes for Nate to fill up all the holes.

\[ \text{Holes filled} = 9x \]

Since Nate has already dug 84 holes, we set these equal to find out when they match:

\[ 9x = 84 \]

Solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{84}{9} \]

\[ x \approx 9.33 \]

This means Nate needs approximately 9.33 days to fill all the holes. Since he cannot work for a fraction of a day, we round up to the next whole day (since partial days don't count as full days for this context).

So, it takes Nate about 10 days to fill all the holes.

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.

We know that Nate worked for 14 days initially, plus an additional 10 days to finish filling all the holes.

Therefore, the total time taken is:

\[ 14 + 10 = 24 \text{ days} \]

Convert days into weeks:

\[ \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{24}{7} \]

\[ \text{Number of weeks} \approx 3.43 \]

Thus, it takes Nate approximately **3.43** weeks to fill all the holes.<|im_end|>","First find the number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation: 14 days * 6 holes/day = <<14*6=84>>84 holes

Then divide the total number of holes by the daily decrease in the number of holes to find the number of days Nate spends filling in holes: 84 holes / 3 holes/day = <<84/3=28>>28 days

To determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the average number of students at Butler High School:**
   - Norman High School has an average enrollment of 4000 students.
   - Butler High School enrolls \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.

2. **Multiply the number of students at Norman High School by \( \frac{3}{4} \):**
   \[
   \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = 4000 \times \frac{3}{4}
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   4000 \times \frac{3}{4} = 4000 \times 0.75 = 3000
   \]

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students per year.

4. **Determine the difference in enrollment between the two schools:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
   \]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is \( 1000 \) more than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>super
To determine how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of cookies made so far:**
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 7995
   \]

2. **Subtract the number of rainbow cookies from the total number of cookies:**
   \[
   \text{Rainbow cookies} = 2595
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after removing rainbow cookies} = 7995 - 2595 = 5400
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of oatmeal cookies from the remaining number of cookies:**
   \[
   \text{Oatmeal cookies} = 3075
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining after removing oatmeal cookies} = 5400 - 3075 = 2325
   \]

Now, at this point, we know that there are 2325 cookies left after accounting for the rainbow and oatmeal cookies. These remaining cookies must be either chocolate chip or another type (which we don't yet know). Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies can only be determined if we know whether the remaining cookies were all chocolate chip.

Since we do not have enough information about what else was included in the count of remaining cookies, we cannot accurately calculate the exact number of chocolate chip cookies without additional data.

Given the current information, we cannot definitively state the number of chocolate chip cookies made. However, if we assume that the remaining cookies are entirely chocolate chip, then the calculation would proceed as follows:

\[
\text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 2325
\]

Thus, the final answer assuming all remaining cookies are chocolate chip is:

How many beakers did Igor lose?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Gathering:**
   - Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes.
   - Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers.
   - Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes.

2. **Igor's Gathering:**
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested (1/2 * 16 = 8 test tubes).
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested (14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes).

3. **Items Lost:**
   - Igor lost some beakers during transportation.

4. **Total Items Placed on the Lab Bench:**
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

5. **Calculating Beaker Loss:**
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of beakers Igor lost.
   - Therefore, the number of beakers Igor has is \( 7 - x \).

Now let's set up an equation based on the given information:

- Test Tubes: 8 (gathered) + 0 (lost) = 8
- Beakers: \( 7 - x \)
- Petri Dishes: 16 (gathered)

The sum of these should equal the total number of items on the lab bench:
\[ 8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \]
\[ 31 - x = 29 \]

Subtract 31 from both sides:
\[ -x = 29 - 31 \]
\[ -x = -2 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ x = 2 \]

Therefore, Igor lost **2** beakers.<|im_end|>","On the lab bench, there were half of the requested number of test tubes, or 16/2=<<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Since the remaining items on the bench were beakers, there were 29-8-16=<<29-8-16=5>>5 beakers on the lab bench.
Thus, Igor lost 7-5=<<7-5=2>>2 beakers.

To determine how many screws James will have left over after assembling his tables, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs needed for all tables:**
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of screws required:**
   - Each leg requires 2 screws.
   
   \[
   \text{Total screws needed} = 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws}
   \]

3. **Compare the total screws needed with the screws available:**
   - James has 40 screws in total.

4. **Calculate the number of screws left over:**
   - Subtract the total screws needed from the total screws available.
   
   \[
   \text{Screws left over} = 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws}
   \]

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Determine the number of eggs in the first basket.
- We know that there are 10 eggs in the first basket.

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs in the second basket.
- The problem states that there are twice as many eggs in the second basket compared to the first basket.

Let's calculate the number of eggs in the second basket:
- Number of eggs in the first basket = 10
- Number of eggs in the second basket = 2 * (Number of eggs in the first basket)

So,
\[ \text{Number of eggs in the second basket} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Step 3: Add the number of eggs from both baskets together.
- Total number of eggs in both baskets = Number of eggs in the first basket + Number of eggs in the second basket

So,
\[ \text{Total number of eggs} = 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets combined is 30.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then sum these amounts. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Determine how much Kim raised:**
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
   - Alexandra raised $430.
   - Therefore, Kim raised = $430 + $320.

\[
\text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
\]

2. **Determine how much Maryam raised:**
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.
   - Sarah raised $300.
   - Therefore, Maryam raised = $300 + $400.

\[
\text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}

3. **Sum up the amounts raised by all three girls:**

\[
\text{Total amount raised} = \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}

If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, how long in minutes . did Vanessa take to complete her part?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race based on the information given about their running speeds and distances.

### Step 1: Determine Aaron's speed relative to Vanessa.
- We know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Let \( v \) represent Vanessa's speed (in miles per minute).

Given:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = 2v \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Aaron can cover in 16 minutes.
Since Aaron completes one mile in the same amount of time he takes for Vanessa to run half that distance:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron covers in 16 minutes} = 16 \times 2v = 32v \]

We also know from the problem statement that Vanessa runs 4 miles in total.

### Step 3: Calculate the distance Aaron covers.
Since Vanessa runs 4 miles in total:
\[ \text{Distance Aaron covers} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Determine the time it takes for Vanessa to complete her part of the race.
Vanessa runs 4 miles at her full speed \( v \). To find out how long it takes her, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa takes} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles/minute}} \]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression.
We already have the expression for Vanessa’s speed:
\[ v \text{ miles/minute} \]

So,
\[ \text{Time Vanessa takes} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{v \text{ miles/minute}} = \frac{4}{v} \text{ minutes} \]

### Final Answer:
Therefore, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{v}}

To determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length required:**
   - The caretaker wants 3 feet of line per foot of dock.
   - There are currently 200 feet of dock.

   \[
   \text{Total length needed} = 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock}

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of meals ordered per day:**
   - Tom orders 2 meals.
   - Each meal costs $5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one meal is \( 2 \times \$5 = \$10 \).
   - Since there are 6 reservations a night, Tom will have enough food for \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) meals.

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the meals:**
   - The price per meal is $10.
   - With 12 meals sold, the total revenue is \( 12 \times \$10 = \$120 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the bottles of wine:**
   - There is only one bottle of wine.
   - The bottle costs $5.
   - So, the total cost for the wine is \( \$5 \).

4. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated as revenue minus cost.
   - Revenue from meals: \( \$120 \)
   - Cost of wine: \( \$5 \)
   - Net profit: \( \$120 - \$5 = \$115 \)

5. **Determine the number of weeks Tom operates:**
   - Tom is open 2 days a week.
   - In a week, he has \( 7 \) days.
   - Number of weeks he operates in a week is \( \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \) (rounded down to 3 since partial weeks aren't counted in this context).

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price after the profit:**
   - The fruit vendor bought the watermelons for $80.
   - He made a profit of 25% on his purchase.

   Let's denote the cost per watermelon as \( C \).

   Since he bought 50 watermelons for $80, the cost per watermelon is:
   \[
   C = \frac{80}{50} = 1.6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total amount of profit:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 50 \times (C \times 0.25) = 50 \times (1.6 \times 0.25) = 50 \times 0.4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Therefore, the total selling price before tax is:
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Per Watermelon} + \text{Profit} = 1.6 + 20 = 21.6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the selling price per watermelon:**
   - There are 50 watermelons in total that were sold.
   
   So, the selling price per watermelon is:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{50} = \frac{21.6}{50} = 0.432 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for \( \$0.432 \).<|im_end|>","The fruit vendor's profit for the 50 watermelons was $80 x 25/100 = $<<80*25/100=20>>20.

                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine James' current age.
John has a son named James, who was born when John was 19. Therefore, James was born at the age of 0 (since no one can be older than their own birth year).

- John's age at birth = 19
- Since James is currently twice as old as Dora, we need to find out how many years have passed since James was born until now.

Let's denote the number of years that have passed since James was born as \( x \). So, James' current age is \( 2x \).

Since John is now 45 (because he is 19 + \( x \) years), we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x = 45 - 19 \]
\[ 2x = 26 \]
\[ x = 13 \]

So, James is currently 26 years old.

### Step 2: Determine Dora's current age.
Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so she is currently \( 12 - 3 = 9 \) years old.

### Step 3: Calculate John's current age.
John is now 45 years old.

### Step 4: Determine John's youngest son's current age.
John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so he was born at the age of 32.

- The difference between John's current age and the age at which his youngest son was born is \( 45 - 32 = 13 \).
- Since his youngest son was born at the age of 32, we add these 13 years to get his current age:
\[ 32 + 13 = 45 \]

### Step 5: Determine John's youngest son's age in 3 years.
Since his youngest son is currently 45 years old, in 3 years he will be:
\[ 45 + 3 = 48 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
{The final answer is} 48.<|im_end|>","Dora is 12-3=<<12-3=9>>9
So James is 9*2=<<9*2=18>>18 years old
That means John is 18+19=<<18+19=37>>37
Johns youngest son is 37-32=<<37-32=5>>5 years old
So he will be 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 in 3 years

3. **Calculate the number of oranges each person can peel in one minute:**
   - Ana peels oranges at a rate of 3 oranges per minute.
   - Jane peels oranges at a rate of 4 oranges per minute.

4. **Calculate the total number of oranges each person can peel in one hour:**
   - For Ana:
     \[

   - Jane can peel 240 oranges.

6. **Determine how many more oranges Ana can peel compared to Jane:**
   \[

                    Mark's car breaks down and he needs to get a new radiator.  The cost for a ! new radiator is $400 but he goes to get it at a junk shop and gets it for 80% off.  He then hires a mechanic to install it and it takes . 3 hours at $50 an hour.  ? How much did he pay?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mark pays for both the radiator and the installation. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the discounted price of the radiator:**
   - Original price of the radiator = $400
   - Discount rate = 80%
   - Discounted price = Original price × (1 - Discount rate)
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 400 \times (1 - 0.8) = 400 \times 0.2 = \$80
   \]

2. **Calculate the labor cost for installing the radiator:**
   - Labor rate per hour = $50
   - Time spent on installation = 0.3 hours
   - Total labor cost = Labor rate × Hours
   \[
   \text{Total Labor Cost} = 50 \times 0.3 = \$15
   \]

3. **Add the discounted price of the radiator and the total labor cost to find the total amount paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Discounted Price of Radiator} + \text{Total Labor Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 80 + 15 = \$95
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is {The final answer is}: $95.<|im_end|>","The discount on the radiator was 400*.8=$<<400*.8=320>>320
So he paid 400-320=$<<400-320=80>>80
The mechanic charges 3*50=$<<3*50=150>>150
So in total he paid 80+150=$<<80+150=230>>230

                    Think step by step through the following problem and clearly show each step of your reasoning. Ensure the final answer is clearly indicated by ending with {The final answer is}.
                    question:
                    Farmer Brown has 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows. They have a total of 70 . legs, all together. How many of the animals are chickens?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>superior
To solve this problem, let's define two variables:

- Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
- Let \( k \) represent the number of cows.

We know from the problem statement that there are 20 animals in total. Therefore, we can write our first equation as:

\[ c + k = 20 \]

Next, we need to consider the legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs for all the animals is given as 70. We can write our second equation based on the number of legs:

\[ 2c + 4k = 70 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( 2c + 4k = 70 \)

First, let's simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[ c + 2k = 35 \]

Now we have:

1. \( c + k = 20 \)
2. \( c + 2k = 35 \)

Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( c \):

\[ (c + 2k) - (c + k) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ c + 2k - c - k = 15 \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now substitute \( k = 15 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):

\[ c + 15 = 20 \]
\[ c = 20 - 15 \]
\[ c = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. To verify, if there are 5 chickens and 15 cows, then the total number of animals is:

\[ 5 + 15 = 20 \]

And the total number of legs is:

\[ 5 \times 2 + 15 \times 4 = 10 + 60 = 70 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the final answer is:

{The final answer is} 5<|im_end|>","Let C be the number of chickens.
There are 20-C cows.
The cows have 4*(20-C) legs.
The cows have 2C legs.
The total number of legs is 2C+4(20-C)=70.
2C+80-4C=70
2C=10
C=<<5=5>>5

                    question:
                    . Henry and 3 of his friends order 7 pizzas , for lunch. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. If Henry and his friends want to share the pizzas equally, how many slices can each of them have?
                <|im_end|>
<|im_start|>system
To determine how many slices each person can have if they want to share the pizzas equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices from all the pizzas:**
   - Each pizza has 8 slices.
   - There are 7 pizzas in total.

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza}
\]

\[
\text{Total slices} = 7 \times 8 = 56
\]

2. **Determine the number of people sharing the pizzas:**
   - Henry + 3 friends = 4 people (Henry + 3 friends)

\[
\text{Number of people} = 4
\]

3. **Divide the total number of slices by the number of people:**

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Number of people}}
\]

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

### Conclusion:
Each person can have \(14\) slices.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
